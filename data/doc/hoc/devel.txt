Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor is inversely related to expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and progesterone receptor in primary breast tumors and is a negative predictor for response to endocrine therapy . To investigate a possible causal role of EGF receptor expression in breast cancer progression to hormone independence , we have created an experimental cell system . Epidermal growth factor receptor complementary DNA was introduced in estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells , and the resulting ZR/HERc cells exhibited a mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor , thus bypassing estrogen dependence . This EGF-induced proliferation could not be inhibited by antiestrogens . In addition , we noted changes in cell morphology and keratin expression of EGF-stimulated ZR/HERc cells , suggestive of an altered differentiation state . Furthermore , intolerance of functional ER and EGF receptor signal transduction pathways in ZR/HERc cells was observed during simultaneous activation , which possibly explains the inverse relationship of ER and EGF receptor expression in primary tumors . In contrast to the parental cells , ZR/HERc cells rapidly progressed to a stable ER-negative phenotype when cultured in the presence of the antiestrogen hydroxy-tamoxifen . These results suggest a possible role for EGF receptor in progression of breast cancer to hormone independence .	9	93	92
OBJECTIVES Epiphyseal cartilage is a barrier to osteosarcoma invasion , however the mechanisms behind this resistance remain unclear . The aim of this study was to examine the chronological and spatial patterns of osteosarcoma growth and invasion of local tissue structures including epiphyseal cartilage . METHODS We used an in vivomouse model of osteosarcoma to histologically examine tumors at different stages of disease progression . We compared the pattern of osteosarcoma penetration of epiphyseal cartilage with the expression pattern of two potent mediators of angiogenesis ; proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and antiangiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF ) . RESULTS Epiphyseal cartilage remained intact across its entire length in all sections examined , despite increasing tumor size as well as intra- and extraosseous destruction . In the most advanced cases , only the proangiogenic lowermost layers of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate were eroded . This corresponded with the growth plate layers which highly expressed the angiogenic factor VEGF . In contrast , the resting , proliferative and upper hypertrophic layers were resistant to osteosarcoma invasion in all cases . This corresponded to the layers with the highest expression of the potent antiangiogenic factor PEDF . CONCLUSION Epiphyseal cartilage is resistant to local invasion by osteosarcoma . The balance of angiogenesis , influenced by pro- and antiangiogenic factors , is likely to play an important role in this resistance .	11	7	711	1	71
Macrophages are the prominent components of solid tumors and have complex dual functions in their interaction with cancer cells . Strong evidence suggests that TAM is a part of inflammatory circuits that promote tumor progression . B7-homologue 3 ( B7-H3 ) , a recently identified homologue of B7.1/2 ( CD80/86 ) , has been described to exert co-stimulatory and immune regulatory functions . Here , we showed that a fraction of macrophages in tumor stroma expressed surface B7-H3 molecule . Normal macrophages , which did not express B7-H3 , would be induced expressing B7-H3 molecule when culturing with tumor cell . Although a lung cancer cell line constitutively expressed B7-H3 mRNA and protein in plasma , primary tumor cell isolated from the transplanted lung carcinoma model expressed B7-H3 on the surface . Interestingly , in transplanted lung carcinoma model , the expression of membrane-bound B7-H3 in tumor cells was increased as prolonging of tumor transformation . In support , IL-10 released from TAM could stimulate cancer cell expression of membrane bound B7-H3 . Furthermore , Lung cancer and TAM-related B7-H3 was identified as a strong inhibitor of T-cell effect and influenced the outcome of T cell immune response . In conclusion , TAM-tumor cell interaction-induced membrane-bound B7-H3 represents a novel immune escape mechanism which links the pro-inflammatory response to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu .	2	21
To examine the association of cell cycle regulatory gene inactivation with human cell immortalization , we determined the expression status of INK4a , Rb , and WAF1/ CIP1 , in eleven in vitro immortalized human cell lines , including fibroblasts and keratinocytes . Two human papillomavirus type 16 E6 expressing cell lines with telomerase activity , including a fibroblast cell line and a keratinocyte cell line , expressed no detectable p16(INK4a) . These cell lines had a hyperphosphorylated pRb and reduced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) . All of seven fibroblast cell lines immortalized either spontaneously or by ( 60)Co , X-rays , 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide or aflatoxin B(1) , maintaining their telomeres by the ALT ( alternative lengthening of telomeres ) pathway , displayed loss of expression of p16(INK4a) and hyperphosphorylation of pRb . Levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression varied among the cell lines . Two fibroblast cell lines that became immortalized following infection with a retrovirus vector encoding human telomerase catalytic subunit ( hTERT ) cDNA were also accompanied by inactivation of p16(INK4a) and pRb pathways . Acquisition of telomerase activity alone was not sufficient for immortalization of these cell lines . Taken together , all the cell lines including fibroblasts and keratinocytes , with either telomerase activity or the ALT pathway for telomere maintenance showed loss of expression of p16(INK4a) and hyperphosphorylation of pRb . These demonstrate the association of inactivation of both p16(INK4a) and pRb with immortalization of human cells including fibroblasts and epithelial cells and telomerase-positive cells and ALT-positive cells .	4	41
OBJECTIVE To sort and identify side population ( SP ) cancer stem cells ( CSC ) in human prostate cancer ( PCa ) cell lines . METHODS Stem-like cells were isolated from five PCa cell lines Du145 , IA8 , LNCaP , TSU-Pr and PC-3 using FACS based on CD133+ CD44+ immunophenotype and SP in Hoechst staining . The in vitro growth pattern and tumorigenicity of SP stem cells were verified by soft agar colony-formation trial . LNCaP/SP cells were selected for further identification of stem cell properties using immunostaining , proliferation and invasion assay . Eventually , tumorigenicity and metastasis ability of LNCaP/SP were confirmed by xenograft experiments . RESULTS The percentages of CSCs of the CD133 CD44 + immunophenotype were extremely low in the five PCa cell lines . On the contrary , the percentages of the isolated SP cells were significantly higher in Du145 ( [ 0.15 +/- 0.02]% ) , IA8 ( [ 0.60 +/- 0.07 ]% ) , LNCaP ( [ 0.8 +/- 0.1]% ) and TSU-PrL ( [ 2.0 +/- 0.4]% ) , but none was detected in PC-3 . Besides , IA8/SP , LNCaP/SP and TSU-PrL/SP cells showed a significantly greater colony-forming efficiency than non-side population ( NSP ) cells ( P < 0.05 ) . Compared with LNCaP/NSP cells , LNCaP/SP cells exhibited high expressions of integrin alpha2 , Nanog , CD44 , OCT4 and ABCG2 , remarkably enhanced invasive and proliferative potentials in vitro , and markedly increased tumorigenicity and metastasis ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION SP sorting is more suitable than CD133+ CD44+ selection for enriching CSCs from PCa cell lines , and LNCaP/ SP represents a typical CSC population .	1
Silver nanoparticles ( Ag-np ) have been used in medicine and commercially due to their anti-microbial properties . Therapeutic potentials of these nanoparticles are being explored extensively despite the lack of information on their mechanism of action at molecular and cellular level . Here , we have investigated the DNA damage response and repair following Ag-np treatment in mammalian cells . Studies have shown that Ag-np exerts genotoxicity through double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . DNA-PKcs , the catalytic subunit of DNA dependent protein kinase , is an important caretaker of the genome which is known to be the main player mediating Non-homologous End-Joining ( NHEJ ) repair pathway . We hypothesize that DNA-PKcs is responsible for the repair of Ag-np induced DNA damage . In vitro studies have been carried out to investigate both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by Ag-np in normal human cells , DNA-PKcs proficient , and deficient mammalian cells . Chemical inhibition of DNA-PKcs activity with NU7026 , an ATP-competitive inhibitor of DNA-PKcs , has been performed to further validate the role of DNA-PKcs in this model . Our results suggest that Ag-np induced more prominent dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in DNA-PKcs deficient or inhibited cells . The deficiency or inhibition of DNA-PKcs renders the cells with higher susceptibility to DNA damage and genome instability which in turn contributed to greater cell cycle arrest/cell death . These findings support the fact that DNA-PKcs is involved in the repair of Ag-np induced genotoxicity and NHEJ repair pathway and DNA-PKcs particularly is activated to safeguard the genome upon Ag-np exposure .	8	62	6	61
The molecular mechanism mediating expression of senescent cell antigen-aggregated or cleaved band 3 and externalized phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the surface of aged erythrocytes and their premature expression in certain anemias is not completely elucidated . The erythrocytes with these surface modifications undergo macrophage-mediated phagocytosis . In this study , the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms in the expression of these surface modifications was investigated . Inhibition of PKC α by 30 μM rottlerin ( R30 ) and 2.3 nM G� 6976 caused expression of both the senescent cell marker-externalized PS measured by FACS analysis and aggregated band 3 detected by western blotting . In contrast to this observation , but in keeping with literature , PKC activation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) also led to the expression of senescence markers . We explain this antithesis by demonstrating that PMA-treated cells show reduction in the activity of PKC α , thereby simulating inhibition . The reduction in PKC α activity may be attributed to the known downregulation of PMA-activated PKC α , caused by its membrane translocation and proteolysis . We demonstrate membrane translocation of PKC α in PMA-treated cells to substantiate this inference . Thus loss of PKC α activity either by inhibition or downregulation can cause surface modifications which can trigger erythrophagocytosis .	42	4
New molecularly targeted therapies are needed for childhood ependymoma . Angiogenesis and the PDGFR pathway could be potential therapeutic targets . This study aimed to screen ependymomas for the expression and clinicopathological correlates of angiogenic factors and potential therapeutic targets including VEGFR , endoglin ( CD105 ) , CD34 , CD31 , c-Kit , PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β . Immunohistochemistry for angiogenesis factors and PDGFR-α and β was performed in 24 archival tumor samples from children and adults treated for ependymoma at our institution . CD31 density , CD105 density and pericyte coverage index ( PCI ) were calculated . These findings were correlated with clinical outcome . VEGFR2 was overexpressed in tumor cells in only one out of 24 cases , but was found overexpressed in the vessels in 6 cases . PDGFR-α and β were found to be over-expressed in the ependymoma tumor cells in seven out of 24 cases ( 29.2 % ) . CD31 density , CD105 density and PCI did not correlate with expression of PDGFRs . Overexpression of PDGFR-α and β in tumor cells and overexpression of PDGFR-α in tumor endothelium had prognostic significance and this was maintained in multivariate analysis for overexpression of PDGFR-α in tumor cells ( 2 year progression free survival was 16.7 ± 15.2 for cases with overexpression of PDGFR-α in the tumor vs. 74.5 ± 15.2 for those with low/no expression , hazard ratio = 5.78 , p = 0.04 ) . A number of angiogenic factors are expressed in ependymoma tumor cells and tumor endothelium . Preliminary evidence suggests that the expression of PDGFRs could have a prognostic significance in ependymoma . This data suggests that PDGFRs should be further evaluated as targets using novel PDGFR inhibitors .	71	7	711
OBJECTIVE To investigate a potential mechanism of invasion and metastasis of oral cancers , and the possibility of the adhesion molecules being markers for evaluating the prognosis of oral cancers . METHODS Randomly selecting achieved paraffin blocks , including 60 cases of squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) , 30 cases of verrucous carcinoma(VC) of oral mucosa and 30 cases of basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) of epidermis . All cases were followed up . Using immunohistochemistry method ( Envision ) to detect the expression of E-cadherin antibody and observe under light microscope . RESULTS The studies demonstrated that 38.2% of SCC had recurrence and/or metastases after operation . However , only 0.0% and 0.04% , in VC and BCC , respectively , had recurrence and/or metastases . There was significant difference on prognoses between SCC and VC or BCC . The immunostaining showed significant difference of E-cad expression between SCC and VC ( P<0.01 ) , SCC and BCC ( P<0.05 ) . The former was weaker than VC and BCC . However , no difference was showed in E-cad expression between VC and BCC ( P>0.05 ) . CONCLUSION E-cad plays an important role in maintaining the phenotype of epithelial cell of SCC and normal oral mucosa . The degree of expression of E-cad was correlated with the ability of invasion and/or metastasis of SCC , VC and BCC . It indicates that E-cad may be as a helpful marker to evaluate the prognosis of oral cancers .	1	12
DNA polymerases beta ( pol beta ) and eta ( pol eta ) are the only two eukaryotic polymerases known to efficiently bypass cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts in vitro . Frameshift errors are an important aspect of mutagenesis . We have compared the types of frameshifts that occur during translesion synthesis past cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts in vitro by pol beta and pol eta on a template containing multiple runs of nucleotides flanking a single platinum-GG adduct . Translesion synthesis past platinum adducts by pol beta resulted in approximately 50% replication products containing single-base deletions . For both adducts the majority of -1 frameshifts occurred in a TTT sequence 3-5 bp upstream of the DNA lesion . For pol eta , all of the bypass products for both cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts contained -1 frameshifts in the upstream TTT sequence and most of the products of replication on oxaliplatin-damaged templates had multiple replication errors , both frameshifts and misinsertions . In addition , on platinated templates both polymerases generated replication products 4-8 bp shorter than the full-length products . The majority of short cisplatin-induced products contained an internal deletion which included the adduct . In contrast , the majority of oxaliplatin-induced short products contained a 3 ' terminal deletion . The implications of these in vitro results for in vivo mutagenesis are discussed .	61	63	611	6
The ultraviolet radiation present in sunlight is immune suppressive . Recently we showed that solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation ( ultraviolet A + B ; 295-400 nm ) , applied after immunization , suppressed immunologic memory and the elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity to the common opportunistic pathogen , Candida albicans . Further , we found that wavelengths in the ultraviolet A region of the solar spectrum ( 320-400 nm ) , devoid of ultraviolet B , were equally effective in activating immune suppression as ultraviolet A + B radiation . Here we report on the mechanisms involved . Maximal immune suppression was found when mice were exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation 7-9 d post immunization . No immune suppression was found in ultraviolet-irradiated mice injected with monoclonal anti-interleukin-10 antibody , or mice exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation and injected with recombinant interleukin-12 . Suppressor lymphocytes were found in the spleens of mice exposed to ultraviolet A + B radiation . In addition , antigen-specific suppressor T cells ( CD3+ , CD4+ , DX5+ ) were found in the spleens of mice exposed to ultraviolet A radiation . Applying liposomes containing bacteriophage T4N5 to the skin of mice exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet A + B radiation , or mice exposed to ultraviolet A radiation , blocked immune suppression , demonstrating an essential role for ultraviolet-induced DNA damage in the suppression of established immune reactions . These findings indicate that overlapping immune suppressive mechanisms are activated by ultraviolet A and ultraviolet A + B radiation . Moreover , our findings demonstrate that ultraviolet radiation activates similar immunologic pathways to suppress the induction of , or the elicitation of , the immune response .	21	22	61	2	6
OBJECTIVES Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulates cell proliferation by binding to its receptor ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) , and the overexpression of this receptor is associated with poorer prognosis . The EGF gene presents a polymorphism at position 61 ( A/G ) , associated with higher EGF production . We examined the association between this polymorphism and cervical cancer through a case-control study . METHODS This study used the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method on a sample of 384 women with cervical lesions and 500 controls of white ethnicity . RESULTS In cases of cervical cancer , we found an increased risk of progression to advanced disease ( The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIb/IV ) ( odds ratios=2.05 ; 95% confidence intervals=1.11 to 3.79 ; P=0.021 ) , and this risk was particularly evident in G carriers for younger women ( odds ratios=2.96 ; 95% confidence intervals=1.41-6.20 , P=0.003 ) . CONCLUSIONS We hypothesize the onset of an advanced disease-driven selective pressure due to the effect of oncogenic human papillomavirus types in a favorable genetic background observed in G carrier women . These results suggest that EGF functional polymorphism may influence cervical cancer prognosis through an EGF/epidermal growth factor receptor pathway .	9	93	92
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are activated in a wide range of human cancers . In many cases , concomitant inhibition of both pathways is necessary to block proliferation and induce cell death and tumor shrinkage . Several feedback systems have been described in which inhibition of one intracellular pathway leads to activation of a parallel signaling pathway , thereby decreasing the effectiveness of single-agent targeted therapies . In this study , we describe a feedback mechanism in which MEK inhibition leads to activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in EGFR and HER2-driven cancers . We found that MEK inhibitor-induced activation of PI3K/AKT resulted from hyperactivation of ERBB3 as a result of the loss of an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation in the conserved juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 . Mutation of this amino acid led to increased ERBB receptor activation and upregulation of the ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway , which was no longer responsive to MEK inhibition . Taken together , these results elucidate an important , dominant feedback network regulating central oncogenic pathways in human cancer .	9	921	93	92
Cell kinetics and activity of ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC ) were studied during the process of 1-hydroxyanthraquinone ( 1-HA)-induced intestinal carcinogenesis in rats . Starting at 6 weeks of age , a total of 37 male ACI/N rats were divided into two groups and treated as follows : group I ( 18 rats ) received diet containing 1% 1-HA for 12 months ; group II ( 19 rats ) was given the basal diet alone . Sub-groups of 5-7 rats were sequentially killed at 4 , 8 and 12 months for evaluation of the length , cell numbers and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ( BrDU ) labeling indices of large bowel crypts together with ODC activity . All kinetic and ODC data indicated increased DNA synthesis and proliferation at all time points . Morphological observation of the intestines also revealed melanosis , crypt abscesses and erosion , becoming more pronounced with length of exposure to the anthraquinone . The data thus suggest that cell proliferation in the crypts of the cecum or colon is important for 1-HA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis .	9
INTRODUCTION Natural herbal compounds with novel actions different from existing breast cancer ( BCa ) treatment modalities are attractive for improving therapeutic efficacy and safety . We have recently shown that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose ( PGG ) induced S-phase arrest in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells through inhibiting DNA replicative synthesis and G(1) arrest , in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of exposure . We and others have shown that PGG through intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection exerts a strong in vivo growth suppression of human PCa xenograft models in athymic nude mice . This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of PGG are applicable to BCa cells , especially those lacking proven druggable targets . METHODS Mono-layer cell culture models of p53-wild type estrogen receptor ( ER)-dependent MCF-7 BCa cells and p53-mutant ER-/progesterone receptor ( PR)- and Her2-regular ( triple-negative ) MDA-MB-231 BCa were exposed to PGG for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular targets/mediators . To test the in vivo efficacy , female athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 xenograft were treated with 20mg PGG/kg body weight by daily gavage starting 4 days after cancer cell inoculation . RESULTS Exposure to PGG induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine ( BrdU ) incorporation into S-phase cells as well as G(1) arrest . Higher levels of PGG induced more caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 , in strong association with induction of P53 Ser(15) phosphorylation , than in MDA-MB-231 cells . The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1) . PGG treatment led to decreased cyclin D1 in both cell lines and over-expressing cyclin D1 attenuated G(1) arrest and hastened S arrest . In serum-starvation synchronized MCF-7 cells , down-regulation of cyclin D1 was associated with de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein by PGG shortly before G(1)-S transition . In vivo , oral administration of PGG led to a greater than 60% inhibition of MDA-MB231 xenograft growth without adverse effect on host body weight . CONCLUSIONS Our in vitro and in vivo data support PGG as a potential drug candidate for breast cancer with novel targeting actions , especially for a triple negative BCa xenograft model .	9	51	511	5	91	8	81
Currently there is no good hepatocyte model for studying growth hormone ( GH ) function that reflects its normal physiological roles . Here we report the establishment of a functional hepatocyte cell line , SDRL-1 , from the liver of young male spontaneous dwarf rats ( SDR ) , with isolated GH deficiency . This line has been maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) with retention of a near diploid karyotype for extended periods of time . When grown as a monolayer sheet , it displayed a pavement-like appearance and contact inhibition . These cells have a poorly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum ( r-ER ) , few mitochondria and glycogen granules , and produce a small amount of albumin and α-fetoprotein , that is enhanced when grown on a collagen gel sponge . Human recombinant GH stimulated JAK2 and STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation and IGF-I production in a concentration-dependent manner . When the cells were cultured with GH-supplemented medium , the number of mitochondria and glycogen granules increased together with the r-ER and Golgi apparatus . A number of microvilli were observed on the surface of the cultured cells , further suggesting that this cell line is composed of normally functioning hepatocytes . In summary , we established a novel hepatocyte cell line ( SDRL-1 ) , that appears to display normal function , which we propose can serve as a good in vitro model for studying GH-target organ interactions .	5	52
The aberrant expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) has been detected in ovarian cancer . However , the role of HER-2 in the development of ovarian cancer has not been sufficiently elucidated . The objective of this study was to determine the role of HER-2 in the apoptosis and metastasis of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells . SKOV-3 cells were transfected with three double‑stranded small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecules that target HER-2 . Various sequences were synthesized by T7 transcription invitro to select the most effective HER-2‑silencing siRNA . SKOV-3 cells were examined for growth inhibition using the MTT proliferation assay and apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay . The Matrigel basement memebrane matrix was used to assess invasion and chemotactic mobility , as a model of tumor cell metastasis . Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of matrix metallopeptidase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , E-cadherin , N-cadherin and vimentin. siRNA interference in HER-2 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and invasion and increased apoptosis . Western blot analysis demonstrated a marked increase in E-cadherin and MMP-9 and a reduction in N-cadherin and vimentin protein levels in the SKOV-3 cells . The suppression of HER-2 expression resulted in apoptosis and the inhibition of metastasis of SKOV-3 cells . Therefore , the overexpression of the HER-2 gene can enhance the metastatic potential of SKOV-3 cells by increasing the protein levels of MMP-9 . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition may be involved in the HER-2 siRNA-induced invasion and migration of SKOV-3 cells . Taken together , these results suggest that HER-2 functions as an oncogene and may thus be an attractive therapeutic target in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells .	12	1	9	8	93	81
We have recently developed surface-shielded transferrin-polyethylenimine ( Tf-PEI)/DNA delivery systems that target reporter gene expression to distant tumors after systemic application . In the present study , we used surface-shielded Tf-PEI/DNA complexes for delivering the gene for a highly potent cytokine , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) . TNFalpha is known for its ability to induce hemorrhagic tumor necrosis and tumor regression . However , the therapeutic application of TNFalpha is hampered by its high systemic toxicity dictating the need to target TNFalpha activity to the tumor . Systemic application of surface-shielded Tf-PEI complexes with the TNFalpha gene resulted in preferential expression of TNFalpha in the tumor without detectable TNFalpha serum levels , in contrast to the application of nontargeted complexes . Tumor-targeted TNFalpha gene delivery induced pronounced hemorrhagic tumor necrosis and inhibition of tumor growth in three murine tumor models of different tissue origins , Neuro2a neuroblastoma , MethA fibrosarcoma , and M-3 melanoma , with complete tumor regressions observed in the MethA model . No systemic TNF-related toxicity was observed due to the localization of the TNFalpha activity to the tumor . Targeted gene therapy may be an attractive strategy applicable to highly active , yet toxic , molecules such as TNFalpha .	83	8
Angiogenesis is essential for the growth , expansion and metastasis of human colorectal cancers ( CRCs ) . Histamine produced by mast cells is a potent proangiogenic factor . However , the significance of non-mast cell expressing histamine in the tumor microenvironment remains unknown . In this study , we evaluated the histamine positive microvessels with the specific marker for biosynthesis of histamine L-histidine decarboxylase ( HDC ) in the CRC tumor microenvironment . The relationship between HDC positive microvessel density ( HDC-MVD ) and clinical pathological parameters was assessed . The results revealed that HDC-MVD in the tumor microenvironment of CRCs was significantly increased as compared with the controls . CRC patients with lymph node invasion had a particularly higher density of HDC-MVD than those without . The density of HDC-MVD accounted for of CD34 positive MVD in CRCs and double IHC analysis demonstrated that these HDC positive microvessels were mostly CD34 positive microvessels and with a high proliferative activity . Our results suggest that histamine expressed in microvessels could be an additional cellular source and involved in the cancer invasion through promoting angiogenesis in human CRCs .	
Transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) exerts potent immunosuppressive effects . In this study , we investigated the potential role of TGF-beta1 produced by hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell lines in immunosuppression mechanisms . Using the Mv1Lu cell-growth inhibition assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , we detected optimal levels of TGF-beta1 in the culture supernatants conditioned by the HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/5 , Hep3B , and HepG2 . To determine the biological activity of TGF-beta1 in the supernatants , we examined the effects of the culture supernatants on the production of interferon ( IFN)-gamma induced during the culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) stimulated with interleukin ( IL)-12 . IFN-gamma production of IL-12-stimulated PBMCs in the 1:1 dilution of the acid-activated conditioned medium of PLC/PRF/5 , Hep3B , and HepG2 reduced to 14.7 +/- 0.8 , 17.3 +/- 9.0 , and 35.9 +/- 14.6% , respectively , compared with the value in the culture with control medium ( complete culture medium ) . These results suggest that HCC cells producing TGF-beta1 may reduce the generation or activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) and natural killer ( NK ) cells , and thus could enhance their ability to escape immune-mediated surveillance .	2	21
BACKGROUND The uneven distribution of recombination across the length of chromosomes results in inaccurate estimates of genetic to physical distances . In wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) chromosome 3B , it has been estimated that 90% of the cross over events occur in distal sub-telomeric regions representing 40% of the chromosome . Radiation hybrid ( RH ) mapping which does not rely on recombination is a strategy to map genomes and has been widely employed in animal species and more recently in some plants . RH maps have been proposed to provide i ) higher and ii ) more uniform resolution than genetic maps , and iii ) to be independent of the distribution patterns observed for meiotic recombination . An in vivo RH panel was generated for mapping chromosome 3B of wheat in an attempt to provide a complete scaffold for this Gb segment of the genome and compare the resolution to previous genetic maps . RESULTS A high density RH map with 541 marker loci anchored to chromosome 3B spanning a total distance of 1871.9 cR was generated . Detailed comparisons with a genetic map of similar quality confirmed that i ) the overall resolution of the RH map was 10.5 fold higher and ii ) six fold more uniform . A significant interaction ( r = 0.879 at p = 0.01 ) was observed between the DNA repair mechanism and the distribution of crossing-over events . This observation could be explained by accepting the possibility that the DNA repair mechanism in somatic cells is affected by the chromatin state in a way similar to the effect that chromatin state has on recombination frequencies in gametic cells . CONCLUSIONS The RH data presented here support for the first time in vivo the hypothesis of non-casual interaction between recombination hot-spots and DNA repair . Further , two major hypotheses are presented on how chromatin compactness could affect the DNA repair mechanism . Since the initial RH application 37 years ago , we were able to show for the first time that the iii ) third hypothesis of RH mapping might not be entirely correct .	
Cellular senescence is considered as a tumor suppressive mechanism . Recent evidence indicates however that senescent cells secrete various growth factors and cytokines , some of which may paradoxically promote cancer progression . This phenomenon termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) must be inhibited in order for anti-proliferative agents to be effective . The present study was designed to determine whether the β-catenin destruction complex ( BCDC ) , known to integrate the action of various growth factors and cytokines , would represent a suitable target to inhibit the activity of SASP components . For this , we carried out experiments to determine the effect of drug-induced senescence on secretion of SASP , β-catenin transactivation , and the relationship between these processes . Moreover , genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to define the implication of BCDC in mediating the effects of SASP components on cell migration and resistance to drugs . The findings indicate that drug-induced senescence was associated with expression of various Wnt ligands in addition to previously known SASP components . Beta catenin transactivation and expression of genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) also increased in response to drug-induced SASP . These effects were prevented by Pyrvinium , a recently described activator of BCDC . Pyrvinium also suppressed the effects of SASP on cell migration and resistance to doxorubicin . Together , these findings provide insights on the potential role of BCDC in mediating the effects of drug-induced SASP on cancer cell invasion and resistance to therapy , and suggest that targeting this pathway may represent an effective approach to enhance the activity of current and prospective anti-cancer therapeutics .	11	1	42	4
Previously , stereoselective hydroxylation of \u03b1-ionone by Cytochrome P450 BM3 mutants M01 A82W and M11 L437N was observed . While both mutants hydroxylate \u03b1-ionone in a regioselective manner at the C3 position , M01 A82W catalyzes formation of trans-3-OH-\u03b1-ionone products whereas M11 L437N exhibits opposite stereoselectivity , producing trans-(3S,6S)-OH-\u03b1-ionone and cis-(3S,6R)-OH-\u03b1-ionone . Here , we explore the stereoselective C3 hydroxylation of \u03b1-ionone by Cytochrome P450 BM3 mutants M01 A82W and M11 L437N using molecular dynamics-based free energy calculations to study the interaction between the enzyme and both the substrates and the products . The one-step perturbation approach is applied using an optimized reference state for substrates and products . While the free energy differences between the substrates free in solution amount to kJ mol(-1) , the differences in mutant M01 A82W agree with the experimentally obtained dissociation constants K(d) . Moreover , a correlation with experimentally observed trends in product formation is found in both mutants . The trans isomers show the most favorable relative binding free energy in the range of all four possible hydroxylated diastereomers for mutant M01 A82W , while the trans product from ( 6S)-\u03b1-ionone and the cis product from ( 6R)-\u03b1-ionone show highest affinity for mutant M11 L437N . Marcus theory is subsequently used to relate the thermodynamic stability to transition state energies and rates of formation .	
Chromosomal DNA must be in single-strand form for important transactions such as replication , transcription , and recombination to occur . The single-strand DNA ( ssDNA ) is more prone to damage than double-strand DNA ( dsDNA ) , due to greater exposure of chemically reactive moieties in the nitrogenous bases . Thus , there can be agents that damage regions of ssDNA in vivo while being inert toward dsDNA . To assess the potential hazard posed by such agents , we devised an ssDNA-specific mutagenesis reporter system in budding yeast . The reporter strains bear the cdc13-1 temperature-sensitive mutation , such that shifting to 37°C results in telomere uncapping and ensuing 5 ' to 3 ' enzymatic resection . This exposes the reporter region , containing three closely-spaced reporter genes , as a long 3 ' ssDNA overhang . We validated the ability of the system to detect mutagenic damage within ssDNA by expressing a modified human single-strand specific cytosine deaminase , APOBEC3G . APOBEC3G induced a high density of substitutions at cytosines in the ssDNA overhang strand , resulting in frequent , simultaneous inactivation of two reporter genes . We then examined the mutagenicity of sulfites , a class of reactive sulfur oxides to which humans are exposed frequently via respiration and food intake . Sulfites , at a concentration similar to that found in some foods , induced a high density of mutations , almost always as substitutions at cytosines in the ssDNA overhang strand , resulting in simultaneous inactivation of at least two reporter genes . Furthermore , sulfites formed a long-lived adducted 2'-deoxyuracil intermediate in DNA that was resistant to excision by uracil-DNA N-glycosylase . This intermediate was bypassed by error-prone translesion DNA synthesis , frequently involving Pol \u03b6 , during repair synthesis . Our results suggest that sulfite-induced lesions in DNA can be particularly deleterious , since cells might not possess the means to repair or bypass such lesions accurately .	611	61	62	63	6
The purpose of this study was to use the proteomics approach , which is based on high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with multivariate correspondence analysis and mass spectrometry , to classify objectively the biochemical basis of the anti-cancer activity of the synthetic cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , bohemine ( BOH ) . The changes in the cell cycle and corresponding protein composition of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line after treatment with BOH were evaluated and proteins differentially expressed in the BOH treated A549 cells , compared to the untreated A549 counterparts , were selected . Thirteen of these candidate proteins associated with the drug effects in vitro were identified by mass spectrometry . Many of these proteins fall into one of three functional categories : i ) metabolic pathways ( glycolysis , nucleic acid synthesis and NADPH production ) , ii ) stress response and protein folding , and iii ) cytoskeleton and exocytosis . Changes in protein expression patterns corresponded to a higher resistance of A549 lung carcinoma cells to BOH when compared to the CEM leukaemia cell line . These protein changes reflect a fine balance of the resistant versus the susceptible phenotype in response to the drug . Since BOH is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , changes in the protein expression pattern can be more generally associated with cell cycle regulation as evidenced by inhibition of cell cycling in A549 cells . Our conclusions further underline the importance of cell cycle control in both the cellular signalling and metabolic pathways .	511	5	51
BACKGROUND Advancing age is associated with substantial increases in the incidence rates of common diseases affecting the prostate gland including benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) and prostate carcinoma . The prostate is comprised of a functional secretory epithelium , a basal epithelium , and a supporting stroma comprised of structural elements , and a spectrum of cell types that includes smooth muscle cells , fibroblasts , and inflammatory cells . As reciprocal interactions between epithelium and stromal constituents are essential for normal organogenesis and serve to maintain normal functions , discordance within the stroma could permit or promote disease processes . In this study we sought to identify aging-associated alterations in the mouse prostate microenvironment that could influence pathology . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We quantitated transcript levels in microdissected glandular-adjacent stroma from young ( age 4 months ) and old ( age 20-24 months ) C57BL/6 mice , and identified a significant change in the expression of 1259 genes ( p<0.05 ) . These included increases in transcripts encoding proteins associated with inflammation ( e.g. , Ccl8 , Ccl12 ) , genotoxic/oxidative stress ( e.g. , Apod , Serpinb5 ) and other paracrine-acting effects ( e.g. , Cyr61 ) . The expression of several collagen genes ( e.g. , Col1a1 and Col3a1 ) exhibited age-associated declines . By histology , immunofluorescence , and electron microscopy we determined that the collagen matrix is abundant and disorganized , smooth muscle cell orientation is disordered , and inflammatory infiltrates are significantly increased , and are comprised of macrophages , T cells and , to a lesser extent , B cells . CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE These findings demonstrate that during normal aging the prostate stroma exhibits phenotypic and molecular characteristics plausibly contributing to the striking age associated pathologies affecting the prostate .	a21	a2	a
BACKGROUND Special AT-rich binding protein-1 ( SATB1 ) reprograms chromatin organization and transcription profiles to promote tumour growth and metastasis . AIMS This study aimed to confirm the effects of SATB1 on the growth and metastasis of liver cancer and its specific regulation mechanism . METHODS SATB1 expression was evaluated in human hepatoma tissue , adjacent noncancerous tissue and seven kinds of liver cancer cell lines . Cell cycle , cell proliferation , apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) was investigated after enhanced or silenced expression of SATB1 . The regulatory action of SATB1 on the expression of genes that are known to regulate cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT and the specific apoptotic pathway on which it acts were further analysed . Nude mice that received subcutaneous implantation were used to study the effects of SATB1 on tumour growth in vivo . RESULTS Our data show that the high expression of SATB1 was observed in the human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue ( 26/45 ) and liver cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential . SATB1 upregulated CDK4 and downregulated p16 ( INK ) ( 4A ) to promote cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis by inhibiting the FADD-caspase-8-caspase-3 death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway . SATB1 also induced EMT concomitant with increased expression of Snail1 , Slug , Twist and vimentin and decreased expression of E-cadherin , tight junction protein ZO-1 and desmoplakin . SATB1 promoted the growth of tumour in vivo . CONCLUSION These data suggest that the SATB1 gene may play an important role in the development and progression of liver cancer by regulation of genes related to cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT .	11	12	51	9	1	511	5	91	8	81
INTRODUCTION The progressive growth of malignancies is accompanied by a decline in the immune response through mechanisms which are poorly understood . Apoptosis and induction of inflammation by tumor released cytokines as tumor escape mechanisms have been proposed to play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis . METHODS Expression of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) was analyzed in colorectal cancer specimen and the cancer cell line HT-29 by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR . TNF-α expression on protein and mRNA level were correlated with clinical characteristics and impact on survival . TNFR-1 was co-labelled with TNF-α and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in immunofluorescence double staining experiments . RESULTS 94% ( n=98/104 ) of the patients with CRC expressed TNF-α . High TNF-α expression was significantly associated with positive lymph node stage and recurrence of the tumor . Multivariate analysis revealed high TNF-α expression as an independent prognostic factor . Immunohistochemistry was correlated with RT-PCR results ( τ=0.794 ) . Immunofluorescence double staining experiments revealed increased TNFR-1 expression by CD8+ cells . CONCLUSIONS TNF-α expression by tumor cells may be an efficient immunological escape mechanism by inflammation-enhanced metastases and probably by induction of apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ immune cells resulting in a down regulation of the tumoral immune response . Our data support the role of tumor-derived TNF-α expression as an important promoter of tumoral immune escape mechanisms and malignant progression , and suggest that analysis on either protein ( immunohistochemistry ) or RNA level ( RT-PCR ) can be used effectively in this respect . Targeting TNF-α may be a promising option , especially in cases with high TNF-α expression and positive lymph node metastases .	a1	1	12	a
Radiotherapy is a useful component of treatment strategies for esophageal cancer . The role of autophagy in response to ionizing radiation was investigated in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells . Cell viability and clonogenic survival assay were used to evaluate the radiosensitivity of autophagy inhibitor ( 3-MA ) on esophageal squamous carcinoma cells . The percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle analysis were assessed by flow cytometry ; DAPI staining was used to detect apoptotic cells . The expression of beclin-1 and LC3 was measured using a Western blot . The ultrastructural analysis was under the electron microscope. 6 Gy irradiation induced a massive accumulation of autophagosomes accompanied by strong upregulation of beclin-1 and LC3-II expression in TE-1 cells . Compared with radiation alone , 3-MA combined with radiation significantly decreased cell viability , as well as autophagic ratio , beclin-1 , and LC3-II protein level . Inhibition of autophagy increased radiation-induced apoptosis and the percentage of G2/M-phase cells . Blockade of autophagy with 3-MA enhanced cytotoxicity of radiotherapy in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells . It suggests that inhibition of autophagy could be used as adjuvant therapy to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .	82	81	8
Hypoxia has long been linked to the Warburg effect , yet the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear . It is also not known if lncRNAs are involved in the contribution of hypoxia to the Warburg effect . Here we show that lincRNA-p21 is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA and is essential for hypoxia-enhanced glycolysis . Hypoxia/HIF-1\u03b1-induced lincRNA-p21 is able to bind HIF-1\u03b1 and VHL and thus disrupts the VHL-HIF-1\u03b1 interaction . This disassociation attenuates VHL-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 ubiquitination and causes HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation . These data indicate the existence of a positive feedback loop between HIF-1\u03b1 and lincRNA-p21 that promotes glycolysis under hypoxia . The ability of lincRNA-p21 to promote tumor growth is validated in mouse xenograft models . Together , these findings suggest that lincRNA-p21 is an important player in the regulation of the Warburg effect and also implicate lincRNA-p21 as a valuable therapeutic target for cancer .	31	3
Purpose of this work was to synthesize several cis-/trans- isomer pairs of the platinum(II) complexes , and study the extent and the mode of their antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells . Six platinum(II) isomer pairs have a general formula cis-/trans-[PtA2X2] , where A is ligand : ammonia ( NH3 ) , pyridine ( Py ) ; and X is ligand : chloride ion ( Cl- ) , bromide ion ( Br- ) , iodide ion ( I- ) , thiocyanato ion ( SCN- ) ; four compounds have different structural formulas , and these are cis-/trans-[Pt(NH2OH)2(NH3)2]Cl2 , and cis-/trans-Pt(Gly)2 , where Gly is bidentate glycinato ligand . Results of the MTT assay , showed that six cis- and one trans-platinum(II) complexes exhibited cytotoxicity ( IC50 ) ranging between 5 and 33 microM . Most of the cis-platinum(II) isomers caused significant alteration of cell cycle phases progression , and induced apoptosis in degree that varied among different compounds , as evaluated using flowcytometry and morphological study . Spectrophotometric analysis ( AAS ) indicated that there is no correlation between intracellular platinum(II) accumulation and cytotoxicity of tested complexes .	91	81	9	8
Cellular senescence forms a barrier that inhibits the acquisition of an immortal phenotype , a critical feature in tumorigenesis . The inactivation of multiple pathways that positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization . To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner , we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of 20,000 genes in human prostate epithelial cells ( HPECs ) passaged to senescence . These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the human Papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein . Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative , differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components . A comparison of genes transcriptionally up-regulated in senescence to those in which expression is significantly down-regulated in immortalized HPECs identified three genes : the chemokine BRAK , DOC1 , and a member of the insulin-like growth factor axis , IGFBP-3 . Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts , and previously , their inactivation was documented in tumor samples . Thus , these genes may function in novel pathways that regulate senescence and are inactivated during immortalization . These changes may be critical not only in allowing cells to bypass senescence in vitro but in the progression of prostate cancer in vivo .	42	4	41
BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among US men . Epidemiological evidence suggests that high vitamin D status protects men from prostate cancer and the active form of vitamin D , 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D ) has anti-cancer effects in cultured prostate cells . Still , the molecular mechanisms and the gene targets for vitamin D-mediated prostate cancer prevention are unknown . RESULTS We examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D ( +/- 100 nM , 6 , 24 , 48 h ) on the transcript profile of proliferating RWPE1 cells , an immortalized , non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line that is growth arrested by 1,25(OH)2D ( Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 , n = 4/treatment per time and dose ) . Our analysis revealed many transcript level changes at a 5% false detection rate : 6 h , 1571 ( 61% up ) , 24 h , 1816 ( 60% up ) , 48 h , 3566 ( 38% up). 288 transcripts were regulated similarly at all time points ( 182 up , 80 down ) and many of the promoters for these transcripts contained putative vitamin D response elements . Functional analysis by pathway or Gene Set Analysis revealed early suppression of WNT , Notch , NF-kB , and IGF1 signaling . Transcripts related to inflammation were suppressed at 6 h ( e.g . IL-1 pathway ) and suppression of proinflammatory pathways continued at later time points ( e.g . IL-17 and IL-6 pathways ) . There was also evidence for induction of anti-angiogenic pathways and induction of transcripts for protection from oxidative stress or maintenance of cell redox homeostasis at 6 h . CONCLUSIONS Our data reveal of large number of potential new , direct vitamin D target genes relevant to prostate cancer prevention . In addition , our data suggests that rather than having a single strong regulatory effect , vitamin D orchestrates a pattern of changes within prostate epithelial cells that limit or slow carcinogenesis .	a21	7	a2	a	71
Rhabdoid tumors have been reported in many different anatomic sites as an aggressive tumor and usually present with a rhabdoid tumor component ( a composite tumor ) rather than a pure rhabdoid tumor . Rhabdoid tumor in the prostate has been described only once in the prostatic region as a possible epithelial origin . Rhabdoid features in prostatic stromal sarcomas ( PSSs ) have never been described in the literature . Here , we report a case of a PSS with rhabdoid features . A 31-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of voiding difficulty and anal pain . Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an ovoid mass in the prostate invading rectum and urinary bladder . A needle biopsy was diagnosed as an unclassified spindle cell sarcoma , and 2 cycles of adriamycin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were given , followed by radical prostatectomy . The prostatectomy specimen revealed a high-grade sarcoma with fascicles of highly cellular spindle cells and numerous mitoses with hemorrhage and necrosis . In areas , the tumor also contained sheets of loosely cohesive epithelioid cells with rhabdoid tumor component . Both spindle and rhabdoid tumor cells were positive for vimentin , CD34 , and progesterone receptor and negative for desmin and cytokeratin immunostainings . The rhabdoid tumor cells retained INI1 expression . The tumor recurred in the bladder , and the patient died of sepsis . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of PSS with rhabdoid features . The tumor showed an aggressive clinical behavior with a short-term survival ( 7 months after diagnosis ) .	83	8
Bisphosphonates ( BPs ) are the current standard of care for bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) but they are associated with a number of side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw . The exact mechanisms of osteonecrosis are not elucidated , and its physiopathology is based on several hypotheses such as a decrease in bone remodeling or an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis . The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis . We examined the apoptosis of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in MM subjects before and after BP treatment and in osteonecrosis patients using a flow-cytometric analysis . Our data showed an increase in endothelial cell apoptosis in MM patients after BP administration and in osteonecrosis subjects . Our study seems in agreement with the hypothesis that BPs can inhibit angiogenesis interfering with endothelial cell proliferation and survival , leading to loss of blood vessels and avascular necrosis .	83	7	71	8
PURPOSE Current antibody-based immunotherapeutic approaches under evaluation for breast carcinoma are limited in target scope . For example , administration of the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic drug , is thought to primarily inhibit tumor cell proliferation . The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a combined blockade designed to inhibit tumor growth by inhibition of proliferation rate and the proinflammatory effects of interleukin ( IL ) 8 . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A human breast carcinoma cell line that produces high levels of IL-8 was injected s.c. into severe combined immunodeficient mice . IL-8 has been reported to augment the progression of some human tumors ; thus , we used a human IL-8 antibody , ABXIL8 , in combination with anti-EGFR , ABXEGFR , to inhibit the metastasis of MDA231 tumors . RESULTS Whereas anti-IL-8 alone had no appreciable antimetastatic effect , the combination of ABXIL8 significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of ABXEGFR , resulting in greater survival of SCID tumor-bearing mice . This effect on survival was correlated with decreased metastatic spread and decreased tumor size in mice receiving both antibodies . Intriguingly , in vitro studies indicate that this antibody combination markedly inhibited matrix metalloproteinase activity associated with MDA-231 cells to a greater degree than either antibody alone . CONCLUSION Combined administration of these two human antibodies using growth factor blockade in conjunction with chemokine blockade may thus provide a more effective approach for treatment of metastatic human breast carcinoma .	1	12
Previous reports showed that treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents ( NSAIA ) can alter the growth profile of a variety of tumours . In this study , the effect of NSAIA treatment on the growth of the primary tumour and the appearance of spontaneous pulmonary metastases , was investigated . A mammary adenocarcinoma of non-detected immunogenicity , C7HI , was grafted subcutaneously in the lateral flank of Balb/c mice . Oral treatment with approximately 1 mg kg-1 day-1 piroxicam delayed both tumour growth and the growth of pulmonary metastases . Survival of mice bearing the primary tumour was significantly lengthened by anti-inflammatory treatment . Similarly , in separate experiments , after surgical removal of the primary tumour by day 34 after grafting , the group of mice treated orally with piroxicam also exhibited a higher survival rate than the control group . Upon surgical removal of the primary tumour 34 days after grafting , piroxicam treatment significantly decreased both the number and size of pulmonary metastases . The results of this study lends support to the hypothesis that inhibition or modulation of inflammation may delay tumour organisation and growth . It is suggested that piroxicam treatment may be an appropriate adjunct therapy to delay the appearance of pulmonary metastases and to increase life-expectancy in a host whose primary tumour has to be surgically removed .	1	12	a	a2
Human fibroblasts undergo cellular senescence after a finite number of divisions , in response to the erosion of telomeres . In addition to being terminally arrested in the cell cycle , senescent fibroblasts express genes that are normally induced upon wounding , including genes that remodel the extracellular matrix . We have identified the novel zinc finger protein APA-1 , whose expression increased in senescent human fibroblasts independent of telomere shortening . Extended passage , telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts had increased levels of APA-1 as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 . In fibroblasts , APA-1 was modified by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 , which increased APA-1 half-life , possibly by blocking ubiquitin-mediated degradation . Overexpression of APA-1 did not cause cell cycle arrest ; but , it induced transcription of the extracellular matrix-remodeling genes MMP1 and PAI2 , which are associated with fibroblast senescence . MMP1 and PAI2 transcript levels also increased in telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts that had high levels of APA-1 , demonstrating that the matrix-remodeling phenotype of senescent fibroblasts was not induced by telomere attrition alone . APA-1 was able to transactivate and bind to the MMP1 promoter , suggesting that APA-1 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of matrix-remodeling genes during fibroblast senescence .	91	9	42	4
BACKGROUND The Mutyh DNA glycosylase is involved in the repair of oxidized DNA bases . Mutations in the human MUTYH gene are responsible for colorectal cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis . Since defective DNA repair genes might contribute to the increased cancer risk associated with inflammatory bowel diseases , we compared the inflammatory response of wild-type and Mutyh(-/-) mice to oxidative stress . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The severity of colitis , changes in expression of genes involved in DNA repair and inflammation , DNA 8-oxoguanine levels and microsatellite instability were analysed in colon of mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) . The Mutyh(-/-) phenotype was associated with a significant accumulation of 8-oxoguanine in colon DNA of treated mice . A single DSS cycle induced severe acute ulcerative colitis in wild-type mice , whereas lesions were modest in Mutyh(-/-) mice , and this was associated with moderate variations in the expression of several cytokines . Eight DSS cycles caused chronic colitis in both wild-type and Mutyh(-/-) mice . Lymphoid hyperplasia and a significant reduction in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells were observed only in Mutyh(-/-) mice . CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that , in this model of ulcerative colitis , Mutyh plays a major role in maintaining intestinal integrity by affecting the inflammatory response .	a21	61	62	a2	a	6
This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which the human lung cancer drug resistance-related gene BC006151 regulates chemosensitivity by down-regulating BC006151 expression via antisense gene transfer in H446/(C)DDP cells . A retroviral vector containing the antisense BC006151 sequence was constructed and transfected into H446/(C)DDP cells . Transfection of the empty vector served as a negative control . The two groups of transfected cells were treated with various chemotherapeutic agents , after which morphological changes in cell ultrastructure were compared by transmission electron microscopy , cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to particular chemotherapeutic agents were compared by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method , the effects of chemotherapy on cell cycle and apoptosis were compared by flow cytometry , and Bcl-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis . Results showed that apoptotic body-like structures were identified by transmission electron microscopy in the antisense gene-transfected cells . MTT founded that these cells exhibited a significantly lower level of proliferation than the control cells ( p<0.01 ) , together with a markedly increased sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents ( p<0.01 ) . Flow cytometry analysis revealed that a G1 phase arrest accounted for the reduction in proliferation in the antisense gene-transfected cells ; increased apoptosis was also detected ( p<0.01 ) . Both immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis confirmed that Bcl-2 expression was significantly down-regulated in the antisense gene-transfected cells compared to controls . In a word , down-regulation of BC006151 can significantly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis of H446/(C)DDP cells after chemotherapy , and this gene may play an important role in the development of multidrug resistance in lung cancer .	51	5	511	8	81
Certain steroidal compounds have demonstrated an antiproliferative effect against several tumor cell lines ; however , their complete role on cancer cells is not currently established . Herein , we report the synthesis and evaluation of two new 26-hydroxy-22-oxocholestanic steroids on cervical cancer CaSki cells . The title compounds were prepared from diosgenin and hecogenin in excellent yields . We determined their effect on cell proliferation , cell cycle , and cell death . The cytotoxic effect of the title compounds on CaSki and human lymphocytes was also evaluated , indicating that the main cell death process is not necrosis ; the null effect on lymphocytes implies that they are not cytotoxic . The observation of apoptotic bodies as well as the increase in the expression of active caspase-3 along with the fragmentation of DNA confirmed that such new cholestanic frameworks induced apoptosis in tumor cells . Significantly , their antiproliferative activity on tumor cells did not affect the proliferative potential of normal fibroblasts from cervix and peripheral blood lymphocytes . The title compounds show selective antitumor activity and therefore serve as promising lead candidates for further optimization .	83	81	8
BACKGROUND Thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) promotes breast cancer cell invasion of collagen by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) production . Stromal TSP-1 may play a role in regulating tumor cell invasion . We hypothesize that fibroblasts promote breast cancer cell invasion by upregulating the production of MMP-9 through TSP-1 . METHODS MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were grown alone or in coculture with human fibroblasts . Gelatin zymography and Western immunoblot analysis for MMP-9 were performed on the coculture cell media and the single cell media . Inhibition of fibroblast-mediated breast tumor cell invasion by an anti-TSP-1 or an anti-MMP-9 antibody was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber . RESULTS Coculture experiments showed an increased production of MMP-9 when compared with breast cancer single cell culture or fibroblast single cell culture experiments as demonstrated by zymography and Western immunoblot analysis . Fibroblast-stimulated MMP-9 production was comparable with TSP-1-stimulated MMP-9 production . Anti-TSP-1 antibody and anti-MMP-9 antibody inhibited fibroblast-stimulated tumor cell invasion to 30% and 26% of controls , respectively ( P <.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Fibroblasts may regulate breast cancer cell invasion by promoting tumor MMP-9 production through TSP-1 . Inhibition of stromal TSP-1 stimulation of MMP-9 synthesis may prevent matrix degradation necessary for tumor invasion and metastasis .	1	11
Prenatal mortality is a prime concern for commercial swine industry in North America . Fetal losses occur throughout gestation but cluster in early ( and mid ( pregnancy . Adequate vascularization of the attachment site has emerged as a key factor contributing to fetal success . Since Insulin-Like Growth Factor ( IGF ) family members regulate angiogenesis in addition to promoting fetal development and growth , we hypothesized that conceptus success is governed by members of the IGF family . Using quantitative real time PCR , we analyzed expression of IGF family members ( IGF-I , IGF-II , IGF-I Receptor ( IGF-IR ) , IGF-IIR and their binding proteins , IGFBPs ) in matched maternal and fetal tissues of healthy and arresting conceptuses at gestation days ( gd ) 20 and 50 . IGF-II transcripts were 100 fold increased in both maternal and fetal tissues compared to IGF-I , but receptor transcripts were found in similar abundance irrespective of health status and gestation point . IGFBP3 was the most abundantly transcribed of the binding proteins . Using immunohistochemistry we confirmed the expression of IGF family members in maternal luminal and glandular epithelial cells , the endothelium of blood vessels and some scattered stromal cells . Our results suggest that IGF-I and II and their receptors are differentially expressed at the maternal and fetal components of the attachment site .	
We show that sufficient concentrations of gold nanoparticles produced by an original synthesis method in EMT-6 and CT-26 cancer cells make it possible to detect the presence , necrosis and proliferation of such cells after inoculation in live mice . We first demonstrated that the nanoparticles do not interfere with the proliferation process . Then , we observed significant differences in the tumor evolution and the angiogenesis process after shallow and deep inoculation . A direct comparison with pathology optical images illustrates the effectiveness of this approach .	9	7	71
Radiation-induced carcinogenesis is a major concern both for astronauts on long-term space missions and for cancer patients being treated with therapeutic radiation . Exposure to radiation induces oxidative stress and chronic inflammation , which are critical initiators and promoters of carcinogenesis . Many studies have demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antioxidants can reduce the risk of radiation-induced cancer . In this study , we found that a synthetic triterpenoid , CDDO-Me ( bardoxolone methyl ) , was able to protect human colon epithelial cells ( HCECs ) against radiation-induced transformation . HCECs that were immortalized by ectopic expression of hTERT and cdk4 and exhibit trisomy for chromosome 7 ( a non-random chromosome change that occurs in 37% of premalignant colon adenomas ) can be transformed experimentally with one combined exposure to 2 Gy of protons at 1 GeV/nucleon followed 24 h later by 50 cGy of ( 56)Fe ions at 1 GeV/nucleon . Transformed cells showed an increase in proliferation rate and in both anchorage-dependent and independent colony formation ability . A spectrum of chromosome aberrations was observed in transformed cells , with 40% showing loss of 17p ( e.g. loss of one copy of p53 ) . Pretreatment of cells with pharmacological doses of CDDO-Me , which has been shown to induce antioxidative as well as anti-inflammatory responses , prevented the heavy-ion-induced increase in proliferation rate and anchorage-dependent and independent colony formation efficiencies . Taken together , these results demonstrate that experimentally immortalized human colon epithelial cells with a non-random chromosome 7 trisomy are valuable premalignant cellular reagents that can be used to study radiation-induced colorectal carcinogenesis . The utility of premalignant HCECs to test novel compounds such as CDDO-Me that can be used to protect against radiation-induced neoplastic transformation is also demonstrated .	a21	a2	a	6
The Ras association domain family 1 isoform A ( RASSF1A ) is a tumor suppressor whose inactivation is implicated in the development of many human cancers , including breast carcinomas . Little is known about the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF1A in breast tissue and whether its inactivation is mechanistically involved in the initiation and progression of breast tumors . Here , we show that RASSF1A inhibits breast cancer growth in vivo , and suppresses estrogen receptor ( ERα ) expression and function . Reconstitution of RASSF1A in MCF7 cells led to decreased ERα levels and reduced sensitivity to estrogen ( E2 ) . Concomitantly , we observed decreased expression of Id1 as well as the E2-responsive genes Bcl-2 and c-Myc that cooperatively contribute to the immortalization and transformation of breast epithelial cells . This downregulation was associated with induction of cell-cycle arrest and senescence that constitute early barriers to cancer initiation and progression . Knockdown of ERα showed that downregulation of ERα suffices to increase senescence and inhibit expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 . However , enforced expression of ERα only partially rescued RASSF1A-mediated growth inhibition and senescence , suggesting that suppression of ERα expression and activity is not the only mechanism by which RASSF1A inhibits growth and survival of breast cancer cells . Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 had little or no effect on RASSF1A-mediated growth arrest , indicating that RASSF1A acts dominantly over these oncogenes . Mechanistically , RASSF1A was found to suppress ERα expression through Akt1 . It also transiently inhibited ERα-induced Ras-MAPK activity after exposure of cells to E2 . Together , our data show that RASSF1A acts as a tumor suppressor in ERα+ mammary epithelial cells , in part through inhibiting ERα expression and activity . These findings suggest that RASSF1A has a key role in suppressing the transformation of human breast epithelial cells and ERα+ breast cancer initiation .	42	41	9	4	91	93
Vitexicarpin ( 3 ' , 5-dihydroxy-3 , 4 ' , 6 , 7-tetramethoxyflavone ) , a polymethoxyflavone isolated from Viticis Fructus ( Vitex rotundifolia Linne fil. ) , has long been used as an anti-inflammatory herb in traditional Chinese medicine . It has also been reported that vitexicarpin can inhibit the growth of various cancer cells . However , there is no report elucidating its effect on human prostate carcinoma cells . The aim of the present study was to examine the apoptotic induction activity of vitexicarpin on PC-3 cells and molecular mechanisms involved . MTT studies showed that vitexicarpin dose-dependently inhibited growth of PC-3 cells with an IC50 μM . Hoechst 33258 staining further revealed that vitexicarpin induced apoptotic cell death . The effect of vitexicarpin on PC-3 cells apoptosis was tested using prodium iodide ( PI)/Annexin V-FITC double staining and flow cytometry . The results indicated that vitexicarpin induction of apoptotic cell death in PC-3 cells was accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase . Furthermore , our study demonstrated that vitexicarpin induction of PC-3 cell apoptosis was associated with upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax , and downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 , release of Cytochrome c from mitochondria and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential . Our findings suggested that vitexicarpin may become a potential leading drug in the therapy of prostate carcinoma .	
PURPOSE To investigate the in vitro release of octreotide acetate , a somatostatin agonist , from microspheres based on a hydrophilic polyester , poly(D,L-lactide-co-hydroxymethyl glycolide ) ( PLHMGA ) . METHODS Spherical and non-porous octreotide-loaded PLHMGA microspheres ( 12 to 16\u03bcm ) and loading efficiency of 60-70% were prepared by a solvent evaporation . Octreotide release profiles were compared with commercial PLGA formulation ( Sandostatin LAR(®) ) ; possible peptide modification with lactic , glycolic and hydroxymethyl glycolic acid units was monitored . RESULTS PLHMGA microspheres showed burst release ( followed by sustained release for 20-60days , depending on the hydrophilicity of the polymer . Percentage of released loaded peptide was high ( 70-90% ) ; >\u200960% of released peptide was native octreotide . PLGA microspheres did not show peptide release for the first 10days , after which it was released in a sustained manner over the next 90days ; >\u200975% of released peptides were acylated adducts . CONCLUSIONS PLHMGA microspheres are promising controlled systems for peptides with excellent control over release kinetics . Moreover , substantially less peptide modification occurred in PLHMGA than in PLGA microspheres .	
p24 proteins comprise a family of type-I transmembrane proteins of that are present in yeast and plants as well as metazoans ranging from Drosophila to humans . These proteins are most commonly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER)-Golgi interface and are incorporated in anterograde and retrograde transport vesicles . Little is known about how disruption of p24 signaling affects individual tissue function or whole animals . Drosophila melanogaster express nine p24 genes , grouped into four subfamilies . Based upon our mRNA and protein expression data , Drosophila p24 family members are expressed in a variety of tissues . To identify functions for particular Drosophila p24 proteins , we used RNA interference ( RNAi ) to reduce p24 expression . Ubiquitous reduction of most p24 genes resulted in complete or partial lethality during development . We found that reducing p24 levels in adults caused defects in female fecundity ( egg laying ) and also reduced male fertility . We attributed reduced female fecundity to decreased neural p24 expression . These results provide the first genetic analysis of all p24 family members in a multicellular animal and indicate vital roles for Drosophila p24s in development and reproduction , implicating neural expression of p24s in the regulation of female behavior .	
DNA repair enzymes play an important role in the development of various kinds of cancer . We here analyzed associations of XPD Lys751Gln , APEX1 Asp148Glu , XRCC1 Arg399Gln , and XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphisms in DNA repair pathways in relation to the risk of lung cancer using PCR-RFLP . The study involved 104 lung cancer patients and 120 non-cancer controls divided into non-smokers and smokers . We found a statistically significant interaction between APEX1 Asp148Glu and the risk for lung cancer ( adjusted OR 2.78 , 95% CI 1.58-4.90 , p=0.0004 ) , of both adenocarcinoma ( adjusted OR 2.24 , 95%CI 1.18-4.25 , p=0.014 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( adjusted OR 4.75 , 95%CI 1.79-12.6 , p=0.002 ) types . XRCC1 Arg399Gln showed a borderline significant association with adenocarcinoma ( adjusted OR 1.89 , 95%CI 1.00-3.57 , p=0.051 ) . The combined effect of smoking and presence of the APEX1 Asp148Glu demonstrated a significant association with risk of lung cancer ( adjusted OR 3.61 , 95% CI 1.74-7.50 , p=0.001 ) . The XPD Lys751Gln and XRCC3 Thr241Met genotypes displayed no statistically significant risk . Our findings suggest that the APEX1 Asp148Glu is associated with increased risk for primary lung cancer in Japanese individuals partaking in smoking .	62	6
The aim of this study was to determine whether isorhamnetin , an immediate 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin , affects proliferation , cell death , and the cell cycle of human colon carcinoma ( HCT-116 ) cells . Isorhamnetin was found to be a potent antiproliferative agent in a dose- and time-dependent manner , with an IC50 of 72 μM after 48 h of incubation as estimated by MTT assay . Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that isorhamnetin exerted a stimulatory effect on apoptosis and necrosis . Isorhamnetin also increased the number of cells in G2/M phase . Serum deprivation appeared to potentiate the effects of isorhamnetin on cell death and facilitated cell cycle progression to G0/G1 phase . These results suggest that isorhamnetin might mediate inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth through the perturbation of cell cycle progression and are consistent with the notion that G2/M checkpoints could be a conserved target for flavonoids in human colon cancer cells , leading to apoptotic and necrotic death . These antiproliferative , apoptotic , necrotic , and cell cycle effects suggest that isorhamnetin may have clinically significant therapeutic and chemopreventive capabilities . To our knowledge , this is the first report of the effect of isorhamnetin on human colon cancer cells .	9	51	511	5	8	91	83	81
Induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells share some basic properties , such as self-renewal and pluripotency , with cancer cells , and they also appear to share several metabolic alterations that are commonly observed in human tumors . The cancer cells ' glycolytic phenotype , first reported by Otto Warburg , is necessary for the optimal routing of somatic cells to pluripotency . However , how iPS cells establish a Warburg-like metabolic phenotype and whether the metabolic pathways that support the bioenergetics of iPS cells are produced by the same mechanisms that are selected during the tumorigenic process remain largely unexplored . We recently investigated whether the reprogramming-competent metabotype of iPS cells involves changes in the activation/expression status of the H ( + ) -ATPase , which is a core component of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation that is repressed at both the activity and protein levels in human carcinomas , and of the lipogenic switch , which refers to a marked overexpression and hyperactivity of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( ACACA ) and fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) lipogenic enzymes that has been observed in nearly all examined cancer types . A comparison of a starting population of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and their iPS cell progeny revealed that somatic cell reprogramming involves a significant increase in the expression of ATPase inhibitor factor 1 ( IF1 ) , accompanied by extremely low expression levels of the catalytic β-F1-ATPase subunit . The pharmacological inhibition of ACACA and FASN activities markedly decreases reprogramming efficiency , and ACACA and FASN expression are notably upregulated in iPS cells . Importantly , iPS cells exhibited a significant intracellular accumulation of neutral lipid bodies ; however , these bodies may be a reflection of intense lysosomal/autophagocytic activity rather than bona fide lipid droplet formation in iPS cells , as they were largely unresponsive to pharmacological modulation of PPARgamma and FASN activities . The AMPK agonist metformin , which endows somatic cells with a bioenergetic infrastructure that is protected against reprogramming , was found to drastically elongate fibroblast mitochondria , fully reverse the high IF1/β-F1-ATPase ratio and downregulate the ACACA/FASN lipogenic enzymes in iPS cells . The mitochondrial H ( + ) -ATP synthase and the ACACA/FASN-driven lipogenic switch are newly characterized as instrumental metabolic events that , by coupling the Warburg effect to anabolic metabolism , enable de-differentiation during the reprogramming of somatic cells to iPS cells .	31	3
One classical feature of cancer cells is their metabolic acquisition of a highly glycolytic phenotype . Carbon monoxide ( CO ) , one of the products of the cytoprotective molecule heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) in cancer cells , has been implicated in carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance . However , the functional contributions of CO and HO-1 to these processes are poorly defined . In human prostate cancers , we found that HO-1 was nuclear localized in malignant cells , with low enzymatic activity in moderately differentiated tumors correlating with relatively worse clinical outcomes . Exposure to CO sensitized prostate cancer cells but not normal cells to chemotherapy , with growth arrest and apoptosis induced in vivo in part through mitotic catastrophe . CO targeted mitochondria activity in cancer cells as evidenced by higher oxygen consumption , free radical generation , and mitochondrial collapse . Collectively , our findings indicated that CO transiently induces an anti-Warburg effect by rapidly fueling cancer cell bioenergetics , ultimately resulting in metabolic exhaustion .	8	31	81	3
Solar ultraviolet radiation is considered to be injurious rather than necessary for most organisms living on the earth . It is reported that the risk of skin cancer in humans increases by the depletion of the ozone layer . We have examined the genotoxicity of solar ultraviolet , especially the longer wavelength light , using Drosophila . Recently , we have demonstrated that light of wavelength up to 340 nm is mutagenic on Drosophila larvae . Using an excision repair-deficient Drosophila strain ( mus201 ) , we have obtained results suggesting that the lesion caused in larvae by the 320 nm-light irradiation may be similar to the damage induced by irradiation at 310 nm , and that light of 330 and 340 nm may induce damage different from that induced by 310 and 320 nm-light . To examine the difference in DNA damage induced by light of a particular wavelength , we performed monochromatic irradiation on larvae of two Drosophila strains ; one excision repair-deficient ( mei-9 ) and another postreplication repair-deficient ( mei-41). 310 and 320 nm-light was more mutagenic in the mei-9 strain than in mei-41 , whereas 330 and 340 nm-light was more mutagenic in mei-41 than in mei-9 . It is demonstrated that the mei-41 gene is a homologue of the human atm gene which is responsible for a cell cycle checkpoint . This result suggests that 310-320 nm-light induces DNA damage that is subject to nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and that 330-360 nm-light causes damage to be recognized by the cell cycle checkpoint but it is not repairable by NER .	51	61	62	5	6	511
BACKGROUND/AIMS Analysis of cystic fluid may be useful in distinguishing between benign and malignant cysts which has significant impact on their management . The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic utility of carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and K-ras gene mutation in pancreatic cysts fluid . METHODS The study included 56 patients with pancreatic cystic fluid collected for analysis . The cysts were classified as benign ( simple cysts , pseudocysts , serous cystadenoma ) - 39 patients or premalignant/malignant ( mucinous cystadenoma , IPMN , cystadenocarcinoma ) - 17 patients . The patients history , CEA fluid concentrations and presence of K-ras mutation were analyzed . RESULTS CEA were higher in patients with malignant cysts ( mean levels 238±12.5ng/ml ; range 32.8-4985ng/ml ) compared to benign lesions ( mean levels 34.5±3.7ng/ml ; range 3.9-693ng/ml ; p<0.001 ) . K-ras mutation correctly classified 11 of 17 patients with premalignant/malignant lesions . It was also detected in 1 patient with final diagnosis of benign cyst ( the sensitivity 64.7% and the specificity 97.4% ; p<0.01 ) . If CEA and molecular analysis were combined in that cysts with either CEA level>45ng/ml or presence of K-ras mutation , than 16 of 17 premalignant/malignant cysts were correctly identified ( 94.1% ) . CONCLUSION Molecular analysis of pancreatic cyst fluid adds diagnostic value to the preoperative diagnosis and should be considered when cyst cytologic examination is negative for malignancy .	63	6
Piceatannol has potent anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , anticancer and antiproliferative effects . However , little is known about the mechanism by which piceatannol inhibits invasion and metastasis . The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of piceatannol on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in DU145 human prostate cancer cells . The results revealed that MMP-9 activity was significantly increased in response to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 ( TNF-\u03b1 ) . However , treatment with piceatannol reversed TNF-\u03b1- and MMP-9-induced gelatin zymography and its gene expression . In addition , a Matrigel invasion assay determined that piceatannol reduces the TNF-\u03b1-induced invasion of DU145 cells . Nuclear factor-\u03ba B ( NF-\u03baB ) is a significant transcription factor that regulates numerous genes involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Therefore , whether piceatannol acts on NF-\u03baB to regulate MMP-9 gene expression was analyzed . The results revealed that piceatannol attenuates MMP-9 gene expression via the suppression of NF-\u03baB activity . Using a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , it was confirmed that TNF-\u03b1-induced MMP-9 gene expression is primarily regulated by NF-\u03baB activation . Piceatannol inhibited NF-\u03baB activity by suppressing nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB p65 and p50 subunits . Furthermore , TNF-\u03b1-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly downregulated in the presence of piceatannol . The Akt inhibitor LY294002 caused a significant decrease in TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activity and MMP-9 gene expression . Overall , these data suggest that piceatannol inhibits TNF-\u03b1-induced invasion by suppression of MMP-9 activation via the Akt-mediated NF-\u03baB pathway in DU145 prostate cancer cells .	11	1
The role of T cells in eradicating leukemic cells has been well demonstrated for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Type 1 ( T1 ) T-cell cytokines play a major role in this antileukemic immune effect . Studies in cancer patients have demonstrated a decreased T1 cytokine production , measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells . This observation of malignancy-related suppressed T1 cytokines also occurs in untreated chronic-phase ( CP ) CML , raising the question of the influence of different CML treatment regimens on this immunosuppression . Intracellular flow cytometry ( ICF ) has facilitated the evaluation of cytokines on a single-cell level . This study analyzed T1 ( interferon-gamma ) cytokine production in purified peripheral blood T cells by ICF , comparing different therapy approaches for CML . Twenty-one newly diagnosed CP CML patients were compared with 24 patients treated with interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) and to 30 allogeneic bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) recipients ( BCR-ABL negative by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , and free of , or having only limited graft-versus-host disease at the time of study ) . Thirty-seven healthy controls were included . Our results showed a significantly decreased T-cell IFN-gamma synthesis in CP CML patients in relation to healthy controls ( P = 0.0007 ) . Treatment with IFN-alpha resulted in a shift from immunosuppression--documented for the group of untreated patients--to immunopotentiation , with an increase of T-cell IFN-gamma production ( P = 0.0266 ) . Notably , BMT enhanced IFN-gamma production of T cells to a level not only exceeding untreated patients ( P < 0.0001 ) but also healthy volunteers ( P < 0.0001 ) . The observation of T1 cytokine up-regulation with IFN-alpha therapy indicates that enhanced T-cell function may be achievable in patients with CML , even in the absence of an allo-response .	2	22
The prediction of response or severe toxicity and therapy individualisation are extremely important in cancer chemotherapy . There are few tools to predict chemoresponse or toxicity in cancer patients . We investigated the correlation between the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) using constant-field gel electrophoresis ( CFGE ) and evaluating cell cycle progression and the sensitivity of four cancer cell lines to 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) . Using a sulphorhodamine-B assay , colon carcinoma cells ( HCT116 ) were found to be the most sensitive to 5FU , followed by liver carcinoma cells ( HepG2 ) and breast carcinoma cells ( MCF-7 ) . Cervical carcinoma cells ( HeLa ) were the most resistant . As measured by CFGE , DSB induction , but not residual DSBs , exhibited a significant correlation with the sensitivity of the cell lines to 5FU . Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis revealed that 14% of HCT116 or HepG2 cells and 2% of MCF-7 cells shifted to sub-G1 phase after a 96-h incubation with 5FU . Another 5FU-induced cell cycle change in HCT116 , HepG2 and MCF-7 cells was the mild arrest of cells in G1 and/or G2/M phases of the cell cycle . In addition , 5FU treatment resulted in the accumulation of HeLa cells in the S and G2/M phases . Determination of Fas ligand ( Fas-L ) and caspase 9 as representative markers for the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis , respectively , revealed that 5FU-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and HepG2 results from the expression of Fas-L ( extrinsic pathway ) . Therefore , the induction of DNA DSBs by 5FU , detected using CFGE , and the induction of apoptosis are candidate predictive markers that may distinguish cancer cells which are likely to benefit from 5FU treatment and the measurement of DSBs using CFGE may aid the prediction of clinical outcome .	61	612	51	511	9	5	6	91	8	81
INTRODUCTION The HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir is currently under investigation as a new anti-cancer drug . Several studies have shown that nelfinavir induces cell cycle arrest , endoplasmic reticulum stress , autophagy , and apoptosis in cancer cells . In the present article , the effect of nelfinavir on human breast cancer cells is examined and potential combination treatments are investigated . METHODS The effects of nelfinavir and tamoxifen on the human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 , T47 D , MDA-MB-453 , and MDA-MB-435 were tested by analysing their influence on cell viability ( via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay ) , apoptosis ( annexin binding , poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage ) , autophagy ( autophagy marker light chain 3B expression ) , endoplasmic reticulum stress ( binding protein and activating transcription factor 3 expression ) , and the occurrence of oxidative stress ( intracellular glutathione level ) . RESULTS Nelfinavir induced apoptosis in all four breast cancer cell lines tested , although the extent of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress varied among the cell lines . The concentration of nelfinavir needed for an efficient induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells could be reduced from 15 μg/ml to 6 μg/ml when combined with tamoxifen . At a concentration of 6 μg/ml , tamoxifen substantially enhanced the endoplasmic reticulum stress reaction in those cell lines that responded to nelfinavir with binding protein ( BiP ) upregulation ( MCF7 , T47D ) , and enhanced autophagy in cell lines that responded to nelfinavir treatment with autophagy marker light chain 3B upregulation ( MDA-MB-453 ) . Although tamoxifen has been described to be able to induce oxidative stress at concentrations similar to those applied in this study ( 6 μg/ml ) , we observed that nelfinavir but not tamoxifen reduced the intracellular glutathione level of breast cancer cells within hours of application by up to 32% , suggesting the induction of oxidative stress was an early event and an additional cause of the apoptosis induced by nelfinavir . CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that nelfinavir may be an effective drug against breast cancer and could be combined with tamoxifen to enhance its efficacy against breast cancer cells . Moreover , the cytotoxic effect of a tamoxifen and nelfinavir combination was independent of the oestrogen receptor status of the analysed breast cancer cells , suggesting a potential benefit of a combination of these two drugs even in patients with no hormone-responsive tumours . We therefore recommend that clinical studies on nelfinavir with breast cancer patients should include this drug combination to analyse the therapeutic efficacy as well as the safety and tolerability of this potential treatment option .	9	82	8	93	81
Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) , discovered in 2008 , is clonally integrated in Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) . MCV is a common skin flora and initiates cancer in susceptible hosts only after it acquires a precise set of mutations that render it replication incompetent . Both MCV large and small T proteins promote cancer cell survival and proliferation . Large T targets pocket proteins regulating cell cycle transit while small T activates cap-dependent translation critical for cancer cell growth . These findings already have led to new diagnostics and clinical trials to target MCV-induced survivin and to promote antitumor immunity . In four years , the cause , diagnosis and therapy for an intractable cancer has been changed due to the molecular discovery of MCV .	
Many human cellular and tissue compartments are supersaturated with respect to calcium oxyanion salts . In order to prevent the formation of injurious crystals efficient anti-crystallization protective mechanisms must be necessary . We suggest that depletion of such systems , particularly in ageing organisms and under conditions of oxidative stress , plays an important role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases , including cancer .	a21	a2	a
Cytochrome P450 2A6 ( CYP2A6 ) is known to metabolize nicotine , the major constituent of tobacco , leading to the production of toxic metabolites and induction of oxidative stress that result in liver damage and lung cancer . Recently , we have shown that CYP2A6 is induced by ethanol and metabolizes nicotine into cotinine and other metabolites leading to generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in U937 monocytes . However , the mechanism by which CYP2A6 is induced by ethanol is unknown . In this study , we have examined the role of the PKC/Nrf2 pathway ( protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation and translocation of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 to the nucleus ) in ethanol-mediated CYP2A6 induction . Our results showed that 100 mM ethanol significantly induced CYP2A6 mRNA and protein ( and increased ROS formation , and induction of gene expression and ROS were both completely blocked by treatment with either a CYP2E1 inhibitor ( diallyl sulfide ) or an antioxidant ( vitamin C ) . The results suggest the role of oxidative stress in the regulation of CYP2A6 expression . Subsequently , we investigated the role of Nrf2 pathway in oxidative stress-mediated regulation of CYP2A6 expression in U937 monocytes . Our results showed that butylated hydroxyanisole , a stabilizer of nuclear Nrf2 , increased CYP2A6 levels >200% . Staurosporine , an inhibitor of PKC , completely abolished ethanol-induced CYP2A6 expression . Furthermore , our results showed that a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) ( U0126 ) completely abolished ethanol-mediated CYP2A6 induction and Nrf2 translocation . Overall , these results suggest that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress produced as a result of ethanol metabolism translocates Nrf2 into the nucleus through PKC/MEK pathway , resulting in the induction of CYP2A6 in monocytes . An increased level of CYP2A6 in monocytes is expected to further increase oxidative stress in smokers through CYP2A6-mediated nicotine metabolism . Thus , this study has clinical relevance because of the high incidence of alcohol use among smokers , especially in HIV-infected individuals .	
UVB is a major cause of nonmelanoma skin cancer in humans . Photochemoprevention represents an important strategy in protecting the skin against the detrimental effects of ultraviolet B ( UVB ) . We investigated the activity of Calluna vulgaris ( Cv ) delivered via a hydrogel on 3 main pathways ( oxidative stress , inflammation , DNA damage ) on skin exposed to multiple doses of UVB in SKH-1 mice . Fifty female mice were divided randomly into 5 groups : control , vehicle , UVB irradiated , Cv + UVB irradiated , and Cv + vehicle + UVB irradiated . The extract was applied topically on the skin in a dose of 4 mg polyphenols/cm2 30 minutes before each UVB ( 240 mJ/cm2 ) exposure over 10 consecutive days . Malondialdehyde , reduced glutathione , tumor necrosis factor-α , interleukin-6 , cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( CPD ) levels , sunburn cell formation and epidermal thickness , and the number of epidermal cell layers in skin were evaluated 24 hours after the last treatment . UVB increased cytokine levels ( P < 0.001 ) , formation of CPDs ( P < 0.001 ) and sunburn cells ( P < 0.001 ) , and the epidermal thickness and number of epidermal cell layers ( P < 0.001 ) compared with the control group . The topical application of Cv protected the skin against inflammation and DNA damage , as shown by a decreased number of CPDs ( P < 0.001 ) and sunburn cells ( P < 0.001 ) . The administration of Cv via hydrogel may be a viable method for chemoprevention. .	61	a2	a	6
Stable ectopic expression of Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase is usually performed in interleukin 3 ( IL-3)-dependent murine cell lines like Ba/F3 , resulting in loss of IL-3 dependence . Such high-level Flt3 expression has to date not been reported in human acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell lines , despite the fact that oncogenic Flt3 aberrancies are frequent in AML patients . We show here that ectopic Flt3 expression in different human cancer cell lines might reduce proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death , involving Bax/Bcl2 modulation . Selective depletion of Flt3-expressing cells occurred in human AML cell lines transduced with retroviral Flt3 constructs , shown here using the HL-60 leukemic cell line . Flt3 expression was investigated in two cellular model systems , the SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line and the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line , and proliferation was reduced in both systems . HEK293 cells underwent apoptosis upon ectopic Flt3 expression and cell death could be rescued by overexpression of Bcl-2 . Furthermore , we observed that the Flt3-induced inhibition of proliferation in HL-60 cells appeared to be Bax-dependent . Our results thus suggest that excessive Flt3 expression has growth-suppressive properties in several human cancer cell lines .	9	81	8
Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can promote chemoresistance and metastatic spread in aggressive tumors . Consequently , the type and quality of immune responses present in the neoplastic stroma are highly predictive of patient outcome in several cancer types . In addition to host immune responses , intrinsic tumor cell activities that mimic stem cell properties have been linked to chemoresistance , metastatic dissemination and the induction of immune suppression . Cancer stem cells are far from a static cell population ; rather , their presence appears to be controlled by highly dynamic processes that are dependent on cues from the tumor stroma . However , the impact immune responses have on tumor stem cell differentiation or expansion is not well understood . In this study , we demonstrate that targeting tumor-infiltrating macrophages and inflammatory monocytes by inhibiting either the myeloid cell receptors CSF1R or CCR2 decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells in pancreatic tumors . Targeting CCR2 or CSF1R improves chemotherapeutic efficacy , inhibits metastasis and increases antitumor T-cell responses . Tumor-educated macrophages also directly enhanced the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic tumor cells by activating the transcription factor STAT3 , thereby facilitating macrophage-mediated suppression of CD8+ T lymphocytes . Together , our findings show how targeting tumor-infiltrating macrophages can effectively overcome therapeutic resistance mediated by tumor-initiating cells .	a	12	21	1	a2	2
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide ; however , the prognosis of HCC patients remains poor . This poor prognosis is mainly attributed to the high rate of intrahepatic and distant metastasis . HCC often occurs in a hypoxic environment and hypoxia can activate metastatic programs , ultimately leading to tumor recurrence or metastasis . Thus , the discovery and subsequent development of novel agents to block HCC invasion and migration are the primary objectives of hepatic cancer research . The Notch1 signaling pathway might be involved in hypoxia-induced carcinoma metastasis . However , the mechanisms by which Notch1 mediates cell metastasis , particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma , are not yet entirely clear . The results of the present study show that hypoxia increases the invasion and migration capacities of different HCC cells . Activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway contributes to hypoxia-induced invasion and migration in HCC cells . The activated Notch1 signaling pathway can regulate Snail/E-cadherin through cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) under hypoxic conditions . The above results suggest that the Notch1/COX-2/Snail/E-cadherin pathway is possibly associated with hypoxia-induced invasion and migration in HCC cells . Thus , targeting Notch1 may be useful for devising novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for HCC .	11	1
Both the deregulation of microRNAs and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) are emerging as important factors in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Here , miR-133b was found to be associated with tumor stage , the extent of regional lymph node involvement , stage , visceral pleura or vessel invasion and EGFR mRNA expression in Chinese patients with NSCLC . Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-133b can interact specifically with the 3'-UTR of EGFR mRNA . Functionally , miR-133b transfection showed regulatory activity in translationally repressing EGFR mRNA . Moreover , miR-133b transfection may modulate apoptosis , invasion and sensitivity to EGFR-TKI through the EGFR signaling pathways , especially in EGFR-addicted NSCLC cells . Taken together , our findings show that miR-133b can inhibit cell growth of NSCLC through targeting EGFR and regulating its downstream signaling pathway . This finding has important implications for the development of targeted therapeutics for a number of EGFR-addicted cancers .	11	1	9	8	93	81
AIMS AND BACKGROUND To investigate a six-drug combination in patients with nonmetastatic Ewing sarcoma , focusing on chemotherapy-induced necrosis and chemotherapy toxicity in adult and pediatric patients . METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN Alternating cycles of vincristine ( 1.5 mg/m2 ) , doxorubicin ( 80 mg/m2 ) and cyclophosfamide ( 1200 mg/m2 ) ( weeks 0 , 6 , 13 , 22 and 31 ) , ifosfamide ( 9 g/m2 ) , vincristine ( 1.5 mg/m2 ) , and actinomycin D ( 1.5 mg/m2 ) ( weeks 3 , 16 , 25 and 34 ) , and ifosfamide ( 9 g/m2 ) and etoposide ( 450 mg/m2 ) ( weeks 9 , 19 , 28 and 37 ) were administered . Primary chemotherapy-induced necrosis was graded : G3 ( complete necrosis ) , G2 ( microfoci of tumor cells ) and G1 ( macrofoci of tumor cells ) . RESULTS From 1996 to 1999 , 50 patients with Ewing sarcoma were enrolled . The median age was 23.5 years ( range , 4-56 ) . Chemotherapy-induced necrosis ( in 28 patients ) was G3 in 36% , G2 in 21% and G1 in 43% . At a median follow-up of 110 months ( range , 36-129 ) , 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were 72% and 66% , respectively . According to histologic response , 5-year event-free survival was 90% in G3 , 83% in G2 , and 42% in G1 ( P = 0.02 ) . In adult and pediatric ( <18 years ) patients , the incidence of G4 leukopenia was 62% and 74% , respectively , with febrile neutropenia in 13% and 21% , respectively . G4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 3% of cycles in adults and in 7% in pediatric patients . Platelet and red blood cell transfusions were required respectively in 1% and 11% of cycles in adults and in 6% and 24% of cycles in pediatric patients . CONCLUSIONS The six-drug combination can be administered safely in adult and pediatric populations . About 40% of patients have a poor chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis , leading to poor probability of survival . New strategies are recommended to improve survival of poor responders to the six-drug combination .	83	8
BACKGROUND The incidence of ovarian cancer has been increasing worldwide and it is currently the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancy . Unlike breast cancer , the prognostic role of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) in ovarian carcinoma remains controversial . METHODS The aim of this preclinical study was to further characterise the biological , molecular and cellular effects of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) using NIH-OVCAR-3 and derived cell lines both in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS In vitro assessments have shown that trastuzumab treatment inhibited total and phosphorylated HER-2 . This was associated with inhibition of the phosphorylated form of phosphatase and tensin homologue ( PTEN ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT , and the total level of p27(kip) . Inhibition of PTEN is associated with phosphorylated MEK1/2 upregulation , suggesting a specific inhibition of the protein phosphatase function of PTEN . Moreover , trastuzumab induced the upregulation of RhoB . These molecular modifications promote inhibition of cell migration and potentially restoration of tumour cell contact inhibition . RhoB induction in NIH-OVCAR-3 control cell lines mimics the molecular and cellular trastuzumab long-time exposition effects . RhoB inhibition in NIH-OVCAR-3 long-time exposed to trastuzumab cell line reverses the cellular and molecular effects observed in this model . In vivo examinations have shown that these changes are also associated with the restoration of structural , morphological and normal functions of the peritoneum of an ovarian carcinoma mouse model . CONCLUSION These results provide an indication of the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumour activity of trastuzumab that strongly implicate RhoB in an ovarian carcinoma model that does not show HER-2 amplification or overexpression . These findings highlight that trastuzumab effects involve a possible cross-talk between RhoB and PTEN in the early stages of tumour re-growth in a model of micrometastatic ovarian cancer .	52	5	9	921	92
The effect of peptides released during the fermentation of milk on the humoral immune system and on fibrosarcoma growth was studied . Lactobacillus helveticus was able to release peptidic compounds during milk fermentation due to its high proteolytic activity , as was shown by the degree of proteolysis and size-exclusion HPLC elution profiles . Three fractions of these compounds were separated and fed to mice during different periods ( 2 , 5 , and 7 d ) . The humoral immune response was assessed by following the number of IgA-secreting cells , and the antitumor activity was monitored by studying the regression of subcutaneously implanted fibrosarcomas . Feeding during 2 and 7 d with the medium-sized fraction ( Fraction II ) significantly increased the IgA-producing cells in the intestines , whereas feeding with the large compound fraction ( Fraction I ) during 5 d and the small compound fraction ( Fraction III ) during all three feeding periods provided similar increases . A double dose of Fraction II showed the highest IgA-producing cell count . The increase by Fraction III was shown to be caused by the presence of L-Tryptophan . Fraction II significantly decreased the size of fibrosarcoma when previously fed during 7 d , and feeding with Fraction I during 5 d decreased significantly its size after 35 d of growth . Although the mechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria enhance the immune system are not clear , this study clearly shows that bioactive compounds released in fermented milks contribute to the immunoenhancing and antitumor properties of these products . The release of bioactive peptides by lactic acid bacteria can have important implications on the modulation of the cellular immune response .	2	21
Klebsiella species are the most extensively studied among a number of 2,3-butanediol ( 2,3-BDO)-producing microorganisms . The ability to metabolize a wide variety of substrates together with the ease of cultivation made this microorganisms particularly promising for the application in industrial-scale production of 2,3-BDO . However , the pathogenic characteristics of encapsulated Klebsiella species are considered to be an obstacle hindering their industrial applications . Here , we removed the virulence factors from three 2,3-BDO-producing strains , Klebsiella pneumoniae KCTC 2242 , Klebsiella oxytoca KCTC1686 , and K. oxytoca ATCC 43863 through site-specific recombination technique . We generated deletion mutation in wabG gene encoding glucosyltransferase which plays a key role in the synthesis of outer core lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) by attaching the first outer core residue D-GalAp to the O-3 position of the L,D-HeppII residue . The morphologies and adhesion properties against epithelial cells were investigated , and the results indicated that the wabG mutant strains were devoid of the outer core LPS and lost the ability to retain capsular structure . The time profile of growth and 2,3-BDO production from K. pneumoniae KCTC 2242 and K. pneumoniae KCTC 2242 \u0394wabG were analyzed in batch culture with initial glucose concentration of 70g/l . The growth was not affected by disrupting wabG gene , but the production of 2,3-BDO decreased from 31.27 to 22.44g/l in mutant compared with that of parental strain . However , the productions of acetoin and lactate from wabG mutant strain were negligible , whereas that from parental strain reached to	
BACKGROUND Cellular and clinical sensitivity to ionizing radiation ( IR ) is determined by DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) repair . Here , we investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the extreme response of a head and neck tumor case ( SKX ) to standard radiotherapy . METHODS Immunofluorescence ( IF ) was used for the assessment of DSB repair , Western blot and real-time PCR for protein and mRNA expression , respectively . RESULTS SKX cells exhibited a pronounced radiosensitivity associated with numerous residual \u03b3-H2AX foci after IR . This was not associated with lacking canonical repair proteins . SKX cells did not express any ATM protein . Accordingly , immunoblotting revealed no ATM kinase activity toward substrates such as p-SMC1 , p-CHK2 and p-KAP1 . Sequencing of all 66 exons of ATM showed no mutation . ATM mRNA level was moderately reduced , which could be reverted by 5'-Aza-C treatment but without restoring protein levels . Importantly , we demonstrated a post-transcriptional regulation in SKX cells via 6-fold enhanced levels of miR-421 , which targets the 3'-UTR of ATM mRNA . Transfection of SKX cells with either anti-miR-421 inhibitor or a microRNA-insensitive ATM vector recovered ATM expression and abrogated the hyper-radiosensitivity . CONCLUSION This is the first report describing microRNA-mediated down-regulation of ATM leading to clinically manifest tumor radiosensitivity .	612	61	62	63	6
The effects of an anti-CD3 mAb on induction of non-MHC restricted cytolysis was investigated . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from normal donors ( 29 ) and cancer patients ( 18 ) were cultured in 100 U/ml of interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) with and without anti-CD3 mAb ( OKT3 , 10 ng/ml ) for the first 48 hours of incubation . Thereafter , both PBMC cultures were maintained on rIL-2 up to 20 days . PBMC proliferation was enhanced 17-fold in number by day 20 when anti-CD3 mAb and rIL-2 was present during the first 48 hours but only 3-fold by day 20 when rIL-2 alone was present . Concomitantly anti-CD3 mAb but not Lym-1 , an isotype matched control , inhibited the induction of lytic activity against both NK sensitive ( K562 ) and NK resistant ( Raji ) target cell lines . Thus the inhibitory effect is dependent on anti-CD3 mAb stimulating the CD3/TCR T-cell receptor complex . While lytic activity was dependent on the concentration of rIL-2 , inhibition of the induction phase of non-MHC restricted lytic activity was independent of the concentration of rIL-2 . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that treatment with the anti-CD3 mAb increased the percentage of CD3 positive cells , CD4 positive cells and especially CD25 positive cells , but decreased th percentage of CD56 positive cells . Supernatants from anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures also inhibited the induction of non-MHC restricted lytic activity . Lymphokine analysis showed that supernatants of anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures had higher levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma . However , TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma alone or in combination could not mediate the inhibitory effect . The inhibitory factor(s) was partially purified by sequential chromatography on matrices of controlled pore glass and Sepharose CL-6B . The molecular weight of the inhibitory factor(s) was less than 67K . These studies have identified a novel regulatory pathway controlling non-MHC restricted cytolysis . Perturbation of the T-cell CD3/TCR complex with the anti-CD3 mAb results in the secretion of a soluble mediator that down-regulates the induction of rIL-2 dependent non-MHC restricted cytolysis .	9	93
The 7WD4 and 7PA2 cell lines , widely used as cellular models for Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) , have been used to investigate the effects of amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor overexpression and amyloid-\u03b2 ( A\u03b2 ) oligomer accumulation on mitochondrial function . Under standard culture conditions , both cell lines , compared to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) control cells , displayed an decrease of O2 respiration as sustained by endogenous substrates . Functional impairment of the respiratory chain was found distributed among the protein complexes , though more evident at the level of complex I and complex IV . Measurements of ATP showed that its synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation is decreased in 7WD4 and 7PA2 cells by this loss being partly compensated by glycolysis ( Warburg effect ) . Compensation proved to be more efficient in 7WD4 than in 7PA2 cells , the latter cell line displaying the highest reactive oxygen species production . The strongest deficit was observed in mitochondrial membrane potential that is almost 40% and 60% lower in 7WD4 and 7PA2 cells , respectively , in comparison to CHO controls . All functional parameters point to a severe bioenergetic impairment of the AD cells , with the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction being correlated to the accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides and oligomers .	
More effective treatments for metastatic lung cancer remain a pressing clinical need . In this study , we identified migration inducting gene-7 ( MIG-7 ) protein as critical for COX-2/prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2)- and Akt/GSK-3β-dependent tumor invasion/metastasis . COX-2/PGE2 activated EP4 to enhance Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation and β-catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor signaling leading to MIG-7 upregulation . RNAi-mediated attenuation of MIG-7 blocked COX-2/PGE2- and Akt/GSK-3β-mediated migration/invasion effects . Furthermore , MIG-7 protein inhibited protein phosphatase 2A to sustain Akt/GSK-3β phosphorylation and cancer-cell migration/invasion . Cancer cells overexpressing MIG-7 exhibited increased expression of ZEB-1 and Twist in parallel with epithelial-mesenchymal transition , metastasis and cancer lethality . MIG-7 protein level positively correlated with advanced stages of human lung cancers . MIG-7 thus offers a theranostic target for cancer metastases arising from aberrant activation of the cellular COX-2/PGE2 and Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathways .	1	11	12
In lung cancer , platelet-derived growth factor receptor α ( PDGFRα ) is expressed frequently by tumor-associated stromal cells and by cancer cells in a subset of tumors . We sought to determine the effect of targeting stromal PDGFRα in preclinical lung tumor xenograft models ( human tumor , mouse stroma ) . Effects of anti-human ( IMC-3G3 ) and anti-mouse ( 1E10 ) PDGFRα monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) on proliferation and PDGFRα signaling were evaluated in lung cancer cell lines and mouse fibroblasts . Therapy studies were conducted using established PDGFRα-positive H1703 cells and PDGFRα-negative Calu-6 , H1993 , and A549 subcutaneous tumors in immunocompromised mice treated with vehicle , anti-PDGFRα mAbs , chemotherapy , or combination therapy . Tumors were analyzed for growth and levels of growth factors . IMC-3G3 inhibited PDGFRα activation and the growth of H1703 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo , but had no effect on PDGFRα-negative cell lines or mouse fibroblasts. 1E10 inhibited growth and PDGFRα activation of mouse fibroblasts , but had no effect on human cancer cell lines in vitro . In vivo , 1E10-targeted inhibition of murine PDGFRα reduced tumor growth as single-agent therapy in Calu-6 cells and enhanced the effect of chemotherapy in xenografts derived from A549 cells . We also identified that low expression cancer cell expression of VEGF-A and elevated expression of PDGF-AA were associated with response to stromal PDGFRα targeting . We conclude that stromal PDGFRα inhibition represents a means for enhancing control of lung cancer growth in some cases , independent of tumor cell PDGFRα expression .	9	93
Imiquimod is a synthetic compound with antitumor properties ; a 5% cream formulation is successfully used to treat skin tumors . The antitumor effect of imiquimod is multifactorial , although its ability to modulate immune responses by triggering TLR7/8 is thought to be key . Among the immune cells suggested to be involved are plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs ) . However , a direct contribution of pDCs to tumor killing in vivo and the mechanism of their recruitment to imiquimod-treated sites have never been demonstrated . Using a mouse model of melanoma , we have now demonstrated that pDCs can directly clear tumors without the need for the adaptive immune system . Topical imiquimod treatment led to TLR7-dependent and IFN-α/β receptor 1-dependent ( IFNAR1-dependent ) upregulation of expression of the chemokine CCL2 in mast cells . This was essential to induce skin inflammation and for the recruitment of pDCs to the skin . The recruited pDCs were CD8α+ and induced tumor regression in a TLR7/MyD88- and IFNAR1-dependent manner . Lack of TLR7 and IFNAR1 or depletion of pDCs or CD8α+ cells from tumor-bearing mice completely abolished the effect of imiquimod . TLR7 was essential for imiquimod-stimulated pDCs to produce IFN-α/β , which led to TRAIL and granzyme B secretion by pDCs via IFNAR1 signaling . Blocking these cytolytic molecules impaired pDC-mediated tumor killing . Our results demonstrate that imiquimod treatment leads to CCL2-dependent recruitment of pDCs and their transformation into a subset of killer DCs able to directly eliminate tumor cells .	a1	a2	a
The HT29 adenocarcinoma is a common model of epithelial cell differentiation and colorectal cancer and its death is an oft-analyzed response to TNF family receptor signaling . The death event itself remains poorly characterized and here we have examined the involvement of caspases using pan-caspase inhibitors. zVAD-fmk did not block death of HT29 cells in response to activation of the Fas , TRAIL , TNF , TWEAK and LTbeta receptors . The secondary induction of TNF or the other known bona fide death inducing ligands did not account for death following LTbeta receptor activation indicating that TNF family receptors can trigger a caspase-independent death pathway regardless of the presence of canonical death domains in the receptor . To provide a frame of reference , the phenotype of HT29 death was compared to four other TNF family receptor triggered death events ; Fas induced Jurkat cell apoptosis , TNF/zVAD induced L929 fibroblast necrosis , TNF induced death of WEHI 164 fibroblastoid cells and TNF/zVAD induced U937 death . The death of HT29 and U937 cells under these conditions is an intermediate form with both necrotic and apoptotic features . The efficient coupling of TNF receptors to a caspase-independent death event in an epithelial cell suggests an alternative approach to cancer therapy .	83	81	8
Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ) are promising epigenetic cancer chemotherapeutics rapidly approaching clinical use . In this study , we tested using in vitro and in vivo models the differential biological effects of a novel HDAC inhibitor [ belinostat ( PXD101) ] , in a wide panel of androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent tumor cells . Belinostat significantly increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 . Belinostat potently inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cell lines ( IC50 range from 0.5 to 2.5 �M ) with cytotoxic activity preferentially against tumor cells . This agent induced G2/M arrest and increased significantly the percentage of apoptosis mainly in androgen-sensitive tumor cells confirming its growth-inhibitory effects . The cell death mechanisms were studied in three different prostate cancer cell lines with different androgen dependence and expression of androgen receptor ; LAPC-4 and 22rv1 ( androgen-dependent and expressing androgen receptor ) and PC3 ( androgen-independent not expressing androgen receptor ) . Belinostat induced the expression of p21 and p27 , acetylation of p53 and G2/M arrest associated with Bcl2 and Bcl-Xl downmodulation and significant reduction of survivin , IAPs and Akt/pAkt and increased caspase-8 and -9 expression/activity . Belinostat effectiveness was dependent on the androgen receptor ( AR ) , since the stable transfection of AR greatly increased the efficacy of this HDAC inhibitor . These observations were correlated using in vivo models . We demonstrated that belinostat preferentially resulted in antitumor effect in androgen-dependent tumor cells expressing AR . Our findings provide evidence that belinostat may be a promising anticancer drug for prostate cancer expressing AR , supporting its clinical role in prostate cancer .	9	91	8	93	81
Curcumin ( CUR ; diferuloylmethane ) , a rhizome extract of Curcuma Longa L. is commonly used as a food coloring and flavoring agent . Although oriental and Ayurvedic medicines have traditionally used CUR in the treatment of diseases , conventional medicine has just begun to recognize its potential therapeutic value . Numerous recent studies have demonstrated the ability of CUR to halt or prevent certain types of cancer , decrease inflammation , and improve cardiovascular health . However , very few studies have examined its ability to protect against drug-induced organ injury . This study explored whether CUR pre-exposure has the potential to prevent acetaminophen ( APAP)-induced : ( i ) hepatotoxicity , ( ii ) genomic injury , ( iii ) oxidative stress in the liver , and ( iv ) apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in the liver in vivo . Additional goals were to investigate the interplay of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes and their ultimate impact on various forms of cell death . In order to study the CUR-APAP interaction , male B6C3F1 mice were gavaged with CUR ( 17 mg/kg/day , p.o. ) for 12 days followed by a single APAP exposure ( 400 mg/kg , ip ) . Four groups of animals ( control , CUR , APAP , CUR+APAP ) were sacrificed 24 h after APAP exposure . The results indicated that APAP-induced liver injury associated events as serum ALT ( 80-fold ) , lipid peroxidation ( 357% ) and DNA fragmentation ( 469% ) were markedly reduced to 3-fold , 134% and 162% , respectively , in the CUR+APAP group . The APAP-induced increase in expression of pro-apoptotic genes ( Bax , caspase-3 ) decreased while expression of anti-apoptotic genes ( Bcl-XL ) increased in CUR preexposed mouse livers , and these changes were mirrored in the pattern of apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths . Levels of DNA damage sensor P⁵³ and its counterpart Mdm2 were also analyzed during this interaction . Based on the available literature , and these results , it seems likely that CUR may impart global protection in vivo against drug-induced liver injury by opposing several crucial events instrumental to both apoptosis and necrosis .	a21	a2	a	8	83	81
The Msh2 DNA mismatch repair gene is one of five genes implicated in the pathogenesis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) . To address the possible mechanisms of the site-specific occurrence of HNPCC , the effect of Msh2 deficiency on mutations in different parts of the colon was investigated using the BC-1(lacI)/Msh2 double transgenic mouse . Compared to the Msh2(+/+) mice , Msh2(-/-) mice had an 8-9-fold increase of mutation frequency ( MF ) in the lacI gene from the cecum and the proximal and distal colon . The mutational spectra were also significantly different between Msh2(+/+) and Msh2(-/-) mice , with a significant increase in the frequency of -1 frameshifts and G:C-->A:T base substitutions in the repair-deficient mice . However , in spite of the site-specific predisposition of HNPCC in humans , we found no significant difference in the MF or mutation spectrum between the three parts of the colon in Msh2(+/+) , Msh2(+/-) , or Msh2(-/-) mice . In addition , 11 independent mutants harboring complex mutations within the lacI gene were recovered in the Msh2(-/-) mice . Interestingly , while the Msh2(+/-) mice displayed an overall MF similar to that observed in the wild-type mice , sequencing revealed a significantly different mutational spectrum between Msh2(+/+) and Msh2(+/-) mice , mainly characterized by an increase in -1 frameshifts . Due to the prevalence of frameshift mutations in HNPCC patients , this haploinsufficiency effect of the Msh2 gene in safeguarding genomic integrity may have important implications for human carrier status .	63	6
Tumor cells trigger angiogenesis through overexpression of various angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and angiopoietin 1 ( Ang1 ) . Therefore , inhibition of the expression of both VEGF and Ang1 , the initial step of tumor angiogenesis , is a promising strategy for cancer chemoprevention and therapy . Grape seed proanthocyanidins ( GSPs ) are widely consumed dietary supplements that have antitumor activity . Due to their polymeric structure , GSPs are poorly absorbed along the gastrointestinal tract and can reach the colon at high concentrations , allowing these chemicals to act as chemopreventive agents for colon cancer . In the present study , we found that GSPs inhibited colon tumor-induced angiogenesis and , thus , the growth of colon tumor xenografts on the chick chorioallantoic membranes . The mechanisms of their action were related to inhibiting the expression of both VEGF and Ang1 through scavenging reactive oxygen species . Previous studies have demonstrated that the chemopreventive effects of GSPs on colon cancer are associated with their growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects . Our results demonstrate another mechanism by which GSPs inhibit colon tumor growth , which will be helpful for developing GSPs as a pharmacologically safe angiopreventive agent against colorectal cancer .	a21	7	711	a2	a	71	8	81
Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 plays a role in insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) signaling ( integrin-IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) cross-talk ) in non-transformed cells in anchorage-dependent conditions . We reported previously that IGF1 directly binds to \u03b1v\u03b23 and induces \u03b1v\u03b23-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation in these conditions . The integrin-binding defective IGF1 mutant ( R36E/R37E ) is defective in inducing ternary complex formation and IGF signaling , whereas it still binds to IGF1R . We studied if IGF1 can induce signaling in anchorage-independent conditions in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells that express \u03b1v\u03b23 ( \u03b23-CHO ) cells . Here we describe that IGF1 signals were more clearly detectable in anchorage-independent conditions ( polyHEMA-coated plates ) than in anchorage-dependent conditions . This suggests that IGF signaling is masked by signals from cell-matrix interaction in anchorage-dependent conditions . IGF signaling required \u03b1v\u03b23 expression , and R36E/R37E was defective in inducing signals in polyHEMA-coated plates . These results suggest that \u03b1v\u03b23-IGF1 interaction , not \u03b1v\u03b23-extracellular matrix interaction , is essential for IGF signaling . Inhibitors of IGF1R , Src , AKT , and ERK1/2 did not suppress \u03b1v\u03b23-IGF-IGF1R ternary complex formation , suggesting that activation of these kinases are not required for ternary complex formation . Also , mutations of the \u03b23 cytoplasmic tail ( Y747F and Y759F ) that block \u03b23 tyrosine phosphorylation did not affect IGF1R phosphorylation or AKT activation . We propose a model in which IGF1 binding to IGF1R induces recruitment of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 to the IGF-IGF1R complex and then \u03b23 and IGF1R are phosphorylated . It is likely that \u03b1v\u03b23 should be together with the IGF1-IGF1R complex for triggering IGF signaling .	63	6	9	93	92
Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment plays a central role in the evolution of immune escape mechanisms by tumor cells . In this study , we report the definition of miR-210 as a miRNA regulated by hypoxia in lung cancer and melanoma , documenting its involvement in blunting the susceptibility of tumor cells to lysis by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL). miR-210 was induced in hypoxic zones of human tumor tissues . Its attenuation in hypoxic cells significantly restored susceptibility to autologous CTL-mediated lysis , independent of tumor cell recognition and CTL reactivity . A comprehensive approach using transcriptome analysis , argonaute protein immunoprecipitation , and luciferase reporter assay revealed that the genes PTPN1 , HOXA1 , and TP53I11 were miR-210 target genes regulated in hypoxic cells . In support of their primary importance in mediating the immunosuppressive effects of miR-210 , coordinate silencing of PTPN1 , HOXA1 , and TP53I11 dramatically decreased tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis . Our findings show how miR-210 induction links hypoxia to immune escape from CTL-mediated lysis , by providing a mechanistic understanding of how this miRNA mediates immunosuppression in oxygen-deprived regions of tumors where cancer stem-like cells and metastatic cellular behaviors are known to evolve .	1	2	12	22
The conserved eukaryotic DNA replication protein ORC1 is one of the constituents of pre-replication complexes that assemble at or very near origins prior to replication initiation . ORC1 has been shown to be constitutively nuclear in Leishmania major . This study investigates the sequences involved in nuclear localization of ORC1 in Leishmania donovani , the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis . Nuclear localization signals ( NLSs ) have been reported in only a few Leishmania proteins . Functional analyses have delineated NLSs to regions of amino acids in length in the tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase I and type II DNA topoisomerase of L. donovani , and in the L. major kinesin KIN13-1 . Using a panel of site-directed mutations we have identified a sequence essential for nuclear import of LdORC1 . This sequence at the N terminus of the protein comprises residues 2-5 ( KRSR ) , with K2 , R3 and R5 being crucial . Independent mutation of the K2 residue causes exclusion of the protein from the nucleus , while mutating the R5 residue leads to diffusion of the protein throughout the cell . This sequence , however , is insufficient for targeting a heterologous protein ( \u03b2-galactosidase ) to the nucleus . Analysis of additional ORC1 mutations and reporter constructs reveals that while the highly basic tetra-amino acid sequence at the N terminus is essential for nuclear localization , the ORC1 NLS in its entirety is more complex , and of a distributive character . Our results suggest that nuclear localization signalling sequences in Leishmania nuclear proteins are more complex than what is typically seen in higher eukaryotes .	
Recent surveys indicate that Pi intake has increased steadily as Pi-containing foods have increased . Our previous study demonstrated that high dietary Pi strongly stimulated lung tumorigeneis . In order to answer the issue whether low Pi may be chemopreventive , we examined the effects of low Pi on lung cancer . Eighteen 5-wk-old male K-ras(LA1) lung cancer model mice were randomly allocated to 2 groups . One group was fed a normal diet ( 0.5% Pi ) and other group was fed low Pi ( 0.1% Pi ) diet for 4 wk . Lung cancer development was evaluated by histopathological examination , Western blot , kinase assay , and immunohistochemistry . Low Pi increased the expression of sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporter 2b , and activated Akt signal with decreased PTEN expression in the lungs of K-ras(LA1) mice . Low Pi increased the Akt/mTOR-mediated protein translation through upregulating the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 . In addition , low Pi stimulated cell cycling as evidenced by altered cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 and D3 . Finally , low Pi increased lung tumorigenesis in K-ras(LA1) mice compared to the normal diet group . Our results clearly demonstrated that low Pi also promoted lung tumorigenesis , thus suggesting that an appropriate intake of dietary Pi may be critical for lung cancer prevention as well as treatment .	91	921	92	9
UNLABELLED Oxygen free radicals and their reactive derivatives participate in formation of chronic inflammation states , which facilitate development of gastrointestinal tract tumors . Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of damage to cell membranes in result of exacerbated lipid peroxidation process . End products of lipid peroxidation ( aldehydes , organic peroxides ) react with important biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins , cause changes in cell membrane structure and properties leading to loss of its integrity . Intensification of the lipid peroxidation process is a factor which may also lead to a malfunction in the antioxidant barrier , which further weakens the defense of cells against oxygen free radicals and promotes the onset and development of cancer . The aim of the study was the determination of lipid peroxidation level in gastrointestinal tract tumors ( stomach , liver , colon , and colorectal cancer to liver metastases ) . MATERIAL AND METHODS Materials for studies were obtained from 150 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors : 10 with stomach cancer , 30 with malignant and benign liver cancers , 60 with primary colorectal cancer , and 50 with metachronous colorectal cancer liver metastases . We also investigated 25 patients with liver cirrhosis , which was treated as a pre-cancerous condition . In total , 175 patients were examined . Tumor specimens , and normal adjacent tissues ( 6-7 cm from the edge of the tumor ) , which served as control tissue in studies , were collected from patients ( with their consent ) during surgery . Additionally , liver specimens were collected from patients with liver cirrhosis . Lipid peroxidation level was determined spectrophotometrically as a concentration of final lipid peroxidation products , which in reaction with tiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) form colour complex ( thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances - TBARS ) . RESULTS The study showed the highest concentration of TBARS in benign , and the lowest in malignant liver tumors . Other types of gastrointestinal tumors studied , were characterized by similar levels of lipid peroxidation . TBARS concentration in these tumors was approximately 2-fold higher than in malignant liver tumors and much lower than in benign tumors . In all cancers of the digestive tract with the exception of malignant liver tumors increased level of TBARS was found , comparing with control tissue . The concentration of TBARS in cirrhotic liver was lower than in control . The level of lipid peroxidation in liver cirrhosis and malignant liver tumors was similar . There were no significant differences in TBARS concentration in the tumors of particular sections of the intestine and normal colon . The highest concentration of TBARS was found in G1 grade of colorectal cancer . In subsequent grades of cells differentiation ( G2 and G3 ) its concentration was lower . The highest level of lipid peroxidation , expressed as the concentration of TBARS was found in the I stage of colorectal cancer clinical advancement . The significantly lowest concentration of TBARS was shown for stage II ( UICC ) . CONCLUSIONS The level of lipid peroxidation in cancerous cells of gastrointestinal tract indicates increased oxidative stress . The changes of lipid peroxidation level--a marker of oxidative stress in gastrointestinal tumors appear to be closely associated with their development stages ( liver cirrhosis/malignant liver cancer ; colorectal cancer/colorectal cancer liver metastases ) and are likely to create such conditions , in which cancerous cells may proliferate , undergo gradual dedifferentiation and malignancy , and generate metastases .	a21	a2	a
We studied the effects of double-strand breaks on intramolecular extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mammalian cells . Pairs of defective herpes thymidine kinase ( tk ) sequences were introduced into mouse Ltk- cells on a DNA molecule that also contained a neo gene under control of the SV40 early promoter/enhancer . With the majority of the constructs used , gene conversions or double crossovers , but not single crossovers , were recoverable . DNA was linearized with various restriction enzymes prior to transfection . Recombination events producing a functional tk gene were monitored by selecting for tk-positive colonies . For double-strand breaks placed outside of the region of homology , maximal recombination frequencies were measured when a break placed the two tk sequences downstream from the SV40 early promoter/enhancer . We observed no relationship between recombination frequency and either the distance between a break and the tk sequences or the distance between the tk sequences . The quantitative effects of the breaks appeared to depend on the degree of homology between the tk sequences . We also observed that inverted repeats recombined as efficiently as direct repeats . The data indicated that the breaks influenced recombination indirectly , perhaps by affecting the binding of a factor(s) to the SV40 promoter region which in turn stimulated or inhibited recombination of the tk sequences . Taken together , we believe that our results provide strong evidence for the existence of a pathway for extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mammalian cells that is distinct from single-strand annealing . We discuss the possibility that intrachromosomal and extrachromosomal recombination have mechanisms in common .	612	61	6
Dietary antioxidants , such as the carotenoids , may protect DNA from oxidative damage . This has been proposed to explain the epidemiological association between higher consumption of fruits and vegetables , which are rich in antioxidants , and lower incidence of cancer . However , this remains to be demonstrated conclusively . The effects of carotenoid supplementation on 1 ) baseline DNA damage , 2 ) susceptibility of cellular DNA to oxidative attack , and 3 ) DNA repair were measured in the human lymphocyte cell line Molt-17 . Baseline DNA damage , susceptibility to oxidant attack ( 100 mumol/l H2O2 for 5 min at 4 degrees C ) , and disappearance of DNA single-strand breaks ( SSB ) after oxidative challenge were monitored by single-cell gel electrophoresis . DNA repair patch synthesis activity in cell extracts was determined using assays that measure nucleotide incorporation during repair of oxidative lesions in template DNA . Unlike single-cell gel electrophoresis , the parameters measured with these assays are not dependent on strand break religation . There was no evidence that beta-carotene , lutein , or beta-cryptoxanthin supplementation protected cellular DNA from oxidation under basal conditions or after oxidative challenge . However , only carotenoid-supplemented cells exhibited a significant decrease in numbers of SSB over a 2-h period after treatment with H2O2 . Carotenoid supplementation did not provoke any detectable change in repair patch synthesis activity . We conclude that supplementation with carotenoids at 8 mumol/l does not provide significant antioxidant protection for DNA in Molt-17 lymphocytes but may enhance recovery of cells from oxidative challenge , as measured by loss of SSB . We argue that these data are most consistent with carotenoids acting to enhance DNA strand break repair .	a	a21	612	61	62	a2	6
The influence of radiation-induced apoptosis on radiosensitivity was studied in a set of closely related human lymphoblastoid cell lines differing in TP53 status . The clonogenic survival of irradiated TK6 cells ( expressing wild-type TP53 ) , WTK1 cells ( overexpressing mutant TP53 ) , and TK6E6 cells ( negative for TP53 owing to transfection with HPV16 E6 ) was assessed in relation to the induction of apoptosis and its suppression by caspase inhibition or treatment with PMA as well as after treatment with caffeine . Measurements using the alkaline comet assay and pulsed-field electrophoresis of the induction and repair of DNA strand breaks showed similar kinetics of the processing of early DNA damage in these cell lines . The cytochalasin B micronucleus assay revealed identical levels of residual damage in the first postirradiation mitosis of these cells . Abrogation of TP53-dependent apoptosis in TK6E6 cells resulted in a distinct increase in radioresistance . Further suppression of apoptosis as observed in WTK1 cells overexpressing mutant TP53 apparently was not responsible for the high radioresistance of WTK1 cells , since other means of highly efficient suppression of apoptosis ( caspase inhibition or PMA treatment ) increased the clonogenic survival of irradiated TK6 cells only to levels similar to those of TK6E6 cells with abrogated TP53-dependent apoptosis . Considering the similar levels of residual chromosomal damage in TK6E6 cells and WTK1 cells , a hitherto unknown mechanism of tolerance needs to be inferred for these TP53 mutant cells . This residual damage tolerance , however , appears to require an intact G2/M-phase checkpoint function since the relative radioresistance of the WTK1 cells was completely lost upon caffeine treatment , which also resulted in a failure of the TK6 and TK6E6 cells to execute apoptosis . In this situation , the cellular response seems to be dominated entirely by TP53-independent mitotic failure .	612	61	62	6	8	81
BACKGROUND To identify potential tumor suppressor genes , genome-wide data from exome and transcriptome sequencing were combined to search for genes with loss of heterozygosity and allele-specific expression . The analysis was conducted on the breast cancer cell line HCC1954 , and a lymphoblast cell line from the same individual , HCC1954BL . RESULTS By comparing exome sequences from the two cell lines , we identified loss of heterozygosity events at 403 genes in HCC1954 and at one gene in HCC1954BL . The combination of exome and transcriptome sequence data also revealed 86 and 50 genes with allele specific expression events in HCC1954 and HCC1954BL , which comprise 5.4% and 2.6% of genes surveyed , respectively . Many of these genes identified by loss of heterozygosity and allele-specific expression are known or putative tumor suppressor genes , such as BRCA1 , MSH3 and SETX , which participate in DNA repair pathways . CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that the combined application of high throughput sequencing to exome and allele-specific transcriptome analysis can reveal genes with known tumor suppressor characteristics , and a shortlist of novel candidates for the study of tumor suppressor activities .	62	6
It is well established that angiogenesis is the process of formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels . It is a complex process , involving both pro- and anti-angiogenic factors , and plays a significant role in physiological and pathophysiological processes such as embryonic development , atherosclerosis , post-ischemic vascularization of the myocardium , tumor growth and metastasis , rheumatoid arthritis etc . This is the first report of zinc oxide ( ZnO ) nanoflowers that show significant pro-angiogenic properties ( formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels ) , observed by in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays . The egg yolk angiogenesis assay using ZnO nanoflowers indicates the presence of matured blood vessels formation . Additionally , it helps to promote endothelial cell ( EA.hy926 cells ) migration in wound healing assays . Formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , especially hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2))-a redox signaling molecule , might be the plausible mechanism for nanoflower-based angiogenesis . Angiogenesis by nanoflowers may provide the basis for the future development of new alternative therapeutic treatment strategies for cardiovascular and ischemic diseases , where angiogenesis plays a significant role .	a21	71	a2	a	7
Jaceosidin , a flavonoid derived from Artemisia princeps ( Japanese mugwort ) , has been shown to inhibit the growth of several human cancer cells , However , the exact mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of jaceosidin is not completely understood . In this study , we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effect of jaceosidin in human endometrial cancer cells . We demonstrated that jaceosidin is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than cisplatin in human endometrial cancer cells . In contrast , jaceosidin-induced cytotoxicity in normal endometrial cells was lower than that observed for cisplatin . Jaceosidin induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and modulated the levels of cyclin B and p-Cdc2 in Hec1A cells . Knockdown of p21 using specific siRNAs partially abrogated jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition . Additional mechanistic studies revealed that jaceosidin treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Cdc25C and ATM-Chk1/2 . Ku55933 , an ATM inhibitor , reversed jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition , in part . Moreover , jaceosidin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK , and pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor , PD98059 , attenuated cell growth inhibition by jaceosidin . These data suggest that jaceosidin , isolated from Japanese mugwort , modulates the ERK/ATM/Chk1/2 pathway , leading to inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex , followed by G2/M cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells .	91	9
Senescence , an inherent tumor suppressive mechanism , is a critical determinant for chemotherapy . In the present study , we show that the monocarboxylate transporter 2 ( MCT2 ) protein was tumor-selectively expressed in human colorectal malignancies and knockdown of MCT2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction , cell-cycle arrest , and senescence without additional cellular stress in colorectal cancer cell lines . Moreover , the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) scavenger , N-acetylcysteine , blocked MCT2 knockdown-induced growth arrest and cellular senescence , indicating a pivotal role of ROS in this pathway . Dramatic induction of mitochondrial superoxide generation and decrease in ATP production was observed , indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is the major mechanism underlying MCT2 knockdown-induced ROS generation . Senescence-associated DNA damage was also evident from the increase in promyelocytic leukemia bodies , γH2AX foci , and SAHF . Conversely , overexpression of MCT2 prevented doxorubicin-induced ROS accumulation ( P = 0.0002 ) and cell growth inhibition ( P = 0.001 ) . MCT2 knockdown suppressed KRAS mutant colorectal tumor growth in vivo . In addition , MCT2 knockdown and cytostatic drug combination further enhanced the antitumor effect . These findings support the use of MCT2 as a promising target for inhibition of colorectal cancer .	a21	9	42	61	a2	4	a	6	91
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) contributes to the control of cell-to-cell communication , cell adhesion , migration or proliferation . In the present study , we investigated the regulation of connexin43 ( Cx43 ) and Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) during the AhR-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells . The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells , which is frequently abolished in cancer cells ; however , the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood . Disruption of contact inhibition , which was induced by toxic AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial WB-F344 cells , reduced Cx43 protein levels , possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation , significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC , in an AhR-dependent manner . Although both intracellular and membrane Cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by TCDD , siRNA-mediated Cx43 knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells . Our data suggest that downregulation of Cx43/GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition , which occurs at the post-transcriptional level . This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication , thus suggesting that toxic AhR agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC , two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression .	5	52
Class switch recombination ( CSR ) in B lymphocytes is initiated by introduction of multiple DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) into switch ( S ) regions that flank immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) constant region exons . CSR is completed by joining a DSB in the donor S mu to a DSB in a downstream acceptor S region ( e.g. , S gamma1 ) by end-joining . In normal cells , many CSR junctions are mediated by classical nonhomologous end-joining ( C-NHEJ ) , which employs the Ku70/80 complex for DSB recognition and XRCC4/DNA ligase 4 for ligation . Alternative end-joining ( A-EJ ) mediates CSR , at reduced levels , in the absence of C-NHEJ , even in combined absence of Ku70 and ligase 4 , demonstrating an A-EJ pathway totally distinct from C-NHEJ . Multiple DSBs are introduced into S mu during CSR , with some being rejoined or joined to each other to generate internal switch deletions ( ISDs ) . In addition , S-region DSBs can be joined to other chromosomes to generate translocations , the level of which is increased by absence of a single C-NHEJ component ( e.g. , XRCC4 ) . We asked whether ISD and S-region translocations occur in the complete absence of C-NHEJ ( e.g. , in Ku70/ligase 4 double-deficient B cells ) . We found , unexpectedly , that B-cell activation for CSR generates substantial ISD in both S mu and S gamma1 and that ISD in both is greatly increased by the absence of C-NHEJ . IgH chromosomal translocations to the c-myc oncogene also are augmented in the combined absence of Ku70 and ligase 4 . We discuss the implications of these findings for A-EJ in normal and abnormal DSB repair .	612	62	61	6
BACKGROUND Γ-Ionizing radiation ( IR ) therapy is one of major therapeutic tools in cancer treatment . Nevertheless , γ-IR therapy failed due to occurrence of metastasis , which constitutes a significant obstacle in cancer treatment . The main aim of this investigation was to construct animal model which present metastasis during radiotherapy in a mouse system in vivo and establishes the molecular mechanisms involved . MATERIALS AND METHODS The C6L transfectant cell line expressing firefly luciferase ( fLuc ) was treated with γ-IR , followed by immunoblotting , zymography and invasion assay in vitro . We additionally employed the C6L transfectant cell line to construct xenografts in nude mice , which were irradiated with γ-IR . Irradiated xenograft-containing mice were analyzed via survival curves , measurement of tumor size , and bioluminescence imaging in vivo and ex vivo . Metastatic lesions in organs of mice were further assessed using RT-PCR , H & E staining and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS γ-IR treatment of C6L cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and increased cell invasion . In irradiated xenograft-containing mice , tumor sizes were decreased dramatically and survival rates extended . Almost all non-irradiated xenograft-containing control mice had died within 4 weeks . However , we also observed luminescence signals in about 22.5% of γ-IR-treated mice . Intestines or lungs of mice displaying luminescence signals contained several lesions , which expressed the fLuc gene and presented histological features of cancer tissues as well as expression of EMT markers . CONCLUSIONS These findings collectively indicate that occurrences of metastases during γ-IR treatment accompanied induction of EMT markers , including increased MMP activity . Establishment of a murine metastasis model during γ-IR treatment should aid in drug development against cancer metastasis and increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process .	1	11	12
We recently reported that chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) patients harbour high levels of STAT5 when they progress to advanced phases of disease . Advanced disease is characterized by an increased incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations . We now describe a highly significant correlation between STAT5 expression and the incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations in primary CML . Forced expression of STAT5 in murine BCR-ABL1 transformed cells sufficed to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and to trigger DNA damage . STAT5-mediated ROS production is independent of JAK2 but requires concomitant BCR-ABL1 signalling as forced STAT5 expression in untransformed BCR-ABL1 negative cells has no impact on ROS levels . Only within the context of a BCR-ABL1 positive cell does STAT5 transcriptionally regulate a target gene or set of genes that causes the enhanced ROS production . Our study suggests the existence of a feed-forward loop accelerating disease progression , in which BCR-ABL1 enhances its own mutation rate in a STAT5-ROS dependent manner . This model explains the increased occurrence of inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations in advanced disease stages driven and characterized by high STAT5 expression .	a21	61	63	a	6	a2
Osteopetrosis , a disorder of skeletal bone , can cause death during childhood . We previously described a new spontaneous autosomal recessive osteopetrosis mouse mutant , " new toothless " ( ntl ) . In this study , we reported for the first time the identification , cloning and characterization of the coiled-coil domain-containing 154 ( CCDC154 ) , a novel gene whose deletion of kb sequence including exons 1-6 was completely linked to the ntl mutant . The CCDC154 was conserved between mouse and human and is wildly expressed in mouse tissues . The cellular localization of CCDC154 was in the early endosomes . Overexpression of CCDC154 inhibited cell proliferation of HEK293 cells by inducing G 2/M arrest . CCDC154 also inhibited tumor cell growth , and the soft agar assay revealed a significant decrease of the colony size of Hela cells upon transfection of CCDC154 . Our results indicate that CCDC154 is a novel osteopetrosis-related gene involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression growth .	
Cancer cells undergo multi-step processes in obtaining the ability to metastasize , and are constantly exposed to signals that induce apoptosis . Acquisition of anti-apoptotic properties by cancer cells is important for metastasis , and recent studies suggest that transforming growth factor ( TGF)-β promotes the survival of certain types of cancer cells . Here , we found that in highly metastatic breast cancer cells , JygMC(A) , JygMC(B) and 4T1 , TGF-β ligands were produced in autocrine fashion . Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TGF-β signalling by a TGF-β type I receptor kinase inhibitor in serum-free conditions increased the expression of BH3-only protein , Bim ( also known as Bcl2-like 11 ) in JygMC(A) and JygMC(B) cells , and caused apoptotic cell death . We also found that induction of Bim by TGF-β was not observed in Foxc1 knocked-down cancer cells . These findings suggest that TGF-β plays a crucial role in the regulation of survival of certain types of cancer cells through the TGF-β-Foxc1-Bim pathway , and that specific inhibitors of TGF-β signalling might be useful as apoptosis inducers in breast cancer cells .	8	92	81	9
Our recent studies have mechanistically demonstrated that cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) produce energy-rich metabolites that functionally support the growth of cancer cells . Also , several authors have demonstrated that DNA instability in the tumor stroma greatly contributes to carcinogenesis . To further test this hypothesis , we stably knocked-down BRCA1 expression in human hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts ( shBRCA1 ) using an shRNA lentiviral approach . As expected , shBRCA1 fibroblasts displayed an elevated growth rate . Using immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis , shBRCA1 fibroblasts demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and mitophagy . Most notably , shBRCA1 fibroblasts also displayed an elevation of HIF-1α expression . In accordance with these findings , shBRCA1 fibroblasts showed a 5.5-fold increase in ketone body production ; ketone bodies function as high-energy mitochondrial fuels . This is consistent with the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction in BRCA1-deficient fibroblasts . Conversely , after 48 h of co-culturing shBRCA1 fibroblasts with a human breast cancer cell line ( MDA-MB-231 cell ) , mitochondrial activity was enhanced in these epithelial cancer cells . Interestingly , our preclinical studies using xenografts demonstrated that shBRCA1 fibroblasts induced an increase in tumor growth when co-injected with MDA-MB-231 cells into nude mice . We conclude that a BRCA1 deficiency in the tumor stroma metabolically promotes cancer progression , via ketone production .	
The morphology characteristics of cell apoptosis of the malignant tumour cells in magnetic field-treated mouse was observed for the first time . The apoptotic cancer cell contracted , became rounder and divorced from adjacent cells ; the heterochromatin condensed and coagulated together along the inner side of the nuclear membrane ; the endoplasmic reticulums ( ER ) expanded and fused with the cellular membrane ; many apoptotic bodies which were packed by the cellular membrane appeared and were devoured by some lymphocytes and plasma . Apoptosis of cancer cells was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediatedin situ nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) . It was found that the number of apoptosis cancer cells of the sample treated by the magnetic field is more than that of the control sample . The growth of malignant tumour in mice was inhibited and the ability of immune cell to dissolve cancer cells was improved by ultralow frequency ( ULF ) pulsed gradient magnetic field ; the nuclei DNA contents decreased , indicating that magnetic field can block DNA replication and inhibit mitosis of cancer cells . It was suggested that magnetic field could inhibit the metabolism of cancer cell , lower its malignancy , and restrain its rapid and heteromorphic growth . Since ULF pulsed gradient magnetic field can induce apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibit the growth of malignant tumour , it could be used as a new method to treat cancer .	8	81
The aim of this work was to characterize the antitumoral activity of the plant compound 7-epi-nemorosone in prostate carcinoma cell lines . Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer death in men . In spite of the current therapeutic options for this cancer entity , many patients die due to metastases in distant organs and acquired chemotherapy resistance . Thus , approaches to provide improvements in outcome and quality of life for such patients are urgently needed . Recently , the polyisoprenylated benzophenone 7-epi-nemorosone , originally collected by honeybees from Clusia rosea and Clusia grandiflora ( Clusiaceae ) , has been described to be a potent antitumoral agent . Here , its activity in prostate carcinoma is reported. 7-epi-nemorosone was isolated from Caribbean propolis employing RP-HPLC techniques . Its cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT proliferation assay in human androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells including an MDR1(+) sub-line . No cross-resistance was detected . FACS-based cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in the sub-G0/G1 , G1 , and depletion in the S phase populations . A concomitant down-regulation of cyclins D1/D3 and CDK 4/6 in LNCaP cells was detected by Western blot . Annexin-V-FITC labeling and caspase-3 cleavage assays showed that 7-epi-nemorosone induced apoptotic events . Major signal transduction elements such as p38 MAPK and Akt/PKB as well as androgen receptor AR and PSA production were found to be down-regulated after exposure to the drug . ERK1/2 protein levels and phosphorylation status were down-regulated accompanied by up-regulation but inhibition of the activity of their immediate upstream kinases MEK1/2 . Additionally , Akt/PKB enzymatic activity was effectively inhibited at a similar concentration as for MEK1/2 . Here , we demonstrate for the first time that 7-epi-nemorosone exerts cytotoxicity in an androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma entity by targeting the MEK1/2 signal transducer .	81	9	8	91	921	92
Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal and common malignant human brain tumors , with aggressive proliferation and highly invasive properties . Honokiol derived from Magnolia officinalis is able to cross the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier ( BCSFB ) , suggesting a strong possibility that it could be an effective drug for the treatment of brain tumors , including glioblastoma . Thus , we investigated the effects of honokiol on the expression of adhesion molecules in TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells , and cancer growth and invasion were determined in T98G human glioblastoma cells . Honokiol dose-dependently inhibited the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) stimulated with TNF-α for 6 h . Pretreatment with honokiol significantly reduced the adhesion of T98G cells to HUVECs . Moreover , honokiol inhibited the invasion of T98G cells , suggesting that honokiol has an anti-metastatic effect . In addition , honokiol increased the cytotoxicity of T98G cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner as assayed by MTT . TUNEL assay showed that honokiol significantly induced apoptosis in T98G cells at doses of 10 �M or more . The induction of apoptotic cell death was mediated by the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax . Taken together , the results of this study suggest that honokiol exerts an anticancer effect by preventing metastasis and inducing apoptotic cell death of brain tumor cells .	11	12	1	8	81
Osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures after minimal trauma . OI type V has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and is not caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 . The most remarkable and pathognomonic feature , observed in of affected individuals , is a predisposition to develop hyperplastic callus after fractures or surgical interventions . To identify the molecular cause of OI type V , we performed whole-exome sequencing in a female with OI type V and her unaffected parents and searched for de novo mutations . We found a heterozygous de novo mutation in the 5'-untranslated region of IFITM5 ( the gene encoding Interferon induced transmembrane protein 5 ) , 14 bp upstream of the annotated translation initiation codon ( c.-14C>T ) . Subsequently , we identified an identical heterozygous de novo mutation in a second individual with OI type V by Sanger sequencing , thereby confirming that this is the causal mutation for the phenotype . IFITM5 is a protein that is highly enriched in osteoblasts and has a putative function in bone formation and osteoblast maturation . The mutation c.-14C>T introduces an upstream start codon that is in frame with the reference open-reading frame of IFITM5 and is embedded into a stronger Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation than the annotated start codon . In vitro , eukaryotic cells were able to recognize this start codon , and they used it instead of the reference translation initiation signal . This suggests that five amino acids ( Met-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro ) are added to the N terminus and alter IFITM5 function in individuals with the mutation .	
A novel camptothecin derivative ( TLC388 ) with higher efficacy and reduced toxicity has been synthesized and tested as a novel chemoradiosensitizing agent . This study investigated the mechanisms of the chemoradiosensitizing effects of TLC388 on H23 human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells . Using the TUNEL assay , a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells was observed in the group treated with TLC388 plus X-ray radiation than those in groups treated with drug or radiation alone . The sensitizer enhancement ratio ( SER ) was 1.91 . Apoptosis increased with drug concentration and radiation dose , exhibiting dose-dependent pattern . The results suggested that apoptosis could be a main mode of cell death that might underlie the increased chemoradio-sensitization of TLC388 . Treatment with 30 nM of TLC388 plus 4 Gy X-ray also produced up to 42% of necrotic cells that were measured by trypan blue exclusion assay , but with TLC388 alone or 4 Gy radiation alone 9.8% or 11.1% necrotic cells were detected , respectively . An immunofluorescent staining method was employed to determine the levels of gamma-H2AX ( phosphorylated H2AX , a variant of the H2A protein family , which is a component of the histone octomer in nucleosomes and is phosphorylated by kinases like ATM and ATR in the PI3K pathway , as the first step in recruiting and localizing DNA repair proteins ) as a molecular biomarker of DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) in cells treated with TLC388 +/-radiation , or radiation alone . The formation of gamma-H2AX foci was observed after TLC388 or radiation exposure and when the cells were treated with 30 nM TLC388 plus radiation at a dose of 2 Gy , the percentage of cells containing gamma-H2AX foci increased significantly . Even more interesting , a markedly higher percentage ( 65.4% ) of mitotic cells displayed gamma-H2AX foci after treatment with 30 nM TLC388 plus 0.5 Gy radiation , compared to only 5.9% or 26.1% of the M-phase cells treated with 30 nM TLC388 alone or 0.5 Gy radiation alone , respectively . It is suggested that mitotic cells become very sensitive to the production of DSBs after TLC388-radiation combined treatment and the formation of DSBs is strongly suggested to lead to the induction of apoptosis at doses lower than 4 Gy and to some necrosis at doses of 4 Gy or above . TLC388 enhances the production of DSBs and inhibits their repair , which contributes to the elucidation of the mechanisms of chemoradiosensitization of TLC388 and its development as a novel chemoradiosensitizing drug for improved radiotherapy .	612	6	61	62	8	83	81
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ ( PPARγ ) , a subgroup of ligand-activated nuclear receptors , plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation , differentiation , apoptosis and invasion . PPARγ is involved in tumorigenesis and is a potent target for cancer therapy . PPARγ transactivation of KLF4 has been demonstrated in various studies ; however , how PPARγ regulates KLF4 expression is not clear . In this study , we revealed that PPARγ regulates the expression of KLF4 by binding directly to the PPAR response element ( PPRE ) within the KLF4 promoter . The PPRE resided at -1657bp to -1669bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon , which is essential for the transactivation of TGZ-induced KLF4 expression . Furthermore , we found that stable silencing of KLF4 obviously suppressed the G1/S arrest and anti-proliferation effects induced by PPARγ ligands . Taken together , our data indicated that upregulating KLF4 upon PPARγ activation is mediated through PPRE in KLF4 promoter , thus providing further insights into PPARγ signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy .	9	51	511	5	91
Mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor-β gene ( THRB ) cause resistance to thyroid hormone ( RTH ) . A mouse model of RTH harboring a homozygous thyroid hormone receptor ( TR)-β mutation known as PV ( Thrb(PV/PV) mouse ) spontaneously develops follicular thyroid cancer ( FTC ) . Similar to RTH patients with mutations of two alleles of the THRB gene , the Thrb(PV/PV) mouse exhibits elevated thyroid hormones accompanied by highly nonsuppressible TSH . However , the heterozygous Thrb(PV/+) mouse with mildly elevated TSH ( does not develop FTC . The present study examined whether the mutation of a single allele of the Thrb gene is sufficient to induce FTC in Thrb(PV/+) mice under stimulation by high TSH . Thrb(PV/+) mice and wild-type siblings were treated with propylthiouracil ( PTU ) to elevate serum TSH . Thrb(PV/+)mice treated with PTU ( Thrb(PV/+)-PTU ) spontaneously developed FTC similar to human thyroid cancer , but wild-type siblings treated with PTU did not . Interestingly , approximately 33% of Thrb(PV/+)-PTU mice developed asymmetrical thyroid tumors , as is frequently observed in human thyroid cancer . Molecular analyses showed activation of the cyclin 1-cyclin-dependent kinase-4-transcription factor E2F1 pathway to increase thyroid tumor cell proliferation of Thrb(PV/+)-PTU mice . Moreover , via extranuclear signaling , the PV also activated the integrin-Src-focal adhesion kinase-AKT-metalloproteinase pathway to increase migration and invasion of tumor cells . Therefore , mutation of a single allele of the Thrb gene is sufficient to drive the TSH-simulated hyperplastic thyroid follicular cells to undergo carcinogenesis . The present study suggests that the Thrb(PV/+)-PTU mouse model potentially could be used to gain insights into the molecular basis underlying the association between thyroid cancer and RTH seen in some affected patients .	
Nutrient deprivation based on the loss of essential amino acids by catabolic enzymes in the microenvironment is a critical means to control inflammatory responses and immune tolerance . Here we report the novel finding that Tph-1 ( tryptophan hydroxylase-1 ) , a synthase which catalyses the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin and exhausts tryptophan , is a potent regulator of immunity . In models of skin allograft tolerance , tumor growth , and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , Tph-1 deficiency breaks allograft tolerance , induces tumor remission , and intensifies neuroinflammation , respectively . All of these effects of Tph-1 deficiency are independent of its downstream product serotonin . Because mast cells ( MCs ) appear to be the major source of Tph-1 and restoration of Tph-1 in the MC compartment in vivo compensates for the defect , these experiments introduce a fundamentally new mechanism of MC-mediated immune suppression that broadly impacts multiple arms of immunity .	2	22
Tumor cells exhibit enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production even when supplied with adequate oxygen ( a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect , or aerobic glycolysis ) . Pharmacological inhibition of aerobic glycolysis represents a potential tumor-selective approach that targets the metabolic differences between normal and malignant tissues . Human breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells were used to develop an assay system to discover natural product-based glycolysis inhibitors . The assay employed was based on hypersensitivity to glycolytic inhibition in tumor cells treated with the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor rotenone . Under such conditions , ATP supply , and hence cell viability , depends exclusively on glycolysis . This assay system was used to evaluate 10648 plant and marine organism extracts from the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Open Repository . Bioassay-guided isolation of an active Moronobea coccinea extract yielded the new bis-geranylacylphloroglucinol derivative moronone ( 1 ) . Compound 1 exhibited enhanced antiproliferative/cytotoxic activity in the presence of rotenone-imposed metabolic stress on tumor cells . Surprisingly , mechanistic studies revealed that 1 did not inhibit glycolysis , but rather functions as a protonophore that dissipates the mitochondrial proton gradient . In the presence of rotenone , tumor cells may be hypersensitive to protonophores due to increased ATP utilization by the ATP synthase .	31	3
The number of renal cancers has increased over the last ten years and patient survival in advanced stages remains very poor . Therefore , new therapeutic approaches for renal cancer are essential . Englerin A is a natural product with a very potent and selective cytotoxicity against renal cancer cells . This makes it a promising drug candidate that may improve current treatment standards for patients with renal cancers in all stages . However , little is known about englerin A's mode of action in targeting specifically renal cancer cells . Our study is the first to investigate the biological mechanism of englerin A action in detail . We report that englerin A is specific for renal tumor cells and does not affect normal kidney cells . We find that englerin A treatment induces necrotic cell death in renal cancer cells but not in normal kidney cells . We further show that autophagic and pyroptotic proteins are unaffected by the compound and that necrotic signaling in these cells coincided with production of reactive oxygen species and calcium influx into the cytoplasm . As the first study to analyze the biological effects of englerin A , our work provides an important basis for the evaluation and validation of the compound's use as an anti-tumor drug . It also provides a context in which to identify the specific target or targets of englerin A in renal cancer cells .	a	a21	a2	8	82	83
The concept of targeting new blood vessel formation , or angiogenesis , in tumors is an important advancement in cancer therapy , resulting , in part , from the development of such biologic agents as bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A . The rationale for antiangiogenic therapy is based on the hypothesis that if tumors are limited in their capacity to obtain a new blood supply , so too is their capacity for growth and metastasis . Additional evidence suggests that pruning and/or " normalization " of irregular tumor vasculature and reduction of hypoxia may facilitate greater access of cytotoxic chemotherapy ( CT ) to the tumor . Indeed , for metastatic colorectal cancer , bevacizumab in combination with established CT regimens has efficacy superior to that of CT alone . Despite longer progression-free and overall survival times than with CT alone , patients still progress , possibly because of alternative angiogenic " escape " pathways that emerge independent of VEGF-A , or are driven by hypoxic stress on the tumor . Other VEGF family members may contribute to resistance , and many factors that contribute to the regulation of tumor angiogenesis function as part of a complex network , existing in different concentrations and spatiotemporal gradients and producing a wide range of biologic responses . Integrating these concepts into the design and evaluation of new antiangiogenic therapies may help overcome resistance mechanisms and allow for greater efficacy over longer treatment periods .	
A predictive mathematical model of the transition from the G2 phase in the cell cycle to mitosis ( M ) was constructed from the known interactions of the proteins that are thought to play significant roles in the G2 to M transition as well as the DNA damage- induced G2 checkpoint . The model simulates the accumulation of active cyclin B1/Cdk1 ( MPF ) complexes in the nucleus to activate mitosis , the inhibition of this process by DNA damage , and transport of component proteins between cytoplasm and nucleus . Interactions in the model are based on activities of individual phospho-epitopes and binding sites of proteins involved in G2/M . Because tracking phosphoforms leads to combinatorial explosion , we employ a rule-based approach using the BioNetGen software . The model was used to determine the effects of depletion or over-expression of selected proteins involved in the regulation of the G2 to M transition in the presence and absence of DNA damage . Depletion of Plk1 delayed mitotic entry and recovery from the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest and over-expression of MPF attenuated the DNA damage-induced G2 delay . The model recapitulates the G2 delay observed in the biological response to varying levels of a DNA damage signal . The model produced the novel prediction that depletion of pkMyt1 results in an abnormal biological state in which G2 cells with DNA damage accumulate inactive nuclear MPF . Such a detailed model may prove useful for predicting DNA damage G2 checkpoint function in cancer and , therefore , sensitivity to cancer therapy .	51	61	5	6	511
The mammalian COP9 signalosome ( CSN ) complex is involved in cell transformation , but its molecular mechanism remains undetermined . Here we show that disruption of the fifth component ( CSN5 ) prevented the formation of tumors by p53-null cells transformed with an active form of Ras in subcutaneously injected mice . Depletion of CSN5 suppressed cell proliferation , and induced premature senescence characterized by upregulation of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase activity and increased expression of CDK inhibitors . CSN5-depleted cells exhibited enhanced activation of the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway , and chemical inhibition of this pathway reduced the level of senescence . Thus , CSN5 is suggested to be a novel target in cancer therapy and for drugs against tumor cells harboring mutated p53 .	63	42	4	6
Prevention of environmentally related cancer will be enhanced by the availability of sensitive early warning systems and by improvements in quantitative assessment of human risks . Accordingly , we have carried out a series of molecular epidemiologic studies aimed at validating a panel of biologic markers , including carcinogen-DNA and -protein adducts , sister chromatid exchange , micronucleus formation , DNA strand breaks , and DNA repair capacity . Results from three such studies illustrate the usefulness of these biomarkers in elucidating low-dose-response relationships , correlations between biomarkers , and the range of variation in biomarkers between individuals exposed to similar concentrations of carcinogens . Low-level workplace or ambient exposures to styrene , ethylene oxide , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) were associated with significant increases in both molecular dose of carcinogens ( adducts ) and various markers of preclinical effects . Correlations between biomarkers varied by exposure . For example , in the styrene study , sister chromatid exchange frequency was not correlated with any of the markers , in contrast to the studies of ethylene oxide and PAH . Significant molecular effects were observed not only in occupationally exposed people but also in residents of an area in Poland characterized by high levels of air pollution . For example , the mean PAH-DNA level in exposed residents ( winter sample ) was 30.4 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides . This level was significantly higher than that of adducts seen in summer samples from the same area ( 4.2/10(8) , or in winter samples from residents of a rural area ( 11.01/10(8) . Significant seasonal variation in PAH-DNA adduct formation in this group was consistent with recorded fluctuations in air pollution levels . Striking interindividual variation was observed in all three exposed populations .	61	611	6
PURPOSE Radiation therapy appears to kill cells mainly by inducing DNA double-strand breaks . We investigated whether the DNA repair gene expression status might influence the risk of locoregional recurrence ( LRR ) in breast cancer patients . METHODS AND MATERIALS We used a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR-based approach to measure messenger RNA levels of 20 selected DNA repair genes in tumor samples from 97 breast cancer patients enrolled in a phase III trial ( Centre René Huguenin cohort ) . Normalized mRNA levels were tested for an association with LRR-free survival ( LRR-FS ) and overall survival ( OS ) . The findings were validated in comparison with those of an independent cohort ( Netherlands Cancer Institute ( NKI ) cohort ) . Multivariate analysis encompassing known prognostic factors was used to assess the association between DNA repair gene expression and patient outcome . RESULTS RAD51 was the only gene associated with LRR in both cohorts . With a median follow-up of 126 months in the CRH cohort , the 5-year LRR-FS and OS rates were 100% and 95% in the 61 patients with low RAD51 expression , compared with 70% and 69% in the 36 patients with high RAD51 expression , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) . RAD51 overexpression was associated with a higher risk of LRR ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 12.83 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] , 3.6-45.6 ) and death ( HR , 4.10 ; 95% CI , 1.7-9.7 ) . RAD51 overexpression was also significantly associated with shorter LRR-FS and OS in the NKI cohort . CONCLUSIONS Overexpression of RAD51 , a key component of the homologous DNA repair pathway , is associated with poor breast cancer outcome . This finding warrants prospective studies of RAD51 as a prognosticator and therapeutic target .	62	6
Proline- , glutamic acid- and leucine-rich protein-1/modulator of non-genomic activity of estrogen receptor ( ER ) ( PELP1/MNAR ) is a novel nuclear receptor ( NR ) co-activator that plays an essential role in the actions of ER . Emerging findings suggest that PELP1/MNAR is a novel proto-oncogene , whose expression is deregulated in several hormone-responsive cancers , including endometrial cancer . In this study , we demonstrate that PELP1/MNAR is widely expressed in endometrial carcinoma cell lines . To investigate its possible role in endometrial carcinoma progression , we adopted an RNA interference technology to downregulate PELP1/MNAR expression in Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells . PELP1/MNAR downregulation substantially reduced cell proliferation , and the cells in which PELP1/MNAR expression was knocked down also exhibited a decreased migration and invasion ability , as shown by Boyden chamber and invasion assays . The results showed that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was also decreased . These results suggest that PELP1/MNAR plays a role in endometrial cancer progression and metastasis , and that PELP1/MNAR may be a potential therapeutic target for endometrial cancer .	9	11	1	12
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is constitutively activated in over 90% of human colorectal cancer . Activated β-catenin stimulates cell proliferation and survival , however , its anti-apoptotic mechanisms are not fully understood . We show here that activated β-catenin is required to suppress caspase-8 activation but only in colon cancer cells that are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF ) induced apoptosis . We found that lysosomal delivery of internalized TNF occurred at a faster pace in apoptosis-resistant than in apoptosis-sensitive colon cancer cells . Retardation of endosomal trafficking through V-ATPase inhibition enhanced caspase-8 activation in the apoptosis-resistant but not sensitive cells . Interestingly , knockdown of β-catenin also prolonged TNF association with the early endosome and enhanced caspase-8 activation in the apoptosis-resistant but not sensitive colon cancer cells . In a mouse model of inflammation-associated colon tumors , we found nuclear expression of β-catenin , resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis , and reactivation of apoptosis in vivo by cotreatment of TNF with a V-ATPase inhibitor . Together , these results suggest that activated β-catenin can facilitate endosomal trafficking of internalized TNF to suppress caspase-8 activation in colon cancer cells .	a	a2	81	8
A 39-year-old male without contributory medical history had sustained progressive double vision , ptosis , and trigeminal pain for 2 weeks . Physical examination revealed total ophthalmoplegia and visual field defect with normal blood examination and chest radiography . Cranial computed tomography revealed a hyperdense mass in the left frontotemporal fossae with bony erosion . Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a broad-based , intensely enhanced extraaxial tumor of 4x4x4 cm diameter with dural tail sign . Cerebral angiography demonstrated insignificant blood supply both from the internal carotid and middle meningeal arteries . Nearly total tumor resection was achieved via orbitofrontotemporal craniotomy . Intraoperative findings revealed the extraaxial tumor with broad attachment to the dura mater and invasion to the optic and oculomotor nerves . Histological examination revealed hypercellular tumor with significant cell atypism , mitotic activity , and focal necrosis . Immunohistochemical staining was positive for AE1/3 and c-kit , but negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein . Systemic examination performed postoperatively revealed a thymic tumor without additional remote lesions . The final diagnosis was metastatic brain tumor from thymic carcinoma . Rapid progression of neurological impairment inconsistent with a benign extraaxial tumor needs prompt surgical intervention .	83	8
Energy deregulation and abnormalities of tumor cell metabolism are critical issues in understanding cancer . Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , and one known to be highly metastatic and unusually lethal . There is considerable utility in establishing preclinical cell and xenograft models for study of disorders of energy metabolism , as well as in development of new therapeutic approaches targeting of tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle enzyme-deficient human cancers . Here we describe a new immortalized cell line , UOK 262 , derived from a patient having aggressive HLRCC-associated recurring kidney cancer . We investigated gene expression , chromosome profiles , efflux bioenergetic analysis , mitochondrial ultrastructure , FH catabolic activity , invasiveness , and optimal glucose requirements for in vitro growth . UOK 262 cells have an isochromosome 1q recurring chromosome abnormality , i(1)(q10) , and exhibit compromised oxidative phosphorylation and in vitro dependence on anaerobic glycolysis consistent with the clinical manifestation of HLRCC . The cells also display glucose-dependent growth , an elevated rate of lactate efflux , and overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and of lactate dehydrogenase A ( LDHA ) . Mutant FH protein was present primarily in edematous mitochondria , but with catalytic activity nearly undetectable . UOK 262 xenografts retain the characteristics of HLRCC histopathology . Our findings indicate that the severe compromise of oxidative phosphorylation and rapid glycolytic flux in UOK 262 are an essential feature of this TCA cycle enzyme-deficient form of kidney cancer . This tumor model is the embodiment of the Warburg effect . UOK 262 provides a unique in vitro and in vivo preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer .	31	3
This study is to investigate the effects of bortezomib on the angiogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . We examined the effects of bortezomib on the cellular proliferation , migration , and capillary network formation of HUVECs cocultured with CMs of MSCs . We found that Bortezomib inhibited the cellular proliferation and tube formation of HUVECs cocultured with CMs in a dose-dependent fashion . Bortezomib also prevented the migration of HUVECs cocultured with CMs . In addition , bortezomib dose-dependently inhibited the growth of MSCs and prevented the production of angiogenic factors including VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , HGF ( hepatocyte growth factor ) , and bFGF ( basic fibroblast growth factor ) in MSCs . In conclusion , bortezomib prevented the angiogenesis mediated by MSCs .	71	711	7
The effects of 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) are mediated through activation of estrogen receptors ( ER ) : ERalpha and ERbeta . It is known that ERalpha/ERbeta ratio is higher in breast tumors than in normal tissue . Since antioxidant enzymes and uncoupling proteins ( UCPs ) are reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and mitochondrial biogenesis regulators , our aim was to study the E2-effect on oxidative stress , antioxidant enzyme expression , and UCPs in breast cancer cell lines with different ERalpha/ERbeta ratios . The lower ERalpha/ERbeta ratio T47D cell line showed low ROS production and high UCP5 levels . However , the higher ERalpha/ERbeta ratio MCF-7 cell line showed an up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs , yet exhibited high oxidative stress . As a result , a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities and UCP2 protein levels , coupled with an increase in oxidative damage was found . On the whole , these results show different E2-effects on oxidative stress regulation , modulating UCPs , and antioxidant enzymes , which were ERalpha/ERbeta ratio dependent in breast cancer cell lines .	a21	61	a2	a	6	9	93
Bladder cancer is one of the most common tumors of the genitourinary tract ; however , the molecular events underlying growth and invasion of the tumor remain unclear . Here , role of the CXCR7 receptor in bladder cancer was further explored . CXCR7 protein expression was examined using high-density tissue microarrays . Expression of CXCR7 showed strong epithelial staining that correlated with bladder cancer progression . In vitro and in vivo studies in bladder cancer cell lines suggested that alterations in CXCR7 expression were associated with the activities of proliferation , apoptosis , migration , invasion , angiogenesis and tumor growth . Moreover , CXCR7 expression was able to regulate expression of the proangiogenic factors IL-8 or VEGF , which may involve in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis . Finally , we found that signaling by the CXCR7 in bladder cancer cells activates AKT , ERK and STAT3 pathways . The AKT and ERK pathways may reciprocally regulate , which are responsible for in vitro and in vivo epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) process of bladder cancer . Simultaneously targeting the two pathways by using U0126 and LY294002 inhibitors or using CCX733 , a selective CXCR7 antagonist drastically reduced CXCR7-induced EMT process . Taken together , our data show for the first time that CXCR7 plays a role in the development of bladder cancer . Targeting CXCR7 or its downstream-activated AKT and ERK pathways may prove beneficial to prevent metastasis and provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer .	11	92	7	711	1	71	8	9	921	81
Human carcinomas are defined by recurrent chromosomal aneuploidies , which result in a tissue-specific distribution of genomic imbalances . In order to develop models for these genome mutations and to determine their role in tumorigenesis , we generated 45 spontaneously transformed murine cell lines from normal epithelial cells derived from bladder , cervix , colon , kidney , lung , and mammary gland . Phenotypic changes , chromosomal aberrations , centrosome number , and telomerase activity were assayed in control uncultured cells and in three subsequent stages of transformation . Supernumerary centrosomes , binucleate cells , and tetraploidy were observed as early as 48 hr after explantation . In addition , telomerase activity increased throughout progression . Live-cell imaging revealed that failure of cytokinesis , not cell fusion , promoted genome duplication . Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that aneuploidy preceded immortalization , consisting predominantly of whole chromosome losses ( 4 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and Y ) and gains ( 1 , 10 , 15 , and 19 ) . After transformation , focal amplifications of the oncogenes Myc and Mdm2 were frequently detected . Fifty percent of the transformed lines resulted in tumors on injection into immunocompromised mice . The phenotypic and genomic alterations observed in spontaneously transformed murine epithelial cells recapitulated the aberration pattern observed during human carcinogenesis . The dominant aberration of these cell lines was the presence of specific chromosomal aneuploidies . We propose that our newly derived cancer models will be useful tools to dissect the sequential steps of genome mutations during malignant transformation , and also to identify cancer-specific genes , signaling pathways , and the role of chromosomal instability in this process .	4	63	41	6
BACKGROUND Inorganic arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental carcinogen affecting millions of people worldwide . Evolving theory predicts that normal stem cells ( NSCs ) are transformed into cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) that then drive oncogenesis . In humans , arsenic is carcinogenic in the urogenital system ( UGS ) , including the bladder and potentially the prostate , whereas in mice arsenic induces multi-organ UGS cancers , indicating that UGS NSCs may represent targets for carcino-genic initiation . However , proof of emergence of CSCs induced by arsenic in a stem cell population is not available . METHODS We continuously exposed the human prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cell line WPE-stem to an environmentally relevant level of arsenic ( 5 microM ) in vitro and determined the acquired cancer phenotype . RESULTS WPE-stem cells rapidly acquired a malignant CSC-like phenotype by 18 weeks of exposure , becoming highly invasive , losing contact inhibition , and hyper-secreting matrix metalloproteinase-9 . When hetero-transplanted , these cells ( designated As-CSC ) formed highly pleomorphic , aggressive tumors with immature epithelial- and mesenchymal-like cells , suggesting a highly pluripotent cell of origin . Consistent with tumor-derived CSCs , As-CSCs formed abundant free-floating spheres enriched in CSC-like cells , as confirmed by molecular analysis and the fact that only these floating cells formed xeno-graft tumors . An early loss of NSC self-renewal gene expression ( p63 , ABCG2 , BMI-1 , SHH , OCT-4 , NOTCH-1 ) during arsenite exposure was sub-sequently reversed as the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was progressively suppressed and the CSC-like phenotype acquired . CONCLUSIONS Arsenite transforms prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells into CSC-like cells , indicating that it can produce CSCs from a model NSC population .	11	1	5	52
SCOPE Glyceollins are a novel class of soybean phytoalexins with potential cancer-preventive and antiestrogenic effects . The angiogenic cascade during tumor development consists of the release of angiogenic factors and binding of angiogenic factors to receptors on endothelial cells to activate downstream signaling pathways . However , the potential medicinal value of glyceollins , especially in antiangiogenesis , remains unexplored . METHODS AND RESULTS Here , we investigated the antiangiogenic activity of glyceollins and their underlying mechanisms . Glyceollins inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) or basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) induced in vitro angiogenic activity . Glyceollins inhibited VEGF receptor-2 or FGF receptor-1 activity and their downstream signaling pathways such as extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 , c-Jun N-terminal kinase , as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and focal adhesion kinase induced by VEGF or bFGF . Glyceollins significantly suppressed VEGF receptor-2 kinase activity assayed by the ELISA . Glyceollins significantly attenuated in vivo and ex vivo microvessel development in a dose-dependent manner and tumor growth by suppressing microvessel density in Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) mouse xenograft . CONCLUSION Thus , glyceollins , elicited ingredients of soy source , target the signaling pathways mediated by VEGF or bFGF , providing new perspectives into potential therapeutics for preventing and treating hypervascularized diseases including cancer .	71	711	7
During tumorigenesis , cells acquire immortality in association with the development of genomic instability . However , it is still elusive how genomic instability spontaneously generates during the process of tumorigenesis . Here , we show that precancerous DNA lesions induced by oncogene acceleration , which induce situations identical to the initial stages of cancer development , trigger tetraploidy/aneuploidy generation in association with mitotic aberration . Although oncogene acceleration primarily induces DNA replication stress and the resulting lesions in the S phase , these lesions are carried over into the M phase and cause cytokinesis failure and genomic instability . Unlike directly induced DNA double-strand breaks , DNA replication stress-associated lesions are cryptogenic and pass through cell-cycle checkpoints due to limited and ineffective activation of checkpoint factors . Furthermore , since damaged M-phase cells still progress in mitotic steps , these cells result in chromosomal mis-segregation , cytokinesis failure and the resulting tetraploidy generation . Thus , our results reveal a process of genomic instability generation triggered by precancerous DNA replication stress .	612	51	61	5	6
The relationship between DNA damage and repair of peripheral blood leukocytes , liver , kidney and brain cells was investigated in Swiss albino mice ( Mus musculus L. ) after exposure to sevoflurane ( 2.4 vol% for 2 h daily , for 3 days ) . Genetic damage of mouse cells was investigated by the comet assay and micronucleus test . To perform the comet assay , mice were divided into a control group and 4 groups of exposed mice sacrificed on day 3 of the experiment , at 0 , 2 , 6 or 24 h after the last exposure to sevoflurane . Mean tail length ( TL ) , tail moment ( TM ) , and tail intensity ( TI ) values were significantly higher in exposed mice ( all examined organs ) than in the control group . Significant DNA damage immediately after exposure to sevoflurane was observed in leukocytes . Damage induction in the liver , kidney , and brain occurred 6 h later than in leukocytes , as expected according to the toxicokinetics of the drug , where blood is the first compartment to absorb sevoflurane . However , none of the tested tissues revealed signs of repair until 24 h after the exposure . To distinguish the unrepaired genome damage in vivo , the micronucleus test was applied . Number of micronuclei in reticulocytes showed a statistically significant increase , as compared with the control group at all observed times after the treatment .	61	62	6
Breast cancer includes high number of molecular entities targetable by specific agents . In this study , array CGH and PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations were used to drive patients into targeted therapy . A prospective molecular analysis was offered to metastatic breast cancer patients for whom samples were collected prospectively or retrospectively either from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue . Analyses were performed using array CGH ( Agilent platform ) and PIK3CA ( exon 10 and 21 ) and AKT1 mutations were explored by standard Sanger sequencing . One hundred and eight patients were included . Good quality CGH was obtained in 79% cases and was better for frozen samples . Genomic alterations were identified in 50% of patients including 11 PIK3CA and 8 AKT1 mutations . Eighteen treatments ( 17 patients ) were administered according to their molecular profile with evidence of activity in nine . Reasons for not providing a genomic-driven treatment included absence of progressive disease ( 38% ) , investigator's choice ( 9% ) , rapid PD ( 19% ) , and no drug access ( 21% ) . Array CGH correctly identified Her2 status in 97% cases ; failures were related to low % of tumour cells . Our study showed that array CGH is feasible in the context of daily practice and , in combination with PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations , identifies a significant number of actionable molecular alterations that allow driving patients into specific targeted agents .	63	6
BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is an aggressive malignancy with few treatment options . As the status of the tumour immune microenvironment can affect progression of established tumours , we evaluated potential immune mechanisms associated with survival in HCC . METHODS Immune gene expression profiles were analyzed in tumour and non-tumour liver tissues from resected HCC patients using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry . Tumour-infiltrating leukocytes ( TILs ) were isolated to verify the expression of immune genes and to identify proliferating TILs . These parameters were analyzed statistically in relation with patient survival and tumour phenotype ( apoptosis and proliferation ) . RESULTS The immune microenvironment within tumours was found to be heterogeneous , although globally more inert compared to the adjacent non-tumour liver tissue . Univariate analysis in 61 patients identified a group of innate immune genes whose expression within tumours is positively associated with patient survival . TNF , IL6 and CCL2 are the most significant genes , with TNF being an independent predictor of survival in multivariate analysis . The gene set includes macrophage and NK-associated molecules such as TLR4 , TLR3 , CCR2 , NCR3 . Most of these molecules are expressed by TILs . Importantly , proliferating immune cells , predominantly NK and T cells , are present in tumours of patients with longer survival , and exclusively in areas devoid of proliferating tumour cells . NK and CD8(+) T cell densities are correlated positively with tumour apoptosis , and negatively with tumour proliferation . CONCLUSIONS Hence , an inflammatory immune microenvironment within HCC tumours could be an important means to control tumour progression via TIL activation and proliferation .	a1	2	21	a
Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax is a rare occurrence in patients with both primary and metastatic lung cancer . Pneumothorax occurring as a complication of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) inhibitor therapy has not been previously described in the medical literature . Sunitinib malate is a VEGFR inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma . We present a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma manifested as bilateral pulmonary nodules who developed a bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax 3 weeks after initiation of sunitinib therapy . We believe that sunitinib therapy resulted in necrosis of multiple pleural-based pulmonary nodules with central cavernization and ultimately rupture with bronchopleural fistula formation . Based on this experience , we advise that practitioners exercise caution when prescribing anti-VEGFR therapy in patients with pleural-based pulmonary metastases and recognize that the efficacy and toxicity of these agents may be closely linked .	83	8
The neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) tumor suppressor gene encodes merlin , a membrane/cytoskeleton protein necessary for the maintenance of contact inhibition of growth in cells . Bi-allelic inactivation of NF2 is known to cause multiple cancers in both humans and mice . However , the mechanism through which merlin exerts its tumor-suppressive function remains obscure . In this report , we show that NF2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts lost contact inhibition of cell proliferation and contained significantly increased canonical Wnt signaling . Inhibition of Rac1 , the activity of which is inversely regulated by NF2 , through the use of a dominant-negative mutant , small hairpin RNA or a small molecule inhibitor in NF2-deficient cells , was able to suppress elevated Wnt signals as shown by reduced activity of the T-cell factor 4 ( TCF4 ) transcription factor . Dominant-negative TCF4 or Rac1 mutant , as well as a small molecule inhibition of Wnt , were able to curb NF2 deficiency-elicited cell proliferation at the confluent state . Thus , Rac1-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is essential for the loss of contact inhibition in NF2-deficient cells .	5	52
The atmospheric polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) partition appreciably in the gas phase , where they undergo rapid oxidation . The atmospheric oxidation mechanisms of a few PCDDs , initiated by OH radical , are studied using density functional theory calculations . The oxidations start with OH-addition to the aromatic rings , dominantly at \u03b3-sites , followed by the non-chlorinated \u03b2-sites ; while additions to the \u03b1-sites or chlorinated sites are negligible . For PCDDs with all \u03b2-sites being chlorinated , formation of PCDD-\u03b3-OH adducts become virtually the only reaction path . Under the atmospheric conditions , the PCDD-\u03b2/\u03b3-OH adducts combine with O(2) slowly at rates <1s(-1) . Instead , the PCDD-\u03b2-OH adducts will react with O(2) through hydrogen abstraction at rates <50s(-1) , forming PCDD-\u03b2-ol , and the PCDD-\u03b3-OH adducts will decompose to the substituted phenoxy radicals by fused-ring C-O bond cleavage at rates of 10(3) s(-1) . The reaction mechanisms of PCDDs are drastically different from the peroxy mechanism for the atmospheric oxidations of benzene and dibenzofuran .	
A new cell line , CB109 , has been established from a human glioblastoma multiforme . The cytoskeleton was positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein , vimentin and fibronectin . Hyaluronan ( HA ) and the HA-binding protein hyaluronectin ( HN ) were expressed in the cell cytoplasm and in the extracellular matrix of spheroids and plated cells . Hyaluronidase did not prevent spheroid formation suggesting that HA was not involved in the cell-cell adhesion . HA precoating prevented cell adherence to the plates and favoured spheroid formation . HA was secreted in relatively large amounts into the culture medium . High performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that HA was in the high molecular weight form . The rate of HN secretion by cells was very low . Basic fibroblast growth factor significantly increased the proliferation in vitro and tumour growth after grafting into nude mice . The epidermal growth factor receptor was not expressed on cultivated CB109 cells . Cytogenetic analysis showed polysomy 7 , structural rearrangement of chromosome 10 short arm and a translocation 13q13-q14 without detectable alteration of the RB gene .	9	93	92
Infection by Opisthorchis viverrini , a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) may act through chronic inflammation , oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation ( LPO)-related damage and growth stimuli. 1,N6-etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine ( epsilondA ) , and 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine ( epsilondC ) , markers for LPO-derived DNA damage were highly increased in white blood cell and urine of O. viverrini-infected Thai patients . In order to investigate tissue specificity etheno adducts were measured in a cholangiocarcinogenesis model , in O. viverrini-infected hamsters that had received N-nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA , 12.5 ppm in dw ) for 2 months. epsilondA- and epsilondC-levels were analyzed in paraffin-embedded liver sections by a novel immunohistochemical method , from 21 up to 180 days post-O. viverrini-infection . In inflamed areas of the liver , etheno adducts were localized in the nuclei of inflammatory cells and in the epithelial lining of the bile duct . Semi-quantitative image analysis showed higher adduct levels in the liver of O. viverrini-infected hamsters , treated with or w/o NDMA when compared with untreated controls . Levels were found highest in the liver of O. viverrini-infected plus NDMA-treated hamsters . Adducts increased in an age-dependent manner from O. viverrini-infection until CCA development . Increased adduct formation paralleled histopathological changes in plasma alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity , bile duct hyperplasia , dysplasia , precancerous lesions , and CCA appearance . Also elevated expression of alkyladenine DNA glycosylase ( AAG ) , which excises 1,N6-ethenoadenine ( epsilonA ) was linked to higher adduct formation , suggesting imbalanced repair . Our results implicate accumulation of inflammation-related , promutagenic DNA damage in target tissue and possibly imbalanced repair in the onset of cholangiocarcinogenesis .	a	611	61	62	a2	6
BACKGROUND Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast cancer ( GREB1 ) was an estrogen receptor ( ER ) target gene , and GREB1 expression inversely correlated with HER2 status , possibly as a surrogate marker for ER status and a predictor for tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients . In the present study , we examine the function and regulation of GREB1 in breast cancer , with the goal to develop GREB1 as a biomarker in breast cancer with de novo and acquired tamoxifen resistance . METHODS We overexpressed GREB1 using adenovirus containing the full length GREB1 cDNA ( Ad-GREB1 ) in breast cancer cell lines . The soft agar assay was used as a measure of anchorage independent growth . The effects of GREB1 on cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells transduced with Ad-GREB1 were also measured by the me olic activity using AlamarBlue assay . We tested whether there was interaction between STAT3 and ER , which could repress GREB1 expression by immunoprecipitation assay . The effects of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 cascade activation on estrogen-induced GREB1 promoter activity were determined by luciferase assay and those on gene expression were measured by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) . RESULTS We found that the ability of breast cancer cells to grow in soft agar is enhanced following GREB1 transfection . In MCF-7 cells transduced with Ad-GREB1 or transfected with siRNA GREB1 , the metabolic activity was increased or completely abolished , suggesting that GREB1 may function as a growth promoter in breast cancer . E2 treatment increased GREB1 promoter luciferase activity . IL-6 inhibited E2-induced GREB1 transcription activity and GREB1 mRNA expression . Constitutively expressing active STAT3 construct ( STAT3-C ) dramatically decreased GREB1 transcription . CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that overexpression of GREB1 promotes cell proliferation and increases the clonogenic ability in breast cancer cells . Moreover , Il6/STAT3 modulates estrogen-induced GREB1 transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells .	9	92
Hypoxia and other adverse conditions are commonly encountered by rapidly growing cells . The RNA-binding protein RBM3 ( RNA-binding motif protein 3 ) , which is transcriptionally induced by low temperature and hypoxia , has recently been implicated in survival of colon cancer cells by mechanisms involving cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) signaling . Immunohistochemically , we found strong RBM3 expression in a variety of malignant and proliferating tissues but low expression in resting and terminally differentiated cells . RBM3 expression in fibroblasts and human embryonal kidney ( HEK293 ) cells subjected to serum deprivation or contact inhibition closely paralleled proliferation rates , assessed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. siRNA-mediated RBM3 knockdown reduced cell viability and finally led to cell death , which did not involve caspase-3-mediated apoptosis , cell cycle arrest , or COX-2 regulation . In contrast , RBM3 over-expression rescued cells from death under serum starvation . This was associated with increased translation rates , as measured by C serine and H phenylalanine incorporation . Together , RBM3 is a critical factor providing cellular survival advantages in an adverse microenvironment presumably by restoring translation efficacy .	
Trabecular meshwork ( TM ) cells have widely been used as an invitro model for glaucoma research . However , primary TM cells suffer the disadvantages of limited cell numbers and slow rates of proliferation . We discovered a spontaneously transformed bovine TM ( BTM ) cell line , BTM-28T . This cell line proliferated rapidly in low-glucose culture medium but also demonstrated contact inhibition in high-glucose culture medium . BTM-28T cells expressed key TM cell markers including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin ( \u03b1-SMA ) , laminin and collagen IV ( col IV ) . Also , 100nM dexamethasone ( DEX ) enhanced the formation of cross-linked actin networks ( CLANs ) in confluent BTM-28T cell cultures . Transforming growth factor beta 2 ( TGF\u03b22 ) induced the expression of fibronectin ( FN ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , and connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) in our cell cultures . This cell line will be helpful to better understand the aqueous humor outflow pathway as related to the pathophysiology of glaucoma .	5	52
Ceramide induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death associated with increased levels of p27(kip1) . The aim of this study was to examine the effects of ceramide on p27(kip1) protein levels as a measure of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . Results showed that ceramide increased p27(kip1) protein levels through activation of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells . Treatment of cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or with PP2A-Cα siRNA inhibited ceramide-induced enhanced p27(kip1) protein expression and Akt dephosphorylation , and prevented Skp2 downregulation . Overexpression of constitutively active Akt attenuated ceramide-induced Skp2 downregulation and p27(kip1) upregulation . In addition , ceramide stimulated binding of the PP2A catalytic subunit PP2A-Cαβ to Akt as assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments , indicating that PP2A is involved in the induction of p27(kip1) via inhibition of Akt pathway . Finally , whether PP2A can regulate p27(kip1) expression independently of Akt pathway was determined . Knockdown of PP2A-Cα with siRNA reduced p27(kip1) levels in the presence of Akt inhibitor . These data reveal that PP2A is a regulator of ceramide-induced p27(kip1) expression via Akt-dependent and Akt-independent pathways .	51	9	5	511	921	92
A rat colonic adenocarcinoma was implanted subcutaneously ( s.c. ) in nude mice . After 7 days , the animals were divided into different groups . Two groups received subcutaneous injections twice daily with 3 or 6 micro g/kg body weight octreotide , galanin and serotonin . Three groups were respectively treated with 20 , 30 , and 40 micro g/kg body weight of the previously mentioned bioactive substances . Control group received only saline solution in the same fashion as treated animals . The treatment lasted for 5 days . The tumour volume and weight , the relative density of blood vessels , of tumour necrotic tissue , of apoptotic nuclei and of proliferating nuclei were measured . Apoptosis was detected by in situ labelling of nuclear DNA fragmentation according to TUNEL method , and proliferation by immunocytochemistry . Morphometry was done with the classical stereological point-counting method . Food consumption , animal weight , faeces weight and its water content were measured for 3 days before and after treatment . Triple therapy with 3 and 6 micro g/kg body weight had no effect on any of the parameters measured , except in reducing the relative volume density of tumour blood vessels . Treatment with 20 , 30 and 40 micro g/kg body weight of the previously mentioned bioactive substances reduced the tumour volume , the relative volume density of blood vessels and increased the relative volume density of necrotic tissue and of apoptotic nuclei ( in the 20 micro g group ) . However , there was no difference between treated mice and controls regarding the relative volume density of proliferating nuclei . There was no statistical difference between treated animals regarding food consumption , body weight , faeces weight and its water content before and during treatment . The present study confirms that triple therapy with octreotide , galanin and serotonin causes regression of a rat colon carcinoma . It further showed that optimum treatment dose is 20 micro g/kg body weight of each bioactive substance . Moreover , this therapy regime does not show apparent side effects in the experiments carried out on mice .	71	7	8	83	81
BACKGROUND Methyl sulfone is a small molecule that reverses cancerous phenotypes of a melanoma cell line . Here , we sought to determine whether methyl sulfone was effective against human breast cancer tissue . METHODS We studied normal and cancerous breast tissue obtained from 17 patients . RESULTS Methyl sulfone introduced structural order , with cancer tissue taking on the morphology of normal in vivo breast tissue ; this structural order was sustainable over long-term culture . Methyl sulfone promoted proper wound healing , including migration of cells into wounded areas and establishment of stable contact inhibition once wounds were covered . Methyl sulfone decreased expression of two breast stem cell marker proteins , HCAM and OCT3/4 , which are associated with aberrantly rapid migration of metastatic cells . Finally , normal and cancerous primary breast cells remained viable and healthy in methyl sulfone culture for at least 90 days . CONCLUSION Methyl sulfone reintroduced a normal structural phenotype to human breast cancer tissues .	11	12	52	1	5
BACKGROUND Knowledge of gene expression kinetics around neuronal cell birth is required to dissect mechanisms underlying progenitor fate . Here , we timed cell cycle and neuronal protein silencing/induction during cell birth in the developing murine retina . RESULTS The pan-cell cycle markers Pcna and Mcm6 were present in the post-mitotic ganglion cell layer . Although confined to the neuroblastic layer ( NBL ) , 6-7% of Ki67(+) cells lacked six progenitor/cell cycle markers , and expressed neuronal markers . To define protein extinction/induction timing , we defined G2/M length throughout retinogenesis , which was typically 1-2 h , but <10% cells took double this time . BrdU-chase analyses revealed that at E12.5 , Tubb3 ( Tuj1 ) appeared at M-phase , followed by Calb2 and Dcx at h , Elavl2/3/4 at h , and Map2 at h after cell birth , and these times extended with embryonic age . Strikingly , Ki67 was not extinguished until up to a day after cell cycle exit , coinciding with exit from the NBL and induction of late markers such as Map1b/Uchl1/Rbfox3 . CONCLUSIONS A minor population of progenitors transits slowly through G2/M and , most importantly , some cell cycle proteins are retained for an unexpectedly long period in post-mitotic neurons . The high-resolution map of cell birth kinetics reported here provides a framework to better define mechanisms that regulate neurogenesis .	
Hypoxia–reoxygenation ( HR ) is a primary driver of angiogenesis in both atherogenesis and tumorigenesis . The main target of hypoxia-driven proangiogenic signaling is adherens junctions responsible for contact inhibition of endothelial cells . We analyzed the effects of hypoxia ( 8–12 hours ) followed by a brief period of reoxygenation ( 2 hours ) ( HR ) on angiogenesis and integrity of adherens junction in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as the effects of aspirin on modulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ' response to HR . Cells exposed to HR displayed considerable enhancement of tube formation ( angiogenesis ) on matrigel . Immunocytostaining of near-confluent cells revealed that HR caused disruption of adherens junctions and internalization of their components VE-cadherin , p120 catenin , and b-catenin . Additionally , HR resulted in the appearance of binucleated cells , and VE-cadherin in colocalization with b-catenin was found to be positioned between the separating nuclei . Presence of aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid , 1 mM ) resulted in preservation of adherens junctions on the cellular membrane and prevented angiogenesis as well as mitosis . HR caused upregulation LOX-1 , the p47(phox) subunit of NADPH , while reducing transcription of endothelial nitric oxide synthase . Aspirin had no effect on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and canceled the transcriptional activation of the LOX-1 and p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase . Based on these data , we hypothesize that aspirin preserves the integrity of adherens junctions and thus blunts angiogenic response to HR through downregulation of LOX-1 and the LOX-1-mediated p47(phox) component of NADPH oxidase transcription , thus preventing NADPH oxidase assembly and function .	7	71
OBJECTIVE Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) secondary to EGFR gene amplification is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a worse clinical outcome . The purpose of this study was to analyze whether blocking this receptor with the anti-EGFR chimeric monoclonal antibody C225 would decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis in GBM cells . METHODS EGFR expression and amplification were analyzed for seven human GBM cell lines . These lines were then exposed to different concentrations of C225 for 48 hours , 72 hours , and 7 days , after which time cytotoxicity , apoptosis , and vascular endothelial growth factor expression were assessed in vitro . Two EGFR-amplified human GBM were implanted in the flanks of nude mice , and the animals received C225 twice per week intraperitoneally for 5 weeks . Tumor volumes and survival times were compared with those of sham-treated mice . RESULTS EGFR gene amplification was demonstrated in three of the primary GBM lines . C225 treatment produced significant cytotoxicity in all three EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines . Flow cytometry demonstrated increased apoptosis in C225-treated , EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines . There was a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor expression in all GBM lines with exposure to C225 . Tumor-bearing mice treated with C225 experienced significant inhibition of tumor growth as well as a 200% increase in median survival . CONCLUSION Blocking EGFR in GBM cells that overexpress this receptor significantly changes tumor cell biology by promoting apoptosis while decreasing proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor expression . This approach holds great promise for the treatment of patients with GBMs .	7	711	71	9	8	93	81
Complex interactions between effector T cells and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells ( Treg ) contribute to clinical outcomes in cancer , and autoimmune and infectious diseases . Previous work showed that IL-12 reversed Treg-mediated suppression of CD4(+)Foxp3(-) T cell ( Tconv ) proliferation . We and others have also shown that Tregs express T-bet and IFN-γ at sites of Th1 inflammation and that IL-12 induces IFN-γ production by Tregs in vitro . To investigate whether loss of immunosuppression occurs when IFN-γ is expressed by Tregs we treated mouse lymphocyte cultures with IL-12 . IFN-γ expression did not decrease the ability of Tregs to suppress Tconv proliferation . Rather , IL-12 treatment decreased Treg frequency and Foxp3 levels in Tregs . We further showed that IL-12 increased IL-2R expression on Tconv and CD8 T cells , diminished its expression on Tregs and decreased IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells . Together , these IL-12 mediated changes favored the outgrowth of non-Tregs . Additionally , we showed that treatment with a second cytokine , IL-27 , decreased IL-2 expression without augmenting Tconv and CD8 T cell proliferation . Notably , IL-27 only slightly modified levels of IL-2R on non-Treg T cells . Together , these results show that IL-12 has multiple effects that modify the balance between Tregs and non-Tregs and support an important role for relative levels of IL-2R but not for IFN-γ expression in IL-12-mediated reversal of Treg immunosuppression .	2	21	22
Although the expression of extracellular matrix protein-1 ( ECM1 ) has been documented in several tumor models , the function of ECM1 has remained unclear . In this study , expression of ECM1 was detected by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry . The role and mechanism of ECM1 overexpression in cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) cells were assessed by wound-healing , matrigel invasion assay and Western blotting . Expression of ECM1 was significantly elevated in CCA tissues than that in adjacent noncancerous , cholangitis and normal bile duct tissues . Its overexpression was associated with poor differentiation , lymph node metastasis , poor prognosis , and the level of CA199 , MMP-9 , estrogen receptor . Knockdown of ECM1 suppressed migration and invasion of CCA cells . Using PI3K or IKK inhibitor reduced the level of phospho-Akt or phospho-IκBα as well as ECM1 . Taken together , overexpression of ECM1 may contribute to CCA initiation and progression through promoting migration and invasion of CCA cells , its overexpression was associated with Akt/NF-κB signaling axis .	11	1
Hormone-dependent estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancers generally respond well to anti-estrogen therapy . Unfortunately , hormone-independent estrogen receptor negative ( ER- ) breast cancers are aggressive , respond poorly to current treatments and have a poor prognosis . New approaches and targets are needed for the prevention and treatment of ER- breast cancer . The NF-κB signaling pathway is strongly implicated in ER- tumor genesis , constituting a possible target for treatment . Hydrogen sulfide-releasing aspirin ( HS-ASA ) , a novel and safer derivative of aspirin , has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent . We examined the growth inhibitory effect of HS-ASA via alterations in cell proliferation , cell cycle phase transitions , and apoptosis , using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model of triple negative breast cancer . Tumor xenografts in mice , representing human ER- breast cancer , were evaluated for reduction in tumor size , followed by immunohistochemical analysis for proliferation , apoptosis and expression of NF-κB . HS-ASA suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by induction of G(0)/G(1) arrest and apoptosis , down-regulation of NF-κB , reduction of thioredoxin reductase activity , and increased levels reactive oxygen species . Tumor xenografts in mice , were significantly reduced in volume and mass by HS-ASA treatment . The decrease in tumor mass was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation , induction of apoptosis and decrease in NF-κB levels in vivo . HS-ASA has anti-cancer potential against ER- breast cancer and merits further study .	a	a21	a2	9	8	81
Dichlorvos , an organophosphate ( OP ) , is known to cause oxidative stress in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Previously we have shown that dichlorvos treatment promoted the levels of proinflammatory molecules and ultimately induced apoptotic cell death in primary microglial cells . Here we studied the effect of dichlorvos on crucial cell cycle regulatory proteins and the DNA damage sensor ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) . We found a significant increase in p53 and its downstream target , p21 , levels in dichlorvos-treated microglial cells compared with control cells . Moreover , dichlorvos exposure promoted the levels of different cell cycle regulatory proteins . These results along with flow cytometry results suggested that primary microglial cells were arrested at G1 and G2/M phase after dichlorvos exposure . We have shown in a previous study that dichlorvos can induce DNA damage in microglia ; here we found that microglial cells also tried to repair this damage by inducing a DNA repair enzyme , i.e. , ATM . We observed a significant increase in the levels of ATM after dichlorvos treatment compared with control .	511	5	51
A fully intact immune system would be expected to hinder the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy by inhibiting viral replication . Simultaneously , however , it may also enhance antitumor therapy through initiation of proinflammatory , antiviral cytokine responses at the tumor site . The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a fully intact immune system on the antitumor efficacy of an oncolytic virus . In this respect , injection of oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) into subcutaneous B16ova melanomas in C57Bl/6 mice leads to tumor regression , but it is not associated with viral replicative burst in the tumor . In contrast , intratumoral delivery of VSV induces an acute proinflammatory reaction , which quickly resolves concomitantly with virus clearance . Consistent with the hypothesis that therapy may not be dependent on the ability of VSV to undergo progressive rounds of replication , a single-cycle VSV is equally effective as a fully replication-competent VSV , whereas inactivated viruses do not generate therapy . Even though therapy is dependent on host CD8+ and natural killer cells , these effects are not associated with interferon-gamma-dependent responses against either the virus or tumor . There is , however , a strong correlation between viral gene expression , induction of proinflammatory reaction in the tumor and in vivo therapy . Overall , our results suggest that acute innate antiviral immune response , which rapidly clears VSV from B16ova tumors , is associated with the therapy observed in this model . Therefore , the antiviral immune response to an oncolytic virus mediates an intricate balance between safety , restriction of oncolysis and , potentially , significant immune-mediated antitumor therapy .	a1	a2	a
The DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) pathway corrects specific types of DNA replication errors that affect microsatellites and thus is critical for maintaining genomic integrity . The genes of the MMR pathway are highly conserved across different organisms . Likewise , defective MMR function universally results in microsatellite instability ( MSI ) which is a hallmark of certain types of cancer associated with the Mendelian disorder hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer . ( Lynch syndrome ) . To identify previously unrecognized deleted genes or loci that can lead to MSI , we developed a functional genomics screen utilizing a plasmid containing a microsatellite sequence that is a host spot for MSI mutations and the comprehensive homozygous diploid deletion mutant resource for Saccharomyces cerevisiae . This pool represents a collection of non-essential homozygous yeast diploid ( 2N ) mutants in which there are deletions for over four thousand yeast open reading frames ( ORFs ) . From our screen , we identified a deletion mutant strain of the PAU24 gene that leads to MSI . In a series of validation experiments , we determined that this PAU24 mutant strain had an increased MSI-specific mutation rate in comparison to the original background wildtype strain , other deletion mutants and comparable to a MMR mutant involving the MLH1 gene . Likewise , in yeast strains with a deletion of PAU24 , we identified specific de novo indel mutations that occurred within the targeted microsatellite used for this screen .	62	63	6
BACKGROUND Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a fatal plasma cell malignancy exhibiting enhanced glucose consumption associated with an aerobic glycolytic phenotype ( i.e. , the Warburg effect ) . We have previously demonstrated that myeloma cells exhibit constitutive plasma membrane ( PM ) localization of GLUT4 , consistent with the dependence of MM cells on this transporter for maintenance of glucose consumption rates , proliferative capacity , and viability . The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of constitutive GLUT4 plasma membrane localization in MM cells . FINDINGS We have elucidated a novel mechanism through which myeloma cells achieve constitutive GLUT4 activation involving elevated expression of the Rab-GTPase activating protein AS160_v2 splice variant to promote the Warburg effect . AS160_v2-positive MM cell lines display constitutive Thr642 phosphorylation , known to be required for inactivation of AS160 Rab-GAP activity . Importantly , we show that enforced expression of AS160_v2 is required for GLUT4 PM translocation and activation in these select MM lines . Furthermore , we demonstrate that ectopic expression of a full-length , phospho-deficient AS160 mutant is sufficient to impair constitutive GLUT4 cell surface residence , which is characteristic of MM cells . CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to tie AS160 de-regulation to increased glucose consumption rates and the Warburg effect in cancer . Future studies investigating connections between the insulin/IGF-1/AS160_v2/GLUT4 axis and FDG-PET positivity in myeloma patients are warranted and could provide rationale for therapeutically targeting this pathway in MM patients with advanced disease .	31	3
Loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) in 16q appears in cases of Wilms ' tumor . Within this region , known as common fragile site FRA16D , the WWOX tumor suppressor gene is located . Abnormalities of WWOX gene expression levels were observed in many tumor types and were associated with worse prognosis . The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the WWOX tumor suppressor gene in Wilms ' tumor samples . We evaluated the correlation between expression of WWOX and genes involved in proliferation ( Ki67 ) , apoptosis ( BCL2 , BAX ) , signal transduction ( ERBB4 , ERBB2 , EGFR ) , cell cycle ( CCNE1 , CCND1 ) , cell adhesion ( CDH1 ) and transcription ( TP73 ) using real-time RT-PCR in 23 tumor samples . We also analyzed the potential causes of WWOX gene expression reduction i.e. , promoter methylation status ( MethylScreen method ) and loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) status . We revealed a positive correlation between WWOX expression and BCL2 , BCL2/BAX ratio , EGFR , ERBB4 isoform JM-a , TP73 and negative correlation with both cyclins . Loss of heterozygosity of the WWOX gene was observed only at intron 8 , however , it had no influence on the reduction of its expression levels . Contrary to LOH , methylation of the region covering the 3 ' end of the promoter and part of exon 1 was associated with statistically significant reduction of WWOX gene expression levels . In the present study we reveal that in Wilms ' tumors the WWOX expression levels are positively associated with the process of apoptosis , signal transduction through the ErbB4 pathway and EGFR and negatively with the regulation of the cell cycle ( by cyclin E1 and D1 ) . Moreover , our analysis indicates that in this type of tumor the expression of the WWOX gene can be regulated by an epigenetic mechanism--its promoter methylation .	
Cancer cells typically display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference of aerobic glycolysis , known as the Warburg effect , which facilitates cell proliferation . Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) and oncoprotein Myc are two prominent transcription factors that drive glycolysis . Previously , we reported that the estrogen-related receptors ( ERRs ) act as cofactors of HIF and enhance HIF-dependent transcription of glycolytic genes under hypoxia . ERRs are orphan nuclear receptors and key regulators of energy metabolism by orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis , fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) and oxidative phosphorylation . Here , we show that ERRs also stimulate glycolysis under normoxia . ERRs directly bind to and activate promoters of many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes , and the ERR-binding sites in such promoters are essential for ERR-mediated transcriptional activation . ERRs interact with Myc , and the two factors synergistically activate transcription of glycolytic genes . Furthermore , overexpression of ERRs increases glycolytic gene expression and lactate production . Conversely , depletion of ERRs in cancer cells reduces expression of glycolytic genes and glucose uptake , resulting in decreased aerobic glycolysis and cell growth . Taken together , these results suggest that ERRs are important transcriptional activators of the glycolytic pathway and contribute to the Warburg effect in cancer cells .	9	93	31	3
In this study , laboratory experiments were carried out in order to come to a better understanding of the fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) in the marine environment and especially on their bioaccumulation , biotransformation and genotoxic effects in fish . Juveniles of turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ) were exposed to PAHs through different routes via ( 1 ) a mixture of dissolved PAHs , ( 2 ) a PAH-polluted sediment and ( 3 ) an oil fuel elutriate . Fish were exposed 4 days followed by a 6-day depuration period . In each experiment , PAH concentrations in the seawater of the tanks were analysed regularly by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry . Muscle and liver samples were also analysed for parent PAH levels and PAH bioconcentration factors were calculated . Biotransformation was evaluated by measuring the levels of PAH metabolites in fish bile . Genotoxicity was assessed by the alkaline comet assay . Regardless of exposure route , the parent PAH concentrations in the liver and muscle showed a peak level 1 day after the beginning of the exposure , followed by a decrease up to the background level towards the end of the experiment , except for the exposure to dissolved PAHs for which levels were relatively low throughout the study . As a consequence , no bioaccumulation was observed in fish tissues at the end of the experiment . In contrast , regardless of exposure routes , a rapid production of biliary metabolites was observed throughout the whole exposure experiment . This was especially true for 1-hydroxypyrene , the major metabolite of pyrene . After 6 days of recovery in clean water , a significant decrease in the total metabolite concentrations occurred in bile . Fish exposed through either route displayed a significant increase in DNA strand breaks after 4 days of exposure , and significant correlations were observed between the level of biliary PAH metabolites and the level of DNA lesions in fish erythrocytes . Overall results indicate that exposure to either a mixture of dissolved PAHs , a PAH-contaminated sediment or a dispersed oil fuel elutriate leads to biotransformation and increase in DNA damage in fish . The quantification of PAH metabolites in bile and DNA damage in erythrocytes appear to be suitable for environmental monitoring of marine pollution either in the case of accidental oil spills or sediment contamination .	612	61	6
It is well established that blocking the interaction of EGFR with growth factors leads to the arrest of tumor growth , resulting in tumor cell death . ER414 is a human monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) derived by guided selection of the mouse mAb A13 . The ER414 exhibited a lower affinity and , as a result , lower efficacy of inhibition of the EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR when compared with mAb A13 and cetuximab . We performed a stepwise in vitro affinity maturation to improve the affinity of ER414 . We obtained a 3D model of ER414 to identify the amino acids in the CDRs that needed to be mutated . Clones were selected from the phage library with randomized amino acids in the CDRs and substitution of amino acids in the HCDR3 and LCDR1 of ER414 led to improved affinity . A clone , H3-14 , with a increased affinity , was selected from the HCDR3 randomized library . Then three clones , ER2 , ER78 and ER79 , were selected from the LCDR1 randomized library based on the H3-14 but did not show further increased affinities compared to that of H3-14 . Of the three , ER2 was chosen for further characterization due to its better expression than others . We successfully performed affinity maturation of ER414 and obtained antibodies with a similar affinity as cetuximab . And antibody from an affinity maturation inhibits the EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in a manner similar to cetuximab .	
AIM The goal of this study was to characterize the AFP receptor , its possible signal transduction pathway and its proliferative functions in human hepatoma cell line Bel 7402 . METHODS Cell proliferation enhanced by AFP was detected by MTT assay , 3H-thymidine incorporation and S-stage percentage of cell cycle analysis . With radioactive labeled 125I-AFP for receptor binding assay ; cAMP accumulation , protein kinase A activity were detected by radioactive immunosorbent assay and the change of intracellular free calcium ( Ca2+i ) was monitored by scanning fluorescence intensity under TCS-NT confocal microscope . The expression of oncogenes N- ras , p 53 , and p21( ras ) in the cultured cells in vitro were detected by Northern blotting and Western blotting respectively . RESULTS It was demonstrated that AFP enhanced the proliferation of human hepatoma Bel 7402 cell in a dose dependent fashion as shown in MTT assay , ( 3)H-thymidine incorporation and S-phase percentage up to 2-fold . Two subtypes of AFP receptors were identified in the cells with Kds of 1.3 x 10(-9)mol.L(-1) and 9.9 x10(-8)mol . ( -1)L respectively . Pretreatment of cells with AFP resulted in a significant increase ( 625% ) in cAMP accumulation . The activity of protein kinase A activity were increased up to 37.5 , 122.6 , 73.7 and 61.2% at treatment time point 2 , 6 , 12 and 24 hours . The level of intracellular calcium were elevated after the treatment of alpha-fetoprotein and achieved to 204% at 4 min . The results also showed that AFP(20mg.L(-1)) could upregulate the expression of N- ras oncogenes and p 53 and p21( ras ) in Bel 7402 cells . In the later case,the alteration were 81.1%(12h) and 97.3%(12h) respectively compared with control . CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that AFP is a potential growth factor to promote the proliferation of human hepatoma Bel 7402 cells . Its growth-regulatory effects are mediated by its specific plasma membrane receptors coupled with its transmembrane signaling transduction through the pathway of cAMP-PKA and intracellular calcium to regulate the expression of oncogenes .	9	91	921	93	92
Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) and oxidative stress are closely linked . Oxidative stress affects many signaling pathways and may cause the induction of autophagy . The NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( Keap1 ) signaling pathway is the main pathway responsible for cell defense against oxidative stress and Nrf2 is a critical transcription factor related with cancer multidrug resistance . However , the relation between Nrf2 and regulation of autophagy is not well understood . In this study , we used temozolomide ( TMZ ) , which inhibited the viability of GBM cells mainly by inducing autophagic cell death and explored the role of Nrf2 downregulation on autophagy induced by TMZ in GBM cells . In U251-Si-Nrf2 48h after transfection the protein levels of Nrf2 were significantly downregulated , while the protein levels of LC3B-II increased by western blot analysis . Knockdown of Nrf2 also led to a significant increase of autophagic vacuoles and acidic vesicular organelles ( AVOs ) , revealed by trans-mission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and acridine orange ( AO ) staining using flow cytometry . Collectively , these findings demonstrate that knockdown of Nrf2 can enhance the basal level of autophagy in the U251 glioma cell line . Furthermore , after the treatment with TMZ ( 100µM ) for 3 days , the U251-Si-Nrf2 transfected cells showed less viability rate by cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay and the levels of autophagy increased obviously through analysis of western blot and AO staining using flow cytometry . Taken together , our results suggest that knockdown of Nrf2 may enhance autophagy induced by TMZ in the U251 glioma cell line , which should be further evaluated for novel anticancer activity .	82	8
The ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS ) promotes the timely degradation of short-lived proteins with key regulatory roles in a vast array of biological processes , such as cell cycle progression , oncogenesis and genome integrity . Thus , abnormal regulation of UPS disrupts the protein homeostasis and causes many human diseases , particularly cancer . Indeed , the FDA approval of bortezomib , the first class of general proteasome inhibitor , for the treatment of multiple myeloma , demonstrated that the UPS can be an attractive anti-cancer target . However , normal cell toxicity associated with bortezomib , resulting from global inhibition of protein degradation , promotes the focus of drug discovery efforts on targeting enzymes upstream of the proteasome for better specificity . E3 ubiquitin ligases , particularly those known to be activated in human cancer , become an attractive choice . Cullin-RING Ligases ( CRLs ) with multiple components are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and are responsible for ubiquitination of of cellular proteins degraded through UPS . Activity of CRLs is dynamically regulated and requires the RING component and cullin neddylation . In this review , we will introduce the UPS and CRL E3s and discuss the biological processes regulated by each of eight CRLs through substrate degradation . We will further discuss how cullin neddylation controls CRL activity , and how CRLs are being validated as the attractive cancer targets by abrogating the RING component through genetic means and by inhibiting cullin neddylation via MLN4924 , a small molecule indirect inhibitor of CRLs , currently in several Phase I clinical trials . Finally , we will discuss current efforts and future perspectives on the development of additional inhibitors of CRLs by targeting E2 and/or E3 of cullin neddylation and CRL-mediated ubiquitination as potential anti-cancer agents .	
HER-2/neu gene expression , DNA ploidy and proliferation index were studied in 250 cases of breast cancer . Expression of HER-2/neu was determined by using an antibody to the HER-2/neu receptor . Ki-67 antibody was used to determine the proliferation index of the breast cancers , and the Feulgen method was used to assess DNA amounts in the tumor cells . Histochemical staining was quantitated by image analysis . Of the cancers studied , 72 were positive for overexpression of HER-2/neu protein ; of these , 62 ( 86% ) possessed near-tetraploid DNA content , and 47 ( 65% ) had more than one G0G1 stem line ( polyploid ) of DNA distribution . Cells from the cases negative for HER/2-neu overexpression contained DNA amounts that ranged from diploid to varying degrees of aneuploid . A significant difference in the amounts of cellular proliferation in HER-2/neu overexpressing cancers was found between those that expressed the HER-2/neu receptor on their membranes and those that exhibited mainly cytoplasmic receptors .	9	93
The BLM helicase is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family and is mutated in the cancer-prone disorder Bloom syndrome . BLM plays a role in a number of cellular processes including DNA double-strand break repair , Holliday junction dissolution , and chromosome segregation . In Drosophila melanogaster , the BLM ortholog ( DmBlm ) is encoded by the mus309 gene . To study the role of DmBlm in double-strand break repair , we utilized a genetic assay in which a targeted DNA double-strand gap is created through excision of a P transposable element . By recovering and molecularly analyzing individual repair products from wild-type and mus309 male pre-meiotic germline cells , we demonstrated that the DmBlm helicase is involved in homologous recombination downstream of strand invasion . This assay can be adapted to test the roles of numerous DNA metabolic factors in DNA double-strand gap repair .	62	6
P53 has an important role in the processing of starvation signals . P53-dependent molecular mediators of the Warburg effect reduce glucose consumption and promote mitochondrial function . We therefore hypothesized that the retention of wild-type p53 characteristic of primary glioblastomas limits metabolic demands induced by deregulated signal transduction in the presence of hypoxia and nutrient depletion . Here we report that short hairpin RNA-mediated gene suppression of wild-type p53 or ectopic expression of mutant temperature-sensitive dominant-negative p53(V135A) increased glucose consumption and lactate production , decreased oxygen consumption and enhanced hypoxia-induced cell death in p53 wild-type human glioblastoma cells . Similarly , genetic knockout of p53 in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells resulted in reduced respiration and hypersensitivity towards hypoxia-induced cell death . Further , wild-type p53 gene silencing reduced the expression of synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 ( SCO2 ) , an effector necessary for respiratory chain function . An SCO2 transgene reverted the metabolic phenotype and restored resistance towards hypoxia in p53-depleted and p53 mutant glioma cells in a rotenone-sensitive manner , demonstrating that this effect was dependent on intact oxidative phosphorylation . Supplementation with methyl-pyruvate , a mitochondrial substrate , rescued p53 wild-type but not p53 mutant cells from hypoxic cell death , demonstrating a p53-mediated selective aptitude to metabolize mitochondrial substrates . Further , SCO2 gene silencing in p53 wild-type glioma cells sensitized these cells towards hypoxia . Finally , lentiviral gene suppression of SCO2 significantly enhanced tumor necrosis in a subcutaneous HCT116 xenograft tumor model , compatible with impaired energy metabolism in these cells . These findings demonstrate that glioma and colon cancer cells with p53 wild-type status can skew the Warburg effect and thereby reduce their vulnerability towards tumor hypoxia in an SCO2-dependent manner . Targeting SCO2 may therefore represent a valuable strategy to enhance sensitivity towards hypoxia and may complement strategies targeting glucose metabolism .	31	3
We present a novel gain-of-function mutation of TGF-β receptor II ( TβRII ) found in human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . Expression of E221V/N238I mutant TβRII enhanced TGF-β signaling . Mutation of TβRII conferred cells higher migratory and invasive capabilities and MMP-2 activity . In mouse tumor model , mutant tumors exhibited poor differentiation and E-cadherin relocalization to the cytosol . Lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis of TβRII was attenuated in mutant TβRII , suggesting that enhancement of TGF-β signaling by this mutation is due to delayed TβRII internalization . Taken together , our results show a novel gain-of-function TβRII mutation , which enhances TGF-β signaling leading to more invasive phenotypic changes in human OSCC .	11	1	63	6	9	93
The homodimeric bc(1) complexes are membrane proteins essential in respiration and photosynthesis . The distance between the two b(L)-hemes of the dimer opens the possibility of electron transfer between them , but contradictory reports make such inter-monomer electron transfer controversial . We have constructed in Rhodobacter sphaeroides a heterodimeric expression system similar to those used before , in which the bc(1) complex can be mutated differentially in the two copies of cyt b to test for inter-monomer electron transfer , but found that genetic recombination by cross-over then occurs to produce wild-type homodimer . Selection pressure under photosynthetic growth always favored the homodimer over heterodimeric variants enforcing inter-monomer electron transfer , showing that the latter are not competitive . These results , together with kinetic analysis of myxothiazol titrations , demonstrate that inter-monomer electron transfer does not occur at rates competitive with monomeric turnover . We examine the results from other groups interpreted as demonstrating rapid inter-monomer electron transfer , conclude that similar mechanisms are likely to be in play , and suggest that such claims might need to be re-examined .	
Given the important role of CXCR4 in cancer metastasis , microenvironmental factors that modulate CXCR4 may have an impact on the process of tumor expansion . Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and a significant microenvironmental factor that drives aggressive behavior . CXCR4 is upregulated in several cancer cells under hypoxic conditions , suggesting a relationship between tumor hypoxia and CXCR4 . However , the role of hypoxia in regulating CXCR4 in gastric cancer remains poorly understood . KATO III gastric cancer cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia . CXCR4 expression in cells transfected with shRNA specific for HIF-1α was investigated by western blotting and flow cytometry . Wound healing , migration and invasion assays were used to assess cell motility and the chemotactic response to CXCL12 , a major CXCR4 ligand . CXCR4 expression at the protein level and in the cell membrane was significantly increased in KATOIII cells following exposure to hypoxia . This upregulation of CXCR4 was implicated in increased cell motility and enhanced chemotactic responses ( migration and invasion ) to CXCL12 treatment in vitro . The increases in CXCR4 expression and metastatic potential in gastric cancer cells exposed to hypoxia were blocked by HIF-1α-specific shRNA . Our results indicate that hypoxia upregulates CXCR4 in gastric cancer cells in a HIF-1α-dependent manner , and that upregulation of CXCR4 plays a role in cancer cell migration and invasion . Thus , disrupting the hypoxia-HIF-1α-CXCR4 axis could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer .	11	1	12
BACKGROUND : It is unclear whether distinct weight-related trajectory classes , differing in course , demographics , and health characteristics , exist in the elderly population . METHODS : Data came from the 10-year ( 1986-1996 ) Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly study of 3,861 black ( 54% ) and white ( 46% ) participants aged 65-105 years . Latent-class trajectories of body mass index ( BMI : kg/m(2) ) based on self-reported weight and height at baseline , 3 , 6 , and 10 years later were determined using generalized mixture models . Polytomous logistic regression was used to identify baseline demographic and health characteristics that distinguished the trajectories , and 10-year postbaseline data to confirm the findings . RESULTS : We identified three trajectories : normal weight ( BMI 27.6% of the sample ) , overweight ( BMI 65.1% ) , and obese ( BMI 7.3% ) . Demographic characteristics distinguished the three trajectories : highest odds of blacks , women , and less education in the obese trajectory , lowest in the normal-weight trajectory . Obese and overweight differed adversely from normal-weight trajectories , but not significantly from each other on cognitive impairment , hypertension , and diabetes . Depressive symptomatology was more prevalent in the obese ; they were also younger . There was no association with cancer or heart disease . CONCLUSION : Distinct trajectories and course of BMI were present in this older population . Weight loss increased with increase in BMI class . Although demographic characteristics distinguished all trajectory classes , adverse health characteristics distinguished the overweight and obese classes from the normal-weight class , but not from each other . Problems associated with education and health are present at study entry and should be addressed earlier in life .	
The solution structure of the complex of enzyme IIA of the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose ( Chb ) transporter with the histidine phosphocarrier protein HPr has been solved by NMR . The IIA(Chb)-HPr complex completes the structure elucidation of representative cytoplasmic complexes for all four sugar branches of the bacterial phosphoryl transfer system ( PTS ) . The active site His-89 of IIA(Chb) was mutated to Glu to mimic the phosphorylated state . IIA(Chb)(H89E) and HPr form a weak complex with a K(D) of mM . The interacting binding surfaces , concave for IIA(Chb) and convex for HPr , complement each other in terms of shape , residue type , and charge distribution , with predominantly hydrophobic residues , interspersed by some uncharged polar residues , located centrally , and polar and charged residues at the periphery . The active site histidine of HPr , His-15 , is buried within the active site cleft of IIA(Chb) formed at the interface of two adjacent subunits of the IIA(Chb) trimer , thereby coming into close proximity with the active site residue , H89E , of IIA(Chb) . A His89-P-His-15 pentacoordinate phosphoryl transition state can readily be modeled without necessitating any significant conformational changes , thereby facilitating rapid phosphoryl transfer . Comparison of the IIA(Chb)-HPr complex with the IIA(Chb)-IIB(Chb) complex , as well as with other cytoplasmic complexes of the PTS , highlights a unifying mechanism for recognition of structurally diverse partners . This involves generating similar binding surfaces from entirely different underlying structural elements , large interaction surfaces coupled with extensive redundancy , and side chain conformational plasticity to optimize diverse sets of intermolecular interactions .	
Heat shock protein 27 ( Hsp27 ) is emerging as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of various cancers . Although the role of Hsp27 in protection from stress-induced intrinsic cell death has been relatively well studied , its role in Fas ( death domain containing member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily)-induced apoptosis and cell proliferation remains underappreciated . Here , we show that Hsp27 silencing induces dual coordinated effects , resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation and sensitization of cells to Fas-induced apoptosis through regulation of PEA-15 ( 15-kDa phospho-enriched protein in astrocytes ) . We demonstrate that Hsp27 silencing suppresses proliferation by causing PEA-15 to bind and sequester extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , resulting in reduced translocation of ERK to the nucleus . Concurrently , Hsp27 silencing promotes Fas-induced apoptosis by inducing PEA-15 to release Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain ( FADD ) , thus allowing FADD to participate in death receptor signaling . Conversely , Hsp27 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and suppresses Fas-induced apoptosis . Furthermore , we show that Hsp27 regulation of PEA-15 activity occurs in an Akt-dependent manner . Significantly , Hsp27 silencing in a panel of phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) wild-type or null cell lines , and in LNCaP cells that inducibly express PTEN , resulted in selective growth inhibition of PTEN-deficient cancer cells . These data identify a dual coordinated role of Hsp27 in cell proliferation and Fas-induced apoptosis via Akt and PEA-15 , and indicate that improved clinical responses to Hsp27-targeted therapy may be achieved by stratifying patient populations based on tumor PTEN expression .	9	81	8
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ( 1,25D ) , the hormonal form of vitamin D , and several analogs have failed as monotherapies for cancer because of poor efficacy or acquired resistance . However , 1,25D analogs are amenable to bifunctionalization . Preclinical studies have revealed combinatorial effects of 1,25D analogs and histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ) . Secosteroidal hybrid molecules combining vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) agonism with HDACi displayed enhanced efficacy but are laborious to synthesize . Here , we have developed easily assembled , fully integrated , non-secosteroidal VDR agonist/HDACi hybrids . The most promising are full VDR agonists with lower potency than 1,25D . Structure/function studies revealed that antiproliferative activity against 1,25D-resistant squamous carcinoma cells required VDR agonism and HDACi . Remarkably , modeling and X-ray crystallography reveal non-secosteroidal hybrids bind in the VDR ligand binding domain in the opposite orientation of their secosteroidal counterparts .	
RKIP-1 is a metastasis suppressor that is frequently downregulated in aggressive cancers . However , the consequences of RKIP loss in primary or immortalized cells have not yet been explored . Using HEK-293 RKIP depleted ( termed HEK-499 ) and Flp-In T-Rex-293 RKIP inducible cell lines combined with whole transcriptome analysis , we show that RKIP-1 silencing accelerates DNA synthesis and G1/S transition entry by inducing the expression of cdc6 , MCM 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , cdc45L , cyclin D2 , cyclin E2 , cyclin D1 , SKP2 and the downregulation of p21(cip1) . Moreover , RKIP depletion accelerates the time from nuclear envelop breakdown ( NEB ) to anaphase markedly , while the upregulation of RKIP shortened the NEB to anaphase time . We show that RKIP depletion induces the expression of NEK6 , a molecule known to enhance G2/M transition , and down-regulates G2/M checkpoint molecules like Aurora B , cyclin G1 and sertuin that slow the G2/M transition time . These subtle changes in the kinetics of the cell cycle culminate in a higher proliferation rate of HEK-499 compared to control cells . Finally , we show that RKIP depletion enhances cellular motility by inducing the expression/stabilization of β-catenin , vimentin , MET and PAK1 . Overall , our data suggest that modulation of the cell cycle checkpoints and motility by RKIP may be fundamental to its metastasis suppressive function in cancer and that RKIP role in a cell is more intricate and diverse than previously thought .	91	1	12	9
In an attempt to find a strategy to modulate the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells , we examined whether constitutive activation of proto-oncogen protein p21 ( Ras ) induced the reentry of confluent human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) into the S phase . When an adenovirus construct expressing a constitutively active Ras mutant ( Ad/RasG12V ) was infected into HUVECs , their morphology changed strikingly and they appeared to be transformed . However , Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs did not enter the S phase , as determined by assessing 3H-thymidine incorporation . In accordance with the above results , the expression of cyclin A both at the transcript and protein levels did not increase in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs relative to that in control cells , although the expression of cyclin D1 was induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected cells . Interestingly , the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21cip1 was remarkably increased while that of p27kip1 did not decrease in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs . Furthermore , CDK2 activity was not induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs . These results suggested that the constitutive activation of Ras promoted the reentry of confluent HUVECs in the G0 phase into the G1 phase , but not into the S phase . The results also indicated that the constitutive activation of Ras might have induced the persistent expression of p21cip1 and p27kip1 , and that this induction of p21cip1 and p27kip1 expression possibly caused the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase .	9	51	511	5	91
PURPOSE The cytotoxic effect of the combination treatment of TNF-alpha and hyperthermia on L929 and TNF-alpha-resistant L929 ( rL929 ) cells was investigated . MATERIALS AND METHODS L929 cells were treated with TNF-alpha ( 5 ng/mL ) , heating at 43 degrees C or the combination of TNF-alpha and heating . The cells were harvested at different time within the 24-hour period . The viability and the type of cell death of the harvested cells were examined . RESULTS When L929 cells were treated with a combination of TNF-alpha and heating the cells died quickly and apoptosis increased to an overwhelming extent , especially in the group pre-treated with TNF-alpha for 1 h prior to heating . Although rL929 cells were resistant to TNF-alpha alone , the cells became sensitive to TNF-alpha treatment when combined with heating . Similar to the L929 cell , the cells also died rapidly and exhibited apoptosis to a higher extent . Using an Annexin-V-FITC kit and flow cytometer , we found that both necrosis and apoptosis occurred . Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from treated cells showed that the DNA fragments were multiples of approximately 200 bp . Furthermore , by studying the kinetics of cell death and apoptosis , we found that the loss of cell membrane integrity preceded the DNA fragmentation in both L929 and rL929 cells . CONCLUSION The results suggested that hyperthermia may enhance the necrotic and apoptotic effects of TNF-alpha on some tumour cells and overcome the resistance of some tumour cells to TNF-alpha .	83	81	8
INTRODUCTION During selective segregation of DNA , a cell asymmetrically divides and retains its template DNA . Asymmetric division yields daughter cells whose genome reflects that of the parents ' , simultaneously protecting the parental cell from genetic errors that may occur during DNA replication . We hypothesized that long-lived epithelial cells are present in immortal , premalignant cell populations , undergo asymmetric division , retain their template DNA strands , and cycle both during allometric growth and during pregnancy . METHODS The glands of 3-week old immune competent Balb/C female mice were utilized intact or cleared of host epithelium and implanted with ductal-limited , lobule-limited , or alveolar-ductal progenitor cells derived from COMMA-D1 pre-malignant epithelial cells. 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ( 5-BrdU ) was administered to identify those cells which retain their template DNA . Nulliparous mice were then either injected with [ (3)H]-thymidine ( (3)H-TdR ) to distinguish 5-BrdU-label retaining cells that enter the cell cycle and euthanized , or mated , injected with ( 3)H-TdR , and euthanized at various days post-coitus . Sections were stained for estrogen receptor-α(ER-α) or progesterone receptor ( PR ) via immunohistochemistry . Cells labelled with both 5-BrdU and ( 3)H-TdR were indicative of label-retaining epithelial cells ( LREC ) . RESULTS Cells that retained a 5-BrdU label and cells labelled with [ (3)H]-thymidine were found in all mice and were typically detected along the branching epithelium of mature mouse mammary glands . Cells containing double-labelled nuclei ( LREC ) were found in the intact mammary gland of both pregnant and nulliparous mice , and in mammary glands implanted with pre-malignant cells . Double-labelled cells ( (3)H-TdR/5-BrdU ) represent a small portion of cells in the mammary gland that cycle and retain their template DNA ( 5-BrdU ) . Some label-retaining cells were also ER-α or PR positive . LRECs distributed their second label ( (3)H-TdR ) to daughter cells ; and this effect persisted during pregnancy . LRECs , and small focal hyperplasia , were found in all immortalized premalignant mammary implant groups . CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that a subpopulation of long-lived , label-retaining epithelial cells ( LRECs ) is present in immortal premalignant cell populations . These LRECs persist during pregnancy , retain their original DNA , and a small percentage express ER-α and PR . We speculate that LRECs in premalignant hyperplasia represent the long-lived ( memory ) cells that maintain these populations indefinitely .	9	93
Many cancer cells metabolize glucose preferentially via pyruvate to lactate instead to CO(2) and H(2)O ( oxidative phosphorylation ) even in the presence of oxygen ( Warburg effect ) . Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) is a drug which is able to shift pyruvate metabolism from lactate to acetyl-CoA ( tricarboxylic acid cycle ) by indirect activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) . This can subsequently lead to an increased flow of oxygen in the respiratory chain , associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) which may cause apoptosis . In order to investigate if DCA may be suitable for neuroblastoma therapy , it was investigated on three human neuroblastoma cell lines whether DCA can reduce lactate production and enhance oxygen consumption . The data show , that DCA ( in the low millimolar range ) is able to reduce lactate production , but there was only a slight shift to increased oxygen consumption and almost no effect on cell vitality , proliferation and apoptosis of the three cell lines investigated . Therefore , DCA at low millimolar concentrations seems to be only of minor efficacy for neuroblastoma treatment .	8	3	81
The mechanisms by which tumour cells metastasize and the role that cell polarity proteins play in this process are not well understood . We report that partitioning defective protein 3 ( Par3 ) is dysregulated in metastasis in human breast cancer , and is associated with a higher tumour grade and ErbB2-positive status . Downregulation of Par3 cooperated with ErbB2 to induce cell invasion and metastasis in vivo . Interestingly , the metastatic behaviour was not associated with an overt mesenchymal phenotype . However , loss of Par3 inhibited E-cadherin junction stability , disrupted membrane and actin dynamics at cell-cell junctions and decreased cell-cell cohesion in a manner dependent on the Tiam1/Rac-GTP pathway . Inhibition of this pathway restored E-cadherin junction stability and blocked invasive behaviour of cells lacking Par3 , suggesting that loss of Par3 promotes metastatic behaviour of ErbB2-induced tumour epithelial cells by decreasing cell-cell cohesion .	1	12
A common metabolic change in cancer is the acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes . Increased expression of glycolytic enzymes is considered as one contributing factor . The role of mitochondrial defects in acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes has been postulated but remains controversial . Here we show that functional defects in mitochondrial respiration could be induced by oncogenic H-Ras(Q61L) transformation , even though the mitochondrial contents or mass was not reduced in the transformed cells . First , mitochondrial respiration , as measured by mitochondrial oxygen consumption , was suppressed in NIH-3T3 cells transformed with H-Ras(Q61L) . Second , oligomycin or rotenone did not reduce the cellular ATP levels in the H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells , suggesting a diminished role of mitochondrial respiration in the cellular energy metabolism . Third , inhibition of glycolysis with iodoacetic acid reduced ATP levels at a much faster rate in H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells than in the vector control cells . The reduction of cellular ATP levels was reversed by exogenously added pyruvate in the vector control cells but not in H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells . Finally when compared to the HRas(Q61L) transformed cells , the vector control cells had increased resistance toward glucose deprivation . The increased resistance was dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation since rotenone or oligomycin abolished the increased survival of the vector control cells under glucose deprivation . The results also suggest an inability of the H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells to reactivate mitochondrial respiration under glucose deprivation . Taken together , the data suggest that mitochondrial respiration can be impaired during transformation of NIH-3T3 cells by oncogeneic H-Ras(Q61L) .	31	3
Phyllanthus urinaria is widely used as anti-inflammatory , antiviral , antibacterial , and anti-hepatotoxic medicines in almost every tropical country . However , scientific evidence supporting its use in cancer metastasis is limited , particularly osteosarcoma . We investigated the effect of P. urinaria extract ( PUE ) on cell viability , invasion , and migration in the human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell line , and looked at the impact of PUE on several relevant proteases and signaling pathways . This study demonstrates that PUE , at a range of concentrations ( from 0 to 100 μg/ml ) , concentration-dependently inhibited the migration/invasion capacities of Saos-2 without cytotoxic effects . Zymographic and western blot analyses revealed that PUE inhibited the urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( u-PA ) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) enzyme activity , as well as protein expression . Western blot analysis also showed that PUE inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt . Testing of mRNA level , quantitative real-time PCR , and promoter assays evaluated the inhibitory effects of PUE on u-PA expression in Saos-2 cells . The chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay was reactive to the transcription protein SP-1 , which was inhibited by PUE . In conclusion , PUE suppresses human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell invasion and migration by transcriptionally inhibiting u-PA via ERK and Akt signaling pathways . Therefore , PUE produces anti-metastatic activity in Saos-2 cells .	11	1	12
To search for potential biomarkers used to monitor the process of immortalization , we investigated the relative level of telomerase activity and other immortal phenotypes in the SHEE esophageal epithelial cell line . This human fetal esophageal epithelial cell line , induced by human papilloma virus ( HPV ) 18 E6E7 , was continually propagated over 100 passages . Fourteenth passage cells ( SHEE14 ) were cultured in a flask with a serum-free medium and continually cultured to the 30th passage ( SHEE30 ) . Cells of SHEE14 , SHEE20 and SHEE30 were examined according to cell morphology , cell cycle , apoptosis , contact-inhibition growth , anchorage- dependency , dose-dependency to epithelial growth factors ( EGF ) , telomerase activity and tumorigenicity . The SHEE14 cells exhibited good differentiation with contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . The SHEE20 cells exhibited increase of senescent and apoptotic cells , and difficulty in propagation . The SHEE30 cells exhibited a higher proliferative index and some undifferentiated cells , with weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . The telomerase was activated in cells of SHEE30 , but not in SHEE14 and SHEE20 cells . The different response to dose-dependency to EGF was not statistically different in SHEE14 and SHEE30 . Three groups of cells displayed lack of tumor formation in nude mice . Compared with SHEE14 and SHEE20 , SHEE30 cells were of immortalized status with immortal phenotype , which consisted of telomerase activity , increase of cell proliferation , weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth , dose dependency to EGF and lack of tumor formation . From passage 14 to 30th passage , SHEE cells went through cellular senescence , apoptosis and immortalization . With a view toward diagnostic and biological aspects , telomerase activity is a crucial step and a cardinal requirement for immortalization . The telomerase activity and other immortal phenotypes are potential markers for monitoring the process of immortalization .	41	42	52	5	4	8	81
BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatocytes are considered an exception of the paradigmatic inverse correlation between cell proliferation and terminal differentiation . In fact , hepatic vital functions are guaranteed by proliferating parenchymal cells during liver regeneration . However , a fine molecular characterization of the relationship between proliferation and differentiation in hepatocytes has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vivo or in vitro models . METHODS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program was characterized in the immortalized , untransformed and differentiated hepatocytic cell line MMH , using several techniques . Particularly , two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis combined to tandem mass spectrometry proteomic approach was used . Cell cycle and cell adhesion properties of MMH have been altered using either myc-overexpression and MEK1/2 inhibition or a constitutive active beta-catenin mutant , respectively . RESULTS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program is stimulated by the exit from the cell cycle induced by cell-cell contact . Comparative proteomic analysis of proliferating versus quiescent hepatocytes validated the importance of contact inhibition , identifying 68 differently expressed gene products , representing 49 unique proteins . Notably , enzymes involved in important liver functions such as detoxification processes , lipid metabolism , iron and vitamin A storage and secretion , anti-inflammatory response and exocytosis were found significantly up-regulated in quiescent hepatocytes . Finally , we found that : ( i ) cell cycle arrest induced by MEK1/2 inhibition is not sufficient to induce hepatic product expression ; ( ii ) constitutive activation of beta-catenin counteracts the contact inhibition-induced terminal differentiation . CONCLUSION The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program requires a quiescent state maintained by cell-cell contact through the E-cadherin/beta-catenin pathway , rather than the inhibition of proliferation .	5	52
Autophagy is a catabolic process by which a cell degrades its intracellular materials to replenish itself . Induction of autophagy under various cellular stress stimuli can lead to either cell survival or cell death via apoptotic and/or autophagic ( nonapoptotic ) pathways . The NSAID sulindac sulfide induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells . Here , we show that inhibition of autophagy under serum-deprived conditions resulted in significant reductions of sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis in HT-29 colon cancer cells . In contrast , inhibition of autophagy under conditions where serum is available significantly increased sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells . We previously showed that the apoptosis inhibitor , survivin , plays a role in regulating NSAID-induced apoptosis and autophagic cell death . Here , we show that survivin protein half-life is increased in the presence of autophagy inhibitors under serum-deprived conditions , but not under conditions when serum is available . Thus , the increased levels of survivin may be a factor contributing to inhibition of sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis under serum-deprived conditions . These results suggest that whether a cell lives or dies due to autophagy induction depends on the balance of factors that regulate both autophagic and apoptotic processes .	82	81	8
The effects of deoxycholic acid ( DCA ) and ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) on 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP)-induced aberrant crypt foci ( ACF ) in the rat colon were examined . The effect of these bile acids on DNA adduct formation by PhIP in the colon was then analyzed , since the main action of PhIP is the formation of DNA adducts and subsequent gene mutations . For the ACF study , male F344 rats were administered PhIP-HCl ( 75 mg/kg , 10 doses ) by gavage , and a diet containing bile acid ( 0.4% DCA or UDCA ) was provided from 3 days before the first dose of PhIP for 8 weeks . The mean number of ACF per colon of DCA , UDCA and controls were 9.9 , 2.4 and 5.5 , respectively . The ACF number was significantly increased by DCA and decreased by UDCA ( P<0.001 ) . To examine the effect of bile acids on DNA adduct formation , male F344 rats were fed a diet supplemented with bile acids ( 0.1 or 0.4% of DCA and UDCA ) 7 days prior to the PhIP administration . All rats were administered a single dose of PhIP-HCl ( 50 mg/kg ) by gavage and sacrificed 48 hours later . DNA adduct levels of the 0.1% UDCA , 0.1% DCA and controls were 2.93 ( adducts/10(7) nucleotides ) , 2.65 and 1.10 , respectively . Those of 0.4% UDCA , 0.4% DCA and controls were 1.64 , 1.30 and 1.00 , respectively . The PhIP-DNA adduct level was significantly increased by administration of 0.1% UDCA , 0.1% DCA ( P<0.05 ) and 0.4% UDCA ( P<0.01 ) . The increasing effect of both DCA and UDCA on PhIP-induced DNA adduct formation was unexpected , and was not directly associated with ACF formation .	61	611	6
Retinoic acid ( RA)-induced differentiation therapy is partially successful in neuroblastoma treatment . We found that a novel combination of vanadium-based PTP inhibitors with RA induced extensive differentiation in neuroblastoma cells . In contrast to RA alone , this led to either permanent differentiation or senescence after 14days of combined treatment followed by chemical removal . Senescence was dependent in part on synergistic AKT and ERK activation. p21 was also strongly induced , but in contrast to oncogene-induced senescence , p53 was not activated . Vanadium-based inhibitors thus serve strongly to enhance RA's ability to drive differentiation and a novel form of senescence in neuroblastoma cells .	42	4
This article describes the leading steps to develop an assay of DNA damage for the marine amphipod Gammarus locusta , using agarose gel electrophoresis ( AGE ) . To test the sensitivity and feasibility of the AGE technique , X-ray assays were performed with naked DNA and with live amphipods . These positive controls demonstrated the effectiveness of the AGE technique to not only discriminate distinct levels of DNA strand breakage in a dose-dependent manner , but also to identify and quantify the type of strand breakage induced . It was also shown that it is possible to detect DNA damage using whole-body DNA extracts from amphipods . To explore the potential of this technique for use in ecotoxicological studies with amphipods , a 96-h waterborne-copper toxicity test was performed . Copper-induced DNA strand breakage was first observed after 24 h of exposure , and was recorded again at 96 h , at a copper concentration of 20 microg l(-1) . The absence of strand breakage after 48 h of exposure is discussed in the light of the underlying mechanisms of copper toxicity and DNA repair . These studies demonstrated the feasibility of including DNA damage as a biomarker in ecotoxicological studies with amphipods . Information gained from the use of this biomarker would help with the interpretation of chronic toxicity tests and would contribute to our understanding of the impact of genotoxic insult in marine invertebrates , particularly crustaceans .	612	61	62	6
BACKGROUND Intracystic papillary carcinoma ( IPC ) of the breast is a rare form of noninvasive breast cancer . An appreciation of associated pathology with IPC may be critical in surgical decision-making . METHODS The medical records of all patients with IPC treated between 1985 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed . Three patient groups were identified according to the pathologic features of the primary tumor : IPC alone , IPC with associated ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) , and IPC with associated invasion with or without DCIS . Types of treatment and outcomes were compared between groups . RESULTS Forty patients were treated for IPC during the study period . Fourteen had pure IPC , 13 had IPC with DCIS , and 13 had IPC with invasion . The incidence of recurrence and the likelihood of dying of IPC did not differ between the three groups regardless of the type of surgery ( mastectomy or segmental mastectomy ) performed and whether radiation therapy was administered . The disease-specific survival rate was 100% . CONCLUSIONS When IPC is identified , it is frequently associated with DCIS and or invasion . Standard therapy should be based on associated pathology . The role of radiation therapy in pure IPC remains to be determined .	11	1
