12055053	Some polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners are CYP1A1 inducers , and induction of this enzyme in the placenta has been linked to adverse effects on fetal development . The objective of this study was to determine if the body burden of PCBs is related to placental CYP1A1 activity in Inuit women from Nunavik ( northern QuÃ©bec ) , a population highly exposed to organochlorines . Placenta and cord blood samples were obtained from 35 Inuit women and 30 women from a southern QuÃ©bec community exposed to background levels of organochlorines . We measured PCB concentrations in all cord plasma samples and in a subset of placenta samples from the Nunavik group and assessed CYP1A1 activity ( ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase ; EROD ) in placental microsomes from all participants . Concentrations of PCBs in cord plasma were strongly correlated to those in placenta ( Pearson's r ) = 0.77-0.97 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) and were on average 4-fold higher in Inuit women than in southern QuÃ©bec women [ for PCB 153 , the geometric means ( geometric SDs ) were 83.3 ( 1.9 ) ng/g lipid vs. 16.9 ( 1.6 ) ng/g lipid , respectively ] . Despite this difference in PCB body burden , both study groups had similar EROD activities when data were stratified according to tobacco smoking . Although simple correlation analysis first showed that placental EROD activity was correlated with PCB 153 plasma concentration in the Nunavik group , a multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate a significant contribution of PCBs to EROD activity when tobacco smoking was included in the analysis . We conclude that dietary exposure to PCBs in Inuit women from Nunavik does not significantly influence EROD activity in the placenta , implicating tobacco smoking as the major modulating factor .	11 12 1113 1 122 111 126
9831546	++Epidemiologic studies have focused attention on the health effects of fine particulate air pollutants &lt;2.5 microm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) . To further characterize the potential effects of fine particles , we investigated the relationship of air pollution to mortality in Mexico City during 1993-1995 . The concentration of PM2.5 was measured on a 24-hr integrated basis ; concentrations of NO2 and ozone were measured hourly and reduced to 24-hr means . Daily mortality was determined from death registration records , and Poisson regression was used to model daily death counts as a function of air pollutant levels on the same and previous days , while controlling for temperature and periodic cycles . Without taking other air pollutants into account , a 10 microg/m3 increase in the level of PM2.5 was associated with a 1.4% increase in total mortality , both on the current day and 4 days after exposure [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.2-2.5 ] . An equivalent increase in PM2.5 was also associated with somewhat larger excesses of deaths among people over 65 years of age and from cardiovascular and respiratory causes , which occurred after a lag of 4 days . The mean concentration of ozone over a 2-day period was associated with a 1.8% increase in mortality from cardiovascular diseases . NO2 was not consistently related to mortality . Fine particles had an independent effect on mortality when modeled simultaneously with other pollutants , and the association of ozone with cardiovascular mortality was strengthened after adjusting for NO2 and PM2.5 . These results support previous findings that urban air pollution at current levels leads to excess mortality and suggest that fine particles may play a causal role in producing that excess .	2 231 23
24131617	BACKGROUND Workers on coke oven plants may be exposed to potentially carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , particularly during work on the ovens tops . Two cohorts , employees of National Smokeless Fuels ( NSF ) and the British Steel Corporation ( BSC ) totalling more than 6,600 British coke plant workers employed in 1967 , had been followed up to mid-1987 for mortality . Previous analyses suggested an excess in lung cancer risk of around 25% , or less when compared with Social Class IV ( 'partly skilled').Analyses based on internal comparisons within the cohorts identified statistical associations with estimates of individual exposures , up to the start of follow-up , to benzene-soluble materials ( BSM ) , widely used as a metric for mixtures of PAHs . Some associations were also found with times spent in certain coke ovens jobs with specific exposure scenarios , but results were not consistent across the two cohorts and limitations in the exposure estimates were noted . The present study was designed to reanalyse the existing data on lung cancer mortality , incorporating revised and improved exposure estimates to BSM and to benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) , including increments during the follow-up and a lag for latency . METHODS Mean annual average concentrations of both BSM and B[a]P were estimated by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) from concentration measurements at all NSF and six BSC plants , and summarised by job and plant , with a temporal trend ( for the BSM only ) . These were combined with subjects ' work histories , to produce exposure estimates in each year of follow-up , with a 10-year lag to allow for latency . Exposures to BSM and to B[a]P were sufficiently uncorrelated to permit analysis in relation to each variable separately.Lung cancer death risks during the follow-up were analysed in relation to the estimated time-dependent exposures , both continuous and grouped , using Cox regression models , with adjustment for age . RESULTS Changing the exposure estimates changed the estimated relative risks compared with earlier results , but the new analyses showed no significant trends with continuous measures of exposure to either BSM or B[a]P , nor with time spent on ovens tops . Analyses with grouped exposures showed mixed results . Across all BSC plants , the relative risk coefficient for working 5 or more years on ovens tops , where the exposures were highest , was 1.81 , which was statistically significant . However , results for those with 0-5 years on ovens tops did not suggest a trend ; the evidence for an underlying relationship was thus suggestive but not strong . CONCLUSIONS The new results are in line with previous findings ; they show some signs consistent with an effect of coke ovens work on lung cancer risk , especially on ovens tops , but the preponderant absence of significant results , and the inconsistencies between results for NSF and BSC , highlight how little evidence there is in these data of any effect .	2 232 23
9514039	Mercury ( Hg ) , lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) and copper ( Cu ) in hair samples from Singapore island ( 85 samples ) and two islands off Batam , Indonesia ( 68 samples ) were analysed to assess the environmental uptake of elements . Hair samples were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath , rinsed five times with de-ionized water and air dried . Ten to 20 mg of hair samples were digested with 1 ml of ultra-pure concentrated nitric acid in Parr bombs at 120 degrees C for 2 h . Hair digests were analysed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry ( AAS ) . Hg was determined by the cold vapour AAS method and Pb , Cd and Cu by the electro-thermal graphite furnace AAS method . For Singapore hair , the contents of Cd ( in microgram/g ) averaged 0.17 ( range 0.02-1.81 ) ; Cu 13.2 ( range 3.1-70.1 ) ; Hg 5.92 ( range 1.14-35.52 ) ; and Pb 6.74 ( range 0.06-107.8 ) . For the islands off Batam , Cd was 0.32 ( range 0.06-1.80 ) ; Cu 21.1 ( range 3.8-143.6 ) ; Hg 5.59 ( range 0.78-60.86 ) ; and Pb 15.1 ( range 0.13-116.6 ) . Statistically significant differences in Cd , Pb and Hg contents were observed between the hair samples from Singapore and those of the islands off Batam in cumulative logit analysis . Hair from Singapore contained more Hg , but less Cd and Pb compared to hair from the islands off Batam . For Pb in hair , significant differences were also observed between the two islands off Batam ( island 1 , 18.9 ; and island 2 , 10.2 ) . These differences in hair metal contents are due to differences in community lifestyle ( dietary , environmental or occupational intake ) .	1 123 12
23434727	BACKGROUND Previous U.S. population modeling studies have reported that urinary cadmium ( Cd ) excretion patterns differ with age , sex , and dietary exposure ; associations between Cd exposures and health outcomes also have differed by age and sex . Therefore , it is important to test models used to estimate Cd exposures across an expanded Cd-exposure range . OBJECTIVES We estimated relative Cd exposures from both diet and smoking in low- and high-exposure scenarios to provide data for improving risk assessment calculations . METHODS We used a Cd toxicokinetic-based model to estimate Cd exposures based on urinary Cd levels measured for 399 persons in a low-exposure area ( Bangkok ) and 6,747 persons in a high-exposure area ( Mae Sot ) in Thailand . RESULTS In Bangkok , we estimated dietary Cd exposures of 50-56 Âµg/day for males and 21-27 Âµg/day for females 20-59 years of age who never smoked . In Mae Sot , we estimated dietary Cd exposures of 188-224 Âµg/day for males and 99-113 Âµg/day for females 20-59 years of age who never smoked . In Bangkok , we estimated Cd exposures from smoking to be 5.5-20.4 Âµg/day for male smokers 20-59 years of age . In Mae Sot , we estimated Cd exposures from smoking to be 9.8-26 Âµg/day for male heavy smokers and 26 Âµg/day for female heavy smokers . CONCLUSION This study provides estimates of Cd exposures from diet and smoking in low- and high-exposure scenarios . Our findings suggest a relatively small safety margin between the established tolerable Cd reference exposure of 62 Âµg/day and exposure levels previously associated with evidence of kidney and bone effects in Mae Sot residents , where dietary Cd exposures among women were only 1.6-2.1 times the reference value .	24 12 21 23 1 2 243 127 232
23434818	BACKGROUND Prenatal exposure to environmental levels of organochlorines ( OCs ) has been demonstrated to have immunotoxic effects in humans . We investigated the relationship between prenatal exposure to OCs and the occurrence of otitis media ( OM ) among Inuit children in Greenland . METHODS We estimated the concentration of 14 PCB congeners and 11 pesticides in maternal and cord blood samples and in breast milk in a population-based cohort of 400 mother-child pairs . At follow-up , we examined the children's ears and used their medical records to assess the OM occurrence and severity . Multivariate regression analyses were used with adjustments for passive smoking , crowding , dietary habits , parent's educational level , breast feeding and the use of child-care . RESULTS The children were 4-10 years of age at follow-up and 223 ( 85% ) participated . We found no association between prenatal OC exposure and the development of OM . Factors associated with the child's hazard of OM during the first 4 years of life were : mother's history of OM ( HR 1.70 , 95% CI 1.11-2.59 , p=0.01 ) ; mother's smoking habits : current ( HR 2.47 , 95% CI 1.45-4.21 , p&lt;0.01 ) and previous ( HR 2.00 , 95% CI 1.19-3.36 , p&lt;0.01 ) ; number of smokers in the home ( HR 1.17 , 95% CI 1.05-1.31 , p&lt;0.01 ) . After adjustment mothers ' smoking habits remained significant . CONCLUSION We found no relationship between high levels of prenatal exposure of OCs and occurrence of OM . Passive smoking was found as the strongest environmental risk factor for the development of OM . Interventions to reduce passive smoke in children's environment are needed .	1 122 12 124
23434819	Polybromodiphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , including the decabromodiphenyl congener ( BDE-209 ) , were determined in the serum of 731 individuals from a general adult population ( 18-74 years ) collected in 2002 in Catalonia ( north-eastern Spain ) . The BDE-209 was the predominant congener ( median 3.7 ng/g lipid ) followed by BDE-47 ( 2.6 ng/g lipid ) and BDE-99 ( 1.2 ng/g lipid ) . PBDEs in this population ( median 15.4 ng/g lipid ) ranked amongst the highest of previously described concentrations in populations in Europe , Asia , New Zealand and Australia , yet it was lower than those found in North American reports . Age was clearly the socio-demographic factor of highest influence on the PBDE distributions . However , unlike usual trends of higher accumulation of POPs through age , the higher concentrations were found in young individuals ( &lt;30 years ) rather than in adults ( â¥30 years ) , with differences of 14% , 31% and 46% in the most abundant congeners ( i.e . BDE-209 , BDE-99 and BDE-47 , respectively ) . This age-dependent distribution of PBDEs ( including the case for BDE-209 , which is shown for the first time in this study ) is explained by the higher and widespread use of these compounds since the 1980s . In view that these compounds remain highly used , this accumulation pattern is likely to evolve , anticipating an increasing level of PBDE concentrations in future general population surveys , yet probably assuming an age-dependent increase pattern . Socio-economic level was also a determinant of BDE-47 concentrations , but only relevant for the least affluent class , suggesting that lifestyle and environmental conditions in the dwelling place may also contribute to exposure . Nonetheless , gender , body mass index , place of birth , parity and education level did not show any statistically significant influence on the observed PBDE distributions .	1 122 12
24112656	The objective of this study was to estimate the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs ) in blood serum obtained from non-occupationally exposed volunteers living in the Naples area ( Campania Region , southern Italy ) . The samples were taken from two geographical zones : one was an urban area of Naples and its surroundings and the other was located in an area deemed to be at high environmental risk . Total mean concentrations of these persistent pollutants proved to be in the range 1.43-17.38 pg WHO-TEQ1998 g(-1) lipid for PCDD/Fs , and 0.98-25.45 pg WHO-TEQ1998 g(-1) lipid for DL-PCBs . NDL-PCBs were in the range 316.57-482.90 ng g(-1) lipid . No significant differences were observed between women and men , nor between donors living in the two different areas . The mean levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in the population living in the Naples area were lower than those observed in some studies of populations living in exposed areas ( near incineration plants or industrial sites ) and urban or rural areas .	1 122 12
23437242	BACKGROUND Lab studies have suggested that ubiquitous phthalate exposures are related to obesity , but relevant epidemiological studies are scarce , especially for children . OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of phthalate exposures with body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumference ( WC ) in Chinese school children . METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in three primary and three middle schools randomly selected from Changning District of Shanghai City of China in 2011-2012 . According to the physical examination data in October , 2011 , 124 normal weight , 53 overweight , and 82 obese students 8-15 years of age were randomly chosen from these schools on the basis of BMI-based age- and sex-specific criterion . First morning urine was collected in January , 2012 , and fourteen urine phthalate metabolites ( free plus conjugated ) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry . Multiple linear regression was used to explore the associations between naturally log-transformed urine phthalate metabolites and BMI or WC . RESULTS The urine specific gravity-corrected concentrations of nine urine phthalate metabolites and five molar sums were positively associated with BMI or WC in Chinese school children after adjustment for age and sex . However , when other urine phthalate metabolites were included in the models together with age and sex as covariables , most of these significant associations disappeared except for mono ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( MEHP ) and monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) . Additionally , some associations showed sex- or age-specific differences . CONCLUSIONS Some phthalate exposures were associated with BMI or WC in Chinese school children . Given the cross-sectional nature of this study and lack of some important obesity-related covariables , further studies are needed to confirm the associations .	11 1 127 12 112
9646524	The focus of the present study was on the relationship between Hong Kong male subfertility and fish consumption . Mercury concentrations found in the hair of 159 Hong Kong males aged 25-72 ( mean age = 37 years ) was positively correlated with age and was significantly higher in Hong Kong subjects than in European and Finnish subjects ( 1.2 and 2.1 ppm , respectively ) . Mercury in the hair of 117 subfertile Hong Kong males ( 4.5 ppm , P &lt ; 0.05 ) was significantly higher than mercury levels found in hair collected from 42 fertile Hong Kong males ( 3.9 ppm ) . Subfertile males had approx. 40% more mercury in their hair than fertile males of similar age . Although there were only 35 female subjects , they had significantly lower levels of hair mercury than males in similar age groups . Overall , males had mercury levels that were 60% higher than females . Hair samples collected from 16 vegetarians living in Hong Kong ( vegans that had consumed no fish , shellfish or meat for at least the last 5 years ) had very low levels of mercury . Their mean hair mercury concentration was only 0.38 ppm .	24 12 1 123 243 2
9695168	In 1996 , peripheral blood samples and 24-h food duplicate samples together with samples of wheat , rice , foxtail millet and maize were collected from 50 non-smoking women each from Jinan ( a provincial capital ) and Baiquan ( a nearby basically self-sustaining farming village ) in China . The samples were analyzed for cadmium ( Cd ) contents by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry after wet digestion . The dietary Cd intake of the people in the city was 6.4 micrograms/day as a geometric mean ( GM ) and 5.9 micrograms/day for the villagers . The Cd level in blood was 0.48 and 0.29micrograms/l ( as GMs ) for the city and village people , respectively . Thus , Cd burden of the people in the city tended to be greater than that for those in the village . Nevertheless , the Cd burden of the Jinan citizens was lower than the values published for people in large cities in China . When Cd intake via the four cereals was compared with Cd in total food to estimate the total contribution of the four cereals ( combined ) in total dietary Cd intake , the cereals accounted for 60% of total dietary Cd intake among the city people and as high as 78% among the villagers . Cadmium contents in the four cereals were in a narrow range and it was considered acceptable to combine all cereals in evaluating them as dietary Cd sources .	24 12 1 122 2 243
12003762	We measured two diethyl organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides--chlorpyrifos and parathion--in residences , and their metabolic by-products , in the urine of children 6 years old or younger in a central Washington State agricultural community . Exposures to two dimethyl OP pesticides ( azinphos-methyl and phosmet ) in this same population have been reported previously . We categorized children by parental occupation and by household proximity to pesticide-treated farmland . Median chlorpyrifos house dust concentrations were highest for the 49 applicator homes ( 0.4 microg/g ) , followed by the 12 farm-worker homes ( 0.3 microg/g ) and the 14 nonagricultural reference homes ( 0.1 microg/g ) , and were statistically different ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) ; we observed a similar pattern for parathion in house dust . Chlorpyrifos was measurable in the house dust of all homes , whereas we found parathion in only 41% of the homes . Twenty-four percent of the urine samples from study children had measurable 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPy ) concentrations [ limits of quantitation ( LOQ ) = 8 microg/L ] , and 7% had measurable 4-nitrophenol concentrations ( LOQ = 9 microg/L ) . Child urinary metabolite concentrations did not differ across parental occupational classifications . Homes in close proximity ( 200 ft/60 m ) to pesticide-treated farmland had higher chlorpyrifos ( p = 0.01 ) and parathion ( p = 0.014 ) house dust concentrations than did homes farther away , but this effect was not reflected in the urinary metabolite data . Use of OP pesticides in the garden was associated with an increase in TCPy concentrations in children's urine . Parathion concentrations in house dust decreased 10-fold from 1992 to 1995 , consistent with the discontinued use of this product in the region in the early 1990s .	24 12 242 1 244 2 127
12003757	We determined levels of inorganic mercury ( I-Hg ) and methylmercury in placentas from 119 Swedish women , not selected with respect to high exposure of mercury . Our objective was to relate placental Hg species with maternal and fetal blood concentrations and to evaluate possible associations with selenium . We performed the analyses using automated alkaline solubilization/reduction and cold-vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry . I-Hg levels in placenta increased with an increasing number of maternal dental amalgam fillings ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) . Despite placental accumulation ( median , 1.3 microg/kg ; range , 0.18-6.7 microg/kg wet weight ) , a substantial fraction of maternal blood I-Hg , probably as Hg(0) , reached the fetus . Although MeHg transferred easily to the fetus , it also accumulated in the placenta . On average , 60% of placental Hg was in the form of MeHg . The median concentration was 1.8 microg/kg ( range , 0-6.2 microg/kg wet weight ) , more than twice the maternal blood concentration . We found significant associations between MeHg and selenium in both maternal and umbilical cord blood but not in the placenta . The associations were particularly obvious in freshwater fish consumers , probably reflecting that fish is a source of both MeHg and selenium . We found no correlations between I-Hg and selenium . This study increases the understanding of Hg , in its different forms , in human placenta and how they are related to maternal and fetal exposure .	24 12 243 1 244 122 2 126
24086524	OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of a panel of genes involved in toxicology in response to styrene exposure at levels below the occupational standard setting . METHODS Workers in a fiber glass boat industry were evaluated for a panel of stress- and toxicity-related genes and associated with biochemical parameters related to hepatic injury . Urinary styrene metabolites ( MA+PGA ) of subjects and environmental sampling data collected for air at workplace were used to estimate styrene exposure . RESULTS Expression array analysis revealed massive upregulation of genes encoding stress-responsive proteins ( HSPA1L , EGR1 , IL-6 , IL-1Î² , TNSF10 and TNFÎ± ) in the styrene-exposed group ; the levels of cytokines released were further confirmed in serum . The exposed workers were then stratified by styrene exposure levels . EGR1 gene upregulation paralleled the expression and transcriptional protein levels of IL-6 , TNSF10 and TNFÎ± in styrene exposed workers , even at low level . The activation of the EGR1 pathway observed at low-styrene exposure was associated with a slight increase of hepatic markers found in highly exposed subjects , even though they were within normal range . The ALT and AST levels were not affected by alcohol consumption , and positively correlated with urinary styrene metabolites as evaluated by multiple regression analysis . CONCLUSION The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFÎ± are the primary mediators of processes involved in the hepatic injury response and regeneration . Here , we show that styrene induced stress responsive genes involved in cytoprotection and cytotoxicity at low-exposure , that proceed to a mild subclinical hepatic toxicity at high-styrene exposure .	11 1 12 23 1111 1112 111 11123 127 2 232
9695175	Diesel exhaust consists of a complex mixture of chemicals which contain known genotoxicants , one of which is benzene . Therefore the concentration of benzene may be used in the evaluation of full external exposure to diesel exhaust . Our attention is focused on the determination of the distribution of benzene between the gas and particulate phases in the breathing zone of bus-garage workers . Bus diesel engine exhaust was the main source of air pollution by benzene and particles . The particulate matter contained benzene in amounts comparable to those usually found for concentrations of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) and nitro-PAHs . A much lower concentration of benzene was associated with particulate matter in the winter than in the summer months . The level of benzene in the gas phase showed a dependence on the distance of workplace from the operating diesel motor . The study indicated that benzene associated with diesel exhaust particles ( DEP ) might be an important factor to consider when studying diesel exhaust exposure from air pollution sources . Since non-genotoxic effects may play an important role in the generation of tumors by genotoxic carcinogens , the level of heme synthesis was proposed as a biomarker of early health effect . Here we present the data on determination of 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) synthesis and heme formation in lymphocytes from a group of 45 bus-garage workers and an analogous data from a group of 25 unexposed subjects . The results indicate significant differences in ALA synthesis and heme formation between the exposed workers when compared to the non-exposed individuals . ALA was accumulated and ALA-synthase activity was increased in lymphocytes of garage workers . At the same time ferrochelatase activity was decreased and protoporphyrin contents were elevated . In addition the concentration of porphyrin associated with DNA was significantly increased . Thus , the measurement of some metabolites of heme synthesis in lymphocytes could be a useful biomonitoring index for the determination of a sensitive subgroup of workers who undergo the higher risk of cancer development .	11 23 1 11122 11123 111 2 1112 233
12002472	Four samples of Chinese tea ( two green teas , and two brick teas ) were analyzed for their concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDD/PCDF ) , chlorinated pesticides and PAH . The infusions prepared from these teas were also analyzed for PCDD/PCDF . The levels of DDT and its metabolites in tea leaves were within the safety limit of 0.2 mg/kg . Rather high levels of total PAH were obtained in brick tea ( 1,048-1,162 mg/kg). when compared with green tea ( 497-517 mg/kg ) . In terms of PCDD/PCDF , the concentrations of green tea and brick tea differed by a factor of 16 , while the concentrations of all infusions were within a factor of 2 . The dioxin concentrations in green tea leaves can be explained through uptake of atmospheric PCDD/PCDF . The higher concentrations in the brick tea leaves are due the longer exposure time , and to certain extent , the use of old leaves , branches and roots when making the tea , and additional components such as soil particulates through contamination . Certain Chinese populations drinking a large amount of brick tea ( &gt;31 per day ) indicated that individuals of these populations consume more tea than Europeans or North Americans result in a comparably higher intake of PCDD/PCDF . Tea consumption can attribute to up to 10% of the TDI recommended by WHO ( only PCDD/PCDF considered , no PCB analyzed ) .	24 2 243
23454108	We analyzed the polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in human hair collected from an electronic waste ( e-waste ) recycling area in southern China and compared their composition profiles and chiral signatures to those of workplace and domestic dust . The PCB concentrations showed significant age dependence in dismantling workers ' hair but not in residents ' hair . Among residents , PCB concentrations decreased in the following order : elderly people&gt;students&gt;pre-school children&gt;adults . The PCB homologue and congener profiles of the workers ' hair were similar to those of the workplace dust . However , the PCB homologue profile of the residents ' hair was clearly different from that of the domestic dust . The chiral congener CB95 generally exhibited a racemic or near-racemic composition in both hair and dust , with enantiomer fractions ( EFs ) ranging from 0.485 to 0.525 in hair and from 0.479 to 0.504 in dust . The EFs of CB132 in dust ( 0.477-0.513 ) were closer to a racemic chiral signature than those in hair ( 0.378-0.521 ) , but this difference was not significant . Our results suggest that the chiral signature of PCBs may be a better tool than the PCB composition profile for identifying the external and internal sources of organic contaminants in human hair . Further measurements of chiral PCB signatures in hair and blood from the same individuals are needed to identify the external and internal sources of PCBs in human hair .	24 12 1 123 242 2
24084758	Owing to data collection challenges , the vertical variation in population in cities and particulate air pollution are typically not accounted for in exposure assessments , which may lead to misclassification of exposures based on elevation of residency . To better assess this misclassification , the vertical distribution of the potentially highly exposed population ( PHEP ) , defined as all residents within the 100-m buffer zone of above-ground highways or the 200-m buffer zone of a highway-tunnel exit , was estimated for four floor categories in Boston's Chinatown ( MA , USA ) using the three-dimensional digital geography methodology . Vertical profiles of particle number concentration ( 7-3000ânm ; PNC ) and particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) mass concentration were measured by hoisting instruments up the vertical face of an 11-story ( 35-m ) building near the study area throughout the day on multiple days . The concentrations from all the profiles ( n=23 ) were averaged together for each floor category . As measurement elevation increased from 0 to 35âm PNC decreased by 7.7% , compared with 3.6% for PM2.5 . PHEP was multiplied by the average PNC for each floor category to assess exposures for near-highway populations . The results show that adding temporally-averaged vertical air pollution data had a small effect on residential ambient exposures for our study population ; however , greater effects were observed when individual days were considered ( e.g. , winds were off the highways).Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication , 2 October 2013 ; doi:10.1038/jes.2013.64 .	2 232 23
23457607	Trace elements might play a role in the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . The aim of this study was to measure alterations of trace elements levels in aqueous humor of patients with non-exsudative ( dry ) AMD . For this pilot study , aqueous humor samples were collected from patients undergoing cataract surgery. 12 patients with dry AMD ( age 77.9Â±6.62 , female 8 , male 4 ) and 11 patients without AMD ( age 66.6Â±16.7 , female 7 , male 4 ) were included . Aqueous levels of cadmium , cobalt , copper , iron , manganese , selenium , and zinc were measured by use of Flow-Injection-Inductively-Coupled-Plasma-Mass-Spectrometry ( FI-ICP-MS ) , quality controlled with certified standards . Patients with AMD had significantly higher aqueous humor levels of cadmium ( median : 0.70 Âµmol/L , IQR : 0.40-0.84 vs. 0.06 Âµmol/L ; IQR : 0.01-.018 ; pâ=â0.002 ) , cobalt ( median : 3.1 Âµmol/L , IQR : 2.62-3.15 vs. 1.17 Âµmol/L ; IQR : 0.95-1.27 ; p&lt;0.001 ) , iron ( median : 311 Âµmol/L , IQR : 289-329 vs. 129 Âµmol/L ; IQR : 111-145 ; p&lt;0.001 ) and zinc ( median : 23.1 Âµmol/L , IQR : 12.9-32.6 vs. 5.1 Âµmol/L ; IQR : 4.4-9.4 ; pâ=â0.020 ) when compared with patients without AMD . Copper levels were significantly reduced in patients with AMD ( median : 16.2 Âµmol/L , IQR : 11.4-31.3 vs. 49.9 Âµmol/L ; IQR : 32.0-.142.0 ; pâ=â0.022 ) when compared to those without . No significant differences were observed in aqueous humor levels of manganese and selenium between patients with and without AMD . After an adjustment for multiple testing , cadmium , cobalt , copper and iron remained a significant factor in GLM models ( adjusted for age and gender of the patients ) for AMD . Alterations of trace element levels support the hypothesis that cadmium , cobalt , iron , and copper are involved in the pathogenesis of AMD .	1 12 125
11999793	To explore the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in California , samples from 11 archived harbor seals ( Phoca vitulina Richardsi ) from the San Francisco Bay and breast adipose tissue samples from 23 women were analyzed . The levels of PBDEs in human tissue samples were in the low ng/g fat range , with PBDEs 47 , 153 , 154 , 99 , and 100 as the major congeners . Average sigma PBDEs ( 86 ng/g fat ) in these California women are the highest human levels reported to date . An inverse relationship between concentration of PBDEs and age of these women was apparent . The levels of PBDEs measured in harbor seal blubber were in the low ng/g to low microg/g fat range , with the same major congeners as those measured in the human tissues . PBDE 47 was the highest among all congeners measured in both human tissue and seal blubber samples . The concentrations of PBDEs in harbor seals in the San Francisco Bay have increased dramatically over the past decade , with current levels among the highest reported for this species .	1 121 12
9758107	BACKGROUND Studies in Taiwan have found dose-response relations between arsenic ingestion from drinking water and cancers of the skin , bladder , lung , kidney and liver . To investigate these associations in another population , we conducted a study in CÃ³rdoba , Argentina , which has a well-documented history of arsenic exposure from drinking water . METHODS Mortality from lung , kidney , liver and skin cancers during the period 1986-1991 in CÃ³rdoba's 26 counties was investigated , expanding the authors ' previous analysis of bladder cancer in the province . Counties were grouped a priori into low , medium and high arsenic exposure categories based on available data . Standardized mortality ratios ( SMR ) were calculated using all of Argentina as the reference population . RESULTS We found increasing trends for kidney and lung cancer mortality with arsenic exposure , with the following SMR , for men and women respectively : kidney cancer , 0.87 , 1.33 , 1.57 and 1.00 , 1.36 , 1.81 ; lung cancer , 0.92 , 1.54 , 1.77 and 1.24 , 1.34 , 2.16 ( in all cases , P &lt ; 0.001 in trend test ) , similar to the previously reported bladder cancer results ( 0.80 , 1.28 , 2.14 for men , 1.22 , 1.39 , 1.81 for women ) . There was a small positive trend for liver cancer but mortality was increased in all three exposure groups . Skin cancer mortality was elevated for women only in the high exposure group , while men showed a puzzling increase in mortality in the low exposure group . CONCLUSIONS The results add to the evidence that arsenic ingestion increases the risk of lung and kidney cancers . In this study , the association between arsenic and mortality from liver and skin cancers was not clear .	24 2 241
23461877	BACKGROUND A reduction in the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) because of human health concerns may result in an increased use of and human exposure to organophosphate flame retardants ( OPFRs ) . Human exposure and health studies of OPFRs are lacking . OBJECTIVES We sought to define the degree of temporal variability in urinary OPFR metabolites in order to inform epidemiologic study design , and to explore a potential primary source of exposure by examining the relationship between OPFRs in house dust and their metabolites in urine . METHODS Nine repeated urine samples were collected from 7 men over the course of 3 months and analyzed for bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate ( BDCPP ) and diphenyl phosphate ( DPP ) , metabolites of the OPFRs tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate ( TDCPP ) and triphenyl phosphate ( TPP ) , respectively . Intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) were calculated to characterize temporal reliability . Paired house dust and urine samples were collected from 45 men . RESULTS BDCPP was detected in 91% of urine samples , and DPP in 96% . Urinary BDCPP showed moderate-to-strong temporal reliability ( ICC range , 0.55-0.72 ) . ICCs for DPP were lower , but moderately reliable ( range , 0.35-0.51 ) . There was a weak [ Spearman r ( r(S) ) = 0.31 ] but significant ( p = 0.03 ) correlation between urinary BDCPP and TDCPP concentrations in house dust that strengthened when nondetects ( r(S) = 0.47 ) were excluded . There was no correlation between uncorrected DPP and TPP measured in house dust ( r(S) &lt ; 0.1 ) . CONCLUSIONS Household dust may be an important source of exposure to TDCPP but not TPP . Urinary concentrations of BDCPP and DPP were moderately to highly reliable within individuals over 3 months .	24 12 127 1 2 242
9817078	We have studied hepatic function in individuals chronically exposed to arsenic ( As ) via drinking water in Region Lagunera , Mexico . We studied 51 individuals living in three villages exposed to As in water . Nazareno ( 0.014 mgAs/l ) , Santa Ana ( 0.1 mgAs/l ) and Benito JuÃ¡rez ( 0.3 mgAs/l ) . We determined the serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase ( SAT ) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) as indicators of hepatocellular injury and that of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase ( GGT ) and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) as indicators of cholestasic injury . Serum bilirubin was used as an indicator of organic conjugated anion transport . Total proteins , albumin and globulin fraction in serum were used as indicators of biosynthetic liver capacity . The main findings of this study were the predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and increased serum ALP activity which were related to the concentration of total arsenic ( TAs ) in urine , suggesting the presence of cholestasis in As-exposed individuals . No significant changes were observed in the other parameters studied .	11 24 12 1 11122 2 241 11123 127 111 1112
24072527	Concentrations of mercury and arsenic in fish from the Persian Gulf were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry . Concentrations of the metals in muscle samples were 0.049-0.402Î¼gg(-1) for mercury and 0.168-0.479Î¼gg(-1) for arsenic , with means of 0.133 and 0.312Î¼gg(-1) , respectively . The maximum daily consumption rate ( grams per day ) and meal consumption limit ( meals per month ) was calculated to estimate health risks associated with fish consumption . According to the results , the maximum allowable consumption rate varies between 8-56 and 15-96g/day base on mercury and arsenic content , respectively . The results of this study indicate that the concentration of mercury and arsenic is well below the maximum permissible levels for mercury ( 0.5Î¼gg(-1) ) and arsenic ( 6Î¼gg(-1) ) according to international standards .	24 2 243
9871886	Porphyrin , mercury , and creatinine levels in single-void urine specimens ( "spot samples" ) were compared with calculated 24-hour urine concentrations among 146 ( 77 male and 69 female ) practicing dentists who are participating in an ongoing study of urinary porphyrin changes as a biomarker of mercury body burden . All subjects had urinary mercury concentrations &lt ; or = 5 micrograms/L , a level comparable to that of the general US population and which is below that determined to be associated with mercury-induced changes in urinary porphyrin excretion rates . The results confirmed previous findings of no significant diurnal variation in any of the porphyrin levels normally found in urine or in total porphyrin levels combined among males but describe significant diurnal variations in most porphyrin levels as well as concentrations of total porphyrins combined among females . Similarly , no evidence of large diurnal variation in mercury excretion among males was apparent , whereas significant diurnal variation in the mercury excretion rate among females was found . Creatinine adjustment of porphyrin or mercury concentrations had no significant effect on these findings . Moreover , no evidence of diurnal variation in urinary creatinine excretion among either male or female subjects was obtained , despite substantial between-subject variability in this parameter . These results support the view that spot urine samples may be utilized to derive reasonably accurate estimates of 24-hour porphyrin and mercury excretion rates in male subjects . In contrast , time of day appears to be of considerably greater importance when spot samples are utilized as 24-hour estimates of either porphyrin or mercury excretion rates among females . Additionally , time of day may be an important consideration in studies involving serial ( repeated ) porphyrin or mercury measurements using spot urine samples , irrespective of gender distribution of study subjects .	11 12 1 11122 1112 111 127
11829397	Hair analysis was used for the assessment of exposure to organochlorine pollutants in specimens from Greece , Romania and Belgium . A simple method ( using 3 N HCI as incubation reagent , liquid-liquid extraction with hexane/ dichloromethane ( DCM ) , alumina/acid silica clean-up and GC-ECD/GC-MS analysis ) was used for screening of specimens . The highest organochlorine load ( up to 148 ng/g hair for the sum of PCB , DDT and hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) isomers ) was found in samples from a group of Greek women with past occupational exposure to pesticides . DDTs were the main organochlorine pollutants in Greek samples ( up to 70% ) , while in Belgian hair samples their contribution was reduced to 40% . PCB mean concentration was higher in Belgian specimens ( up to 14 ng/g hair ) . Lindane ( y-HCH ) was the main HCH isomer found in the samples ( up to 82% in the Greek samples ) . Contribution of p,p'-DDT to the sum of DDTs was higher in Greek samples and indicates recent exposure to technical DDT . Similar PCB 153/sum PCBs ratios were found for each of the three countries suggesting similar sources of pollution with PCBs ( mainly dietary ) . Artificially coloured hair samples were found to have lower , but not statistically significant concentrations of organochlorine pollutants than the non-coloured hair .	1 123 12
11101537	BACKGROUND Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) have been a major environmental health concern because of their wide distribution and persistence in the environment . Estimating joint effects of all congeners in a single analysis is complicated by correlation among exposure levels , and the resulting collinearity makes the results difficult to interpret . METHODS Patients with breast-related surgery at Yale-New Haven Hospital were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire , and breast adipose tissue samples were analysed for nine PCB congeners ( 74 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 156 , 170 , 180 , 183 , 187 ) . The study recruited 490 women ( 304 cases and 186 controls ) between 1994 and 1997 . Logistic ridge regression was used to analyse the instability caused by collinearity . RESULTS Although total PCB did not appear to be associated with breast cancer risk , significant differences in effect were observed among the nine congeners . Logistic ridge regression demonstrated a protective effect on breast cancer risk for a potentially anti-oestrogenic and dioxin-like congener , 156 , while two phenobarbital , CYP1A and CYP2B inducers had an adverse effect , 180 and 183 . This analysis also suggested that a protective effect for another phenobarbital congener , 153 , was largely explained by instability caused by collinearity . CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that studies of PCB congeners and health require an in-depth statistical analysis in order to better understand the complex issues related to their collinearity .	1 121 12
8896724	To assess whether regular consumption of seafood , particularly fish and shellfish , by humans may lead to an overexposure to inorganic arsenic , a well-established human carcinogen , the urinary excretion of the relevant As metabolites ( Asi , inorganic form ; MMA , monomethylarsonic acid ; DMA , dimethylarsinic acid ) was compared in groups of subjects with different seafood consumption habits and in volunteers after ingestion of a known amount of seafood arsenicals . Studies of Italian cohorts , involving five groups of +/-30 subjects with different seafood consumption habits , and balance studies in Belgian volunteers failed to show a biologically significant absorption of inorganic arsenic either present as such in the food or formed from organoarsenicals during cooking or digestion . The results suggest that the digestion of some seafood , especially mussels , may increase the urinary excretion of the dimethylated arsenic metabolite . Therefore , the biological monitoring of exposure to inorganic arsenic in an industrial context should mainly rely upon specific measurement of the unmetabolized form when recent ingestion of seafood cannot be excluded .	24 12 1 2 243 127
8584917	The level of lead and cadmium in foodstuffs in the Republic of Croatia was determined by the method of atomic absorption spectrophotometry from the beginning of 1988 to mid 1993 . Mean weekly dietary intake of these toxic metals was then estimated on the basis of the level of contamination and consumption of the foodstuffs concerned . The results show that mean weekly dietary intake of lead is 701 micrograms/person and 121.4 micrograms cadmium/person . With respect to the provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI ) , these values are equal to 19.9% for lead and 24.4% for cadmium .	24 2 243
11068924	Fish is an important food resource in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems . There is a strong cultural background regarding fish consumption ( fish lore ) among indigenous people in the Amazon . Mercury ( Hg ) ingestion through fish consumption has been a major route of Hg exposure among the riverside people along the Upper Madeira River . In this paper a diet questionnaire was used to identify patterns of fish consumption . The amount of fish consumed during the dry season and Hg levels in fish were combined to estimate Hg ingestion . Using as guidance hair Hg levels below 5 and 10 ppm as acceptable to protect the fetus and adult , respectively , along with an average daily fish consumption of 243 g per capita , we estimated the maximum acceptable number of fish meals per week for different fish species . Based on this analysis , it is suggested that there is a need to address risk communication for this exposed population in the context of health in terms of a fish advisory . For the fish advisory it is necessary to recommend to fish consumers , fishermen , and fish sellers an acceptable number of fish meals to be consumed according to species .	24 2 243
11068923	Cross-sectional studies were conducted in three riverside communities in the state of ParÃ¡ in the Amazon Region of Brazil . Two of these communities , BrasÃ­lia Legal and SÃ£o LuÃ­s do TapajÃ³s , are located in a watershed exposed to mercury pollution from artisanal gold mining , and the third , Santana do Ituqui , is outside this area . The studies were based upon a community census and included all persons volunteering for participation in each community . All participants were surveyed by questionnaire for health history , occupation , residence , and diet . Clinical evaluations were also done on each subject , along with collection of blood , urine , feces , and hair . Fish samples were collected to represent the most frequently consumed species . Mercury was measured in hair and fish . Although no signs or symptoms of overt mercury intoxication were observed , persons in BrasÃ­lia Legal and SÃ£o LuÃ­s do TapajÃ³s had higher levels of mercury in hair than residents of Santana de Ituqui , located out of the risk area . Levels of mercury in fish were below Brazilian health guidance limits , but the high rates of fish consumption among these populations raise concerns for the possible effects of chronic exposure , especially among young children and women of childbearing age .	24 12 1 123 243 2
24051894	BACKGROUND Epidemiologic studies have reported associations between air pollution levels and semen characteristics , which might in turn affect a couple's ability to achieve a live birth . Our aim was to characterize short-term effects of atmospheric pollutants on fecundability ( the month-specific probability of pregnancy among noncontracepting couples ) . METHODS For a cohort of births between 1994 and 1999 in Teplice ( Czech Republic ) , we averaged fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) , carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , ozone , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , and sulfur dioxide levels estimated from a central measurement site over the 60-day period before the end of the first month of unprotected intercourse . We estimated changes in the probability of occurrence of a pregnancy during the first month of unprotected intercourse associated with exposure , using binomial regression and adjusting for maternal behaviors and time trends . RESULTS Among the 1,916 recruited couples , 486 ( 25% ) conceived during the first month of unprotected intercourse . Each increase of 10 Âµg/m in PM2.5 levels was associated with an adjusted decrease in fecundability of 22% ( 95% confidence interval = 6%-35% ) . NO2 levels were also associated with decreased fecundability . There was no evidence of adverse effects with the other pollutants considered . Biases related to pregnancy planning or temporal trends in air pollution were unlikely to explain the observed associations . CONCLUSIONS In this polluted area , we highlighted short-term decreases in a couple's ability to conceive in association with PM2.5 and NO2 levels assessed in a central monitoring station .	11 23 1 2 112 231
24049161	Chronic exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , but the association between lower levels of arsenic and T2DM is more controversial . Therefore , this study evaluated the association between low to moderate arsenic exposure and T2DM . In 2009-2011 , we conducted a study of 957 Bangladeshi adults who participated in a case-control study of skin lesions in 2001-2003 . The odds ratio of T2DM was evaluated in relationship to arsenic exposure measured in drinking water and in subjects ' toenails ( in 2001-2003 ) prior to the diagnosis of T2DM ( in 2009-2011 ) . Compared with those exposed to the lowest quartile of arsenic in water ( â¤ 1.7 Âµg/L ) , the adjusted odds ratio for T2DM was 1.92 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.82 , 4.35 ) for those in the second quartile , 3.07 ( 95% CI : 1.38 , 6.85 ) for those in the third quartile , and 4.51 ( 95% CI : 2.01 , 10.09 ) for those in the fourth quartile . The relative excess risk of T2DM was 4.78 for individuals who smoked and 8.93 for people who had a body mass index ( weight ( kg)/height ( m)(2) ) greater than 25 . These findings suggest that exposure to modest levels of arsenic in drinking water was associated with increased risk of T2DM in Bangladesh . Being overweight or smoking was also associated with increased risk of T2DM .	24 12 1 123 241 2
8821363	An acute oral protein load causes a transient hyperfiltration that might reveal a loss of glomerular permselectivity properties . The effect of an oral protein load on the urinary excretion rate of albumin ( UAE ) , beta-2-microglobulin ( UB2MGE ) , and retinol-binding protein ( URBPE ) was thus examined in cadmium- and lead-exposed workers . The results show a transient increase in UB2MGE and URBPE without relevant changes in UAE . These changes were also observed in control groups and are due to competitive inhibition of tubular protein reabsorption by absorbed cationic amino acids . These results do not support the hypothesis that the acute protein load test is of great utility in revealing a silent glomerular filtration disturbance in lead- or cadmium-exposed workers . However , it might disclose imminent renal tubular dysfunction in cadmium workers not yet showing increased microproteinuria under baseline conditions .	11 1 11123 111 1112
11055628	Cities in northern Chile had arsenic concentrations of 860 microg/liter in drinking water in the period 1958-1970 . Concentrations have since been reduced to 40 microg/liter . We investigated the relation between lung cancer and arsenic in drinking water in northern Chile in a case-control study involving patients diagnosed with lung cancer between 1994 and 1996 and frequency-matched hospital controls . The study identified 152 lung cancer cases and 419 controls . Participants were interviewed regarding drinking water sources , cigarette smoking , and other variables . Logistic regression analysis revealed a clear trend in lung cancer odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) with increasing concentration of arsenic in drinking water , as follows : 1 , 1.6 ( 95% CI = 0.5-5.3 ) , 3.9 ( 95% CI = 1.2-12.3 ) , 5.2 ( 95% CI = 2.3-11.7 ) , and 8.9 ( 95% CI = 4.0-19.6 ) , for arsenic concentrations ranging from less than 10 microg/liter to a 65-year average concentration of 200-400 microg/liter . There was evidence of synergy between cigarette smoking and ingestion of arsenic in drinking water ; the odds ratio for lung cancer was 32.0 ( 95% CI = 7.2-198.0 ) among smokers exposed to more than 200 microg/liter of arsenic in drinking water ( lifetime average ) compared with nonsmokers exposed to less than 50 microg/liter . This study provides strong evidence that ingestion of inorganic arsenic is associated with human lung cancer .	24 2 241
11032135	The mercury content in hair , for exposed dental workers and unexposed groups of people living in Albania was studied . The influence of factors such as age , sex , body weight , fish consumption in the diet , number of dental amalgam fillings and time exposed to mercury , was determined . The mean value of mercury content in hair for the subjects under study ( 0.705 microg/g ) was found to be lower than the value referred from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for people who do not consume fish with a high methylmercury content ( 1-2 microg/g ) . A significant positive correlation of Hg content with the number of dental amalgam fillings , time under exposure and frequency of fish consumption in the diet was found . These correlations became stronger when exposed and unexposed groups of people were evaluated separately .	24 12 1 244 123 243 2
11032134	In northern Tanzania large numbers of small scale miners use mercury in the gold extraction process causing contamination of the environment and risks to human health . Human exposure to Hg was assessed in populations in and around small scale gold mining camps by means of human hair and urine surveys . We also determined Hg concentration in fish in aquatic bodies close to these camps . Urinary Hg testing in three communities showed that 36% of the gold miners working with amalgam exceeded the WHO guideline concentration of 50 microg Hg/g creatinine . Data from a hair survey of fishermen and farmers confirm that at present , the fish-eating population close to the southern tip of Lake Victoria is at low risk with regard to Hg exposure . Concentrations in fish were low and &gt ; 90% of the hair samples from the fish-eating population were below 2 microg/g T-Hg . Highest Hg concentrations in fish caught along the southern shores of Lake Victoria and in rivers draining from gold processing sites were detected in lungfish species ( Protopterus aethiopicus ) , and lowest Hg concentrations in tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus and Tilapia zilii ) .	24 12 1 123 243 127 2
23517909	The distribution of acrylamide in food items frequently consumed by Canadian adolescents was determined along with estimates of their contribution to the overall dietary intake of acrylamide . A total of 196 non-smoking adolescents ( 10-17 years old ) were recruited in Montreal Island population , Canada . Participants were invited to fill out a 2-day food diary and a food frequency questionnaire over the last month. 146 samples of foods most frequently consumed by participants were analyzed for acrylamide contents . The highest acrylamide contents were measured in deep-fried french fries and potato chips ( mean Â± SD : 1053 Â± 657 and 524 Â± 276 ng/g respectively ) . On the basis of the 2-day food diary , median total daily intake of acrylamide was estimated at 0.29 Î¼g/kg bw/d , as compared to 0.17 Î¼g/kg bw/d on the basis of the food frequency questionnaire . These values are similar to those reported in comparable populations . Deep-fried french fries consumption contributed the most to daily acrylamide intake ( 50% ) followed by potato chips ( 10% ) , oven-baked french fries ( 8% ) and breakfast cereals ( 8% ) . Margins of exposure based on genotoxic benchmark dose limits were estimated to be low ( â&lt;100 ) in high-consumer adolescents , indicating the need to continue efforts to reduce dietary acrylamide exposure .	24 2 243
24041567	Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A ( BPA ) and phthalates is prevalent among children and adolescents , but little is known regarding important sources of exposure at these sensitive life stages . In this study , we measured urinary concentrations of BPA and nine phthalate metabolites in 108 Mexican children aged 8-13 years . Associations of age , time of day , and questionnaire items on external environment , water use , and food container use with specific gravity-corrected urinary concentrations were assessed , as were questionnaire items concerning the use of 17 personal care products in the past 48-h . As a secondary aim , third trimester urinary concentrations were measured in 99 mothers of these children , and the relationship between specific gravity-corrected urinary concentrations at these two time points was explored . After adjusting for potential confounding by other personal care product use in the past 48-h , there were statistically significant ( p&lt;0.05 ) positive associations in boys for cologne/perfume use and monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate ( MCPP ) , mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate ( MEHHP ) , and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate ( MEOHP ) , and in girls for colored cosmetics use and mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MBP ) , mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) , MEHHP , MEOHP , and mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate ( MECPP ) , conditioner use and MEP , deodorant use and MEP , and other hair products use and MBP . There was a statistically significant positive trend for the number of personal care products used in the past 48-h and log-MEP in girls . However , there were no statistically significant associations between the analytes and the other questionnaire items and there were no strong correlations between the analytes measured during the third trimester and at 8-13 years of age . We demonstrated that personal care product use is associated with exposure to multiple phthalates in children . Due to rapid development , children may be susceptible to impacts from exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals ; thus , reduced or delayed use of certain personal care products among children may be warranted .	24 12 22 1 244 2 241 243 127
8833776	Benzene is a well-established hematotoxin . However , reports of its effects on specific blood cells have been somewhat inconsistent and the relative toxicity of benzene metabolites on peripheral blood cells in humans has not been evaluated . We compared hematologic outcomes in a cross-sectional study of 44 workers heavily exposed to benzene ( median : 31 parts permillion [ ppm ] as an 8-hr time-weighted average [ TWA ] and 44 age and gender-matched unexposed controls from Shanghai , China . All hematologic parameters ( total white blood cells [ WBC ] , absolute lymphocyte count , platelets , red blood cells , and hematocrit ) were decreased among exposed workers compared to controls , with the exception of the red blood cell mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) , which was higher among exposed subjects . In a subgroup of workers who were not exposed to more than 31 ppm benzene on any of 5 sampling days ( n = 11 , median 8 hr TWA = 7.6 ppm , range = 1-20 ppm ) , only the absolute lymphocyte count was significantly different between exposed workers ( mean [ sd]1.6 [ 0.4 ] x 10(3) mu L ) and controls ( 1.9 [ 0.4 ] x l0(3) uL , p = 0.03 ) . Among exposed subjects , a dose response relationship with various measures of current benzene exposure ( i.e. , personal air monitoring , benzene metabolites in urine ) was present only for the total WBC count , the absolute lymphocyte count , and the MCV . Correlations between benzene metabolites and hematologic parameters were generally similar , although hydroquinone was somewhat more strongly associated with a decrease in the absolute lymphocyte count , and catechol was more strongly associated with an increase in MCV . Morphologic review of peripheral blood slides demonstrated an excess of red blood cell abnormalities ( i.e. , stomatocytes and target cells ) only in the most heavily exposed workers , with no differences in granulocyte , lymphocyte , or platelet morphology noted . Although benzene can affect all the major peripheral blood elements , our results support the use of the absolute lymphocyte count as the most sensitive indicator of benzene-induced hematotoxicity .	11 12 23 1 1113 2 111 127 233
8833777	This study evaluated the relationship between benzene exposure and low white blood cell ( WBC ) and red blood cell ( RBC ) counts . Hematologic screening data collected over a 35 year period at a rubber hydrochloride manufacturing plant were analyzed ; an increased risk of leukemia had been demonstrated previously among workers at the plant [ Infante et al . ( 1977). ' Lancet 2:76-78 ; Rinsky et al . ( 1981 ) : Am J Ind Med 2:217-45 ( 1987 ) : NEJM 316:1044-1050/ . Hematologic screening data were available for 657 of 1,037 ( 63.3% ) individuals employed at the plant from 1939 through 1976 . There was a total of 21. 710 blood test records ( range per individual 1-354 ) . The study utilized a case-control design and estimated benzene exposures using the job exposure matrix developed by Rinsky et al . ( 1987 ) : NEJM 316:1044-1050 ] . The effects of benzene exposure in the 30 , 90 , and 180 days before the blood test date , as well as cumulative exposure up until the blood test date , were examined using conditional logistic regression . For WBCs there was a strong exposure response and all of the exposure metrics selected showed a significant relationship with low blood count . For RBCs there was a weak positive exposure-response , which was significant ( p = 0.03 ) for one of the dose metrics . The finding of an exposure-response relationship in the range of exposures represented in this study , where the maximum daily benzene exposure estimate was 34 ppm , is consistent with findings of several animal studies demonstrating a decrease in peripheral lymphocyte counts at benzene exposures as low as 10 ppm , and a stronger effect of benzene exposure on lymphocytes ( as reflected in total WBC count ) than on red cells . There was no evidence for a threshold for the hematologic effects of benzene exposure , suggesting that even exposure to relatively low levels of benzene ( e.g. , &lt;5 ppm ) may result in hematologic suppression .	11 21 1 1113 2 111
8781377	We hypothesize that chronic exposure to environmental toxicants can induce genetic damage causing DNA repair deficiencies and leading to the postulated mutator phenotype of carcinogenesis . To test our hypothesis , a host cell reactivation ( HCR ) assay was used in which pCMVcat plasmids were damaged with UV light ( 175 , 350 J/m2 UV light ) , inactivating the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene , and then transfected into lymphocytes . Transfected lymphocytes were therefore challenged to repair the damaged plasmids , reactivating the reporter gene . Xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) and Gaucher cell lines were used as positive and negative controls for the HCR assay . The Gaucher cell line repaired normally but XP cell lines demonstrated lower repair activity . Additionally , the repair activity of the XP heterozygous cell line showed intermediate repair compared to the homozygous XP and Gaucher cells . We used HCR to measure the effects of benzene exposure on 12 exposed and 8 nonexposed workers from a local benzene plant . Plasmids 175 J/m2 and 350 J/m2 were repaired with a mean frequency of 66% and 58% , respectively , in control workers compared to 71% and 62% in exposed workers . Conversely , more of the exposed workers were grouped into the reduced repair category than controls . These differences in repair capacity between exposed and control workers were , however , not statistically significant . The lack of significant differences between the exposed and control groups may be due to extremely low exposure to benzene ( &lt ; 0.3 ppm ) , small population size , or a lack of benzene genotoxicity at these concentrations . These results are consistent with a parallel hprt gene mutation assay .	1 1111 111 11
23542681	There are cadmium-polluted areas in Japan , where farmers may be at risk of renal dysfunction due to cadmium exposure through consumption of home-harvested rice . The aims of this study were to investigate levels of cadmium exposure and accumulation and their renal effects in female farmers residing in cadmium-polluted areas , and to consider the relevance of age to the effects of cadmium . We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1200 women ( 40-79years old ) without symptomatic disorders in two cadmium-polluted areas and one unpolluted area as a control . Rice , blood , and urine samples were collected to measure the cadmium levels , together with urinary levels of Î±1-microglobulin and Î²2-microglobulin for renal tubular function . Cadmium levels in rice were significantly higher in the polluted areas than control area . Blood and urinary cadmium levels , along with urinary protein levels , were also significantly higher in the polluted areas , especially among the elder subjects . There was one case of cadmium nephropathy in the polluted areas . Age- and urinary cadmium-specific analysis for all the subjects showed a mild linear dose-response relationship between urinary cadmium and proteins in the younger women , and a steep progress of renal dysfunction over the threshold of urinary cadmium ( 10Î¼g/g creatinine ) in the older women . In conclusion , the aged women in the polluted areas showed high accumulation of cadmium and deterioration of renal function through consumption of rice . Also , the aging process itself appeared to contribute to the different renal effects of cadmium observed in the elderly population .	24 11 12 1 122 11123 111 243 127 2 1112
8781402	Assessment of human health risks of environmental agents has often been limited to consideration of the potential for the agent to cause cancer or general systemic toxicity after long-term exposure . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S . EPA ) is increasingly moving toward the development of integrated assessments , which consider all potential health end points including developmental toxicity , neurotoxicity , immunotoxicity , reproductive effects , and germ cell mutagenicity . The U.S. EPA has a responsibility to assess risks to nonhuman species or ecosystems when appropriate data are available . An example of a recent integrated human health and ecological risk assessment can be found in the U.S. EPA Mercury Study Report to Congress . This report covers the following topics in separate volumes : an inventory of anthropogenic mercury emissions in the United States ; an exposure assessment using measured and predicted values and including indirect dietary exposure ; an evaluation of human health risks ; an assessment of ecologic risk wherein water criteria are presented for several wildlife species ; an overall integrated characterization of human and nonhuman risk ; and a discussion of risk management considerations . In the evaluation of human health risk , genetic toxicology data were considered for three forms of mercury : elemental , inorganic ( divalent ) , and methylmercury . These data were used in judgments of two types of potential health effects ( carcinogenicity and germ cell mutagenicity ) . In assessment of potential carcinogenicity of inorganic and methylmercury , genetic toxicity data were key . Data for clastogenicity in the absence of mutagenicity supported the characterization of inorganic and methylmercury as materials that produce carcinogenic effects only at high , toxic doses . The evidence for clastogenicity , coupled with information on metabolism and distribution , resulted in a judgment of a moderate degree of concern ( or weight of evidence ) that inorganic mercury can act as a human germ cell mutagen . For methylmercury , the degree of concern for germ cell mutagenicity is high .	24 2
10901333	A study was conducted to evaluate toenail arsenic concentrations as a biologic marker of drinking water arsenic exposure . Study subjects were controls in a US population-based case-control study of nonmelanoma skin cancer , randomly selected from drivers ' license records ( those &lt ; 65 years of age ) and Medicare enrollment files ( those &gt ; or = 65 years of age ) . Between 1994 and 1997 , a total of 540 controls were interviewed and toenail samples of sufficient weight were collected from 506 ( 93.7% ) of these . Beginning in 1995 , a sample of tap water was taken from the participants ' homes ; a total of 217 ( 98.6% ) water samples were obtained from the 220 subjects interviewed . Arsenic determinations were made from toenail samples using neutron activation analysis . Water samples were analyzed using hydride-generation magnet sector inductively coupled mass spectrometry . Among 208 subjects with both toenail and water measurements , the correlation ( r ) between water and nail arsenic was 0.65 ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) among those with water arsenic concentrations of 1 microg/liter or higher and 0.08 ( p = 0.31 ) among those with concentrations below 1 microg/liter ( overall r = 0.46 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) . Our data suggest that toenail samples provide a useful biologic marker for quantifying low-level arsenic exposure .	24 12 1 123 241 2
24030503	BACKGROUND The toxic metal cadmium is suggested to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease , but only one incidence study has explored this association . We evaluated the association between quartiles of food frequency questionnaire-based estimates of cadmium exposure from food ( the predominant source of exposure to the metal ) and incident cardiovascular disease and its subtypes . METHODS From the population-based Swedish Mammography cohort , 33,333 women were followed prospectively from baseline ( 1997 ) through 2010 . We estimated relative risks ( RRs ) with 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) using Cox proportional hazard models . RESULTS During 12 years of follow-up , we identified 3155 incident cases of total cardiovascular disease ( 1322 cases of myocardial infarction and 1833 cases of total stroke [ 1485 ischemic and 208 hemorrhagic stroke] ) . Dietary cadmium exposure was not associated with risk of total cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction , or total stroke or its subtypes . For total cardiovascular disease , the multivariable-adjusted RR comparing the highest quartile of cadmium exposure with the lowest was 0.96 ( 95% CI = 0.85-1.09 ) . The corresponding RRs were 1.07 ( 0.88-1.29 ) for myocardial infarction , 0.90 ( 0.76-1.05 ) for total stroke , 0.89 ( 0.74-1.06 ) for ischemic stroke , and 1.11 ( 0.68-1.80 ) for hemorrhagic stroke . CONCLUSIONS Our study lends no support to an overall association between low-level exposure to cadmium via food and incident cardiovascular disease .	24 2 243
8793361	Ethylene oxide is a gas used in some dental offices to sterilize equipment . In pregnant laboratory animals , ethylene oxide increases malformations and feral loss . Increased gestation length has also been reported . In humans , two studies have reported increased spontaneous abortions among ethylene oxide-exposed women , but few other data exist . We sent questionnaires to 7,000 dental assistants , age 18-39 years , registered in California in 1987 ; 4,856 responded ( 69% ) . We based our analysis on 1,320 women whose most recent pregnancy was conceived while working full-time . Thirty-two women reported exposure to ethylene oxide ; unexposed dental assistants comprised the comparison group . We estimated relative risks of spontaneous abortion and preterm birth using a person-week model . We estimated relative risks of postterm birth ( &gt ; or = 42 weeks ) and a combined adverse outcomes model using logistic regression . Among exposed women , the age-adjusted relative risk of spontaneous abortion was 2.5 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.0-6.3 ] , for preterm birth 2.7 ( 95% CI = 0.8-8.8 ) , and for postterm birth 2.1 ( 95% CI = 0.7-5.9 ) . The estimated relative risk of any of these adverse outcomes among exposed women was 2.5 ( 95% CI = 1.0-6.1 ) after adjusting for age , nitrous oxide , and number of mercury amalgams prepared . These data further implicate ethylene oxide as a possible reproductive toxicant in humans .	11 1 112
23552989	Hyperuricemia in children is associated with increased risk of high blood pressure , metabolic syndrome , and future cardiovascular disease . Serum perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) levels have been shown to be positively associated with hyperuricemia in adults , but the association in children remains unexplored . We therefore examined the association between serum PFOA and PFOS levels and hyperuricemia in a representative sample of US children . A cross-sectional study was performed on 1,772 participants â¤18 years of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2003-2008 . The main outcome of interest was hyperuricemia , defined as serum uric acid levels â¥6 mg/dL . We found that serum levels of PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with hyperuricemia , independent of age , sex , race/ethnicity , body mass index , annual household income , physical activity , serum total cholesterol , and serum cotinine levels . Compared with subjects in quartile 1 ( referent ) , subjects in quartile 4 had multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for hyperuricemia of 1.62 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.10 , 2.37 ) for PFOA and 1.65 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.10 , 2.49 ) for PFOS . Our findings indicate that serum perfluoroalkyl chemical levels are significantly associated with hyperuricemia in children even at the lower " background " exposure levels of the US general population .	11 12 122 1 11122 1112 111
24023932	PURPOSE Noninfectious comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have become increasingly prevalent and occur earlier in life in persons with HIV infection . Despite the emerging body of literature linking environmental exposures to chronic disease outcomes in the general population , the impacts of environmental exposures have received little attention in HIV-infected population . The aim of this study is to investigate whether individuals living with HIV have elevated prevalence of heavy metals compared to non-HIV infected individuals in United States . METHODS We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 2003-2010 to compare exposures to heavy metals including cadmium , lead , and total mercury in HIV infected and non-HIV infected subjects . RESULTS In this cross-sectional study , we found that HIV-infected individuals had higher concentrations of all heavy metals than the non-HIV infected group . In a multivariate linear regression model , HIV status was significantly associated with increased blood cadmium ( p=0.03 ) after adjusting for age , sex , race , education , poverty income ratio , and smoking . However , HIV status was not statistically associated with lead or mercury levels after adjusting for the same covariates . CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that HIV-infected patients might be significantly more exposed to cadmium compared to non-HIV infected individuals which could contribute to higher prevalence of chronic diseases among HIV-infected subjects . Further research is warranted to identify sources of exposure and to understand more about specific health outcomes .	1 122 12
23555630	Adverse effects of prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners on postnatal brain development have been reported in a number of previous studies . However , few studies have examined the effects of prenatal PCB exposure on early social development . The present study sought to increase understanding of the neurotoxicity of PCBs by examining the relationship between PCB congener concentrations in umbilical cord blood and fixation patterns when observing upright and inverted biological motion ( BM ) at four-months after birth . The development of the ability to recognize BM stimuli is considered a hallmark of socio-cognitive development . The results revealed a link between dioxin-like PCB #118 concentration and fixation pattern . Specifically , four-month-olds with a low-level of prenatal exposure to PCB #118 exhibited a preference for the upright BM over inverted BM , whereas those with a relatively high-level of exposure did not . This finding supports the proposal that prenatal PCB exposure impairs the development of social functioning , and indicates the importance of congener-specific analysis in the risk analysis of the adverse effects of PCB exposure on the brain development .	11 1 122 12 112
10845782	Cadmium , zinc , and copper from placental tissue and blood samples at the first trimester ( n = 64 ) and at term ( n = 152 ) were analyzed ; the welfare of newborns and placental 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase ( ECOD ) activities in vitro were determined . The study material was collected from Finland , Estonia , and Russia . The results demonstrate that Cd starts to accumulate in the placenta during the first trimester and that Zn and Cu contents were significantly higher at the first trimester than at term . Among nonsmokers a negative correlation was found between placental Cu content and birth weight of neonates . Among smokers a positive correlation between placental Zn content and birth weight and ECOD activity was found . The birth weights correlated inversely with the length of time the mothers smoked . The highest Cd concentrations were detected in the samples collected from St. Petersburg . The data demonstrate an inverse accumulation of Zn and Cd throughout the pregnancy in the placenta and maternal blood samples . Zn may act as a positive marker or even an enzymatic enhancement for the human placental vital functions . Smoking , parity , age , and especially the place of residence affect the Cd , Zn , and Cu contents and ratios in placenta and mother's blood .	11 12 1113 1 122 111 126 112
24022669	When selecting the least biased exposure surrogate , for example , the concentration of a biomarker in a urine sample , information on variability must be taken into consideration . We used mixed-effects models to estimate the variability and determinants of urinary cadmium ( U-Cd ) excretion using spot urine samples collected at six fixed times during 2 days about 1 week apart , from 24 healthy non-smokers . The urine samples were analysed for U-Cd , the concentrations were adjusted for dilution , and the excretion rates were calculated . Between-individual variability dominated the total variability for most measures of U-Cd excretion , especially for 24âh urine and first morning samples . The U-Cd excretion showed a circadian rhythm during the day , and time point of sampling was a significant factor in the mixed-effects models , thus a standardised sampling time , such as first morning urine samples , needs to be applied . Gender , urinary flow rate , age , and urinary protein excretions were also significant determinants for U-Cd excretion . The choice of biomarker for U-Cd excretion was found to be more important in individually-based studies of exposure-response relationships than in studies of comparing Cd levels of groups . When planning a study , this variability of U-Cd in spot samples must be acknowledged .	1 12 127
24021707	BACKGROUND Available evidence concerning the association between air pollution and preeclampsia is limited , and specific associations with early- and late-onset preeclampsia have not been assessed . OBJECTIVES We investigated the association , if any , between preeclampsia ( all , early- , and late-onset ) and exposure to nitrogen dioxide , nitrogen oxides , particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter â¤ 2.5 Î¼m ( PM2.5 ; fine particles ) , â¤ 10 Î¼m , and 2.5-10 Î¼m , and PM2.5 light absorption ( a proxy for elemental carbon ) during the entire pregnancy and during the first , second , and third trimesters . METHODS This study was based on 8,398 pregnancies ( including 103 cases of preeclampsia ) among women residing in Barcelona , Spain ( 2000-2005 ) . We applied a spatiotemporal exposure assessment framework using land use regression models to predict ambient pollutant levels during each week of pregnancy at the geocoded residence address of each woman at the time of birth . Logistic and conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted associations . RESULTS We found positive associations for most of our evaluated outcome-exposure pairs , with the strongest associations observed for preeclampsia and late-onset preeclampsia in relation to the third-trimester exposure to fine particulate pollutants , and for early-onset preeclampsia in relation to the first-trimester exposure to fine particulate pollutants . Among our investigated associations , those of first- and third-trimester exposures to PM2.5 and third-trimester exposure to PM2.5 absorbance and all preeclampsia , and third-trimester PM2.5 exposure and late-onset preeclampsia attained statistical significance . CONCLUSION We observed increased risk of preeclampsia associated with exposure to fine particulate air pollution . Our findings , in combination with previous evidence suggesting distinct pathogenic mechanisms for early- and late-onset preeclampsia , support additional research on this topic .	11 23 1 2 112 231
10807040	The aim of this study was : ( a ) to estimate the concentration of total mercury in the renal cortex , liver , cerebellum and hair of 46 persons who died suddenly in the GdaÅsk region , northern Poland , between the ages of 17 and 90 ; and ( b ) to assess whether a correlation occurs between mercury content in the investigated biological media . The mean concentrations of mercury in the human hair , renal cortex , liver and cerebellum were : 378 +/- 315.4 ng/g ; 68.6 +/- 92.3 ng/g ; 29.9 +/- 22 ng/g and 5.3 +/- 6.9 ng/g respectively . Positive correlations were found between mercury levels in : cerebellum and liver ( r = 0.873 ) , cerebellum and hair ( r = 0.853 ) , cerebellum and renal cortex ( r = 0.578 ) , hair and liver ( r = 0.771 ) , hair and renal cortex ( r = 0.478 ) liver and renal cortex ( r = 0.66 ) . The geometric mean levels of mercury in the renal cortex , liver , cerebellum and hair in the residents of the GdaÅsk region are 15-19 times lower than in the population of Tokyo and its environs [ Suzuki T , Hongo T , Yoshinaga J et al . The hair-organ relationship in mercury concentration in contemporary Japanese . Arch Environ Health 1993;44:361-365 ] .	1 123 12 125
8677427	Human scalp hair mercury concentrations were determined in 219 hair samples from male individuals from different regions of Bangladesh . Total hair mercury concentrations were very low with a mean value of 0.44 +/- 0.19 micrograms Hg/g ( range 0.02-0.95 ) for a moderately elevated fish consumption averaging 2.1 kg/month ( range 1.4-2.6 ) . A highly significant positive correlation ( r = 0.88 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) was found between fish consumption and hair mercury concentration . Neither age , region nor occupation had any influence on the hair mercury content . Our results in agreement with literature values , are described by equation ( X = 183Y + 0.16 ) linking calculated daily methylmercury intake ( X , mg ) and hair total mercury level ( Y , micrograms/g ) . Low concentrations in hair were linked to extremely low levels of daily mercury intake , the determining factor being remarkably low mercury levels in Bangladesh fish .	24 12 1 123 243 2
23565277	In Guiyu , an electronic waste recycling site near Shantou , Guangdong province , China , primitive ways of e-waste processing have caused severe cadmium and lead pollution to the local residents . However , the possible effects of cadmium or lead pollution to genomic integrity of the local residents have not been investigated . We examined the possible relationship between cadmium and lead concentrations in placenta and placental telomere length in Guiyu and compared the data with that of a non-polluted town . Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and real-time PCR were used to determine placental cadmium and lead concentrations , and placental telomere length . We found that placental cadmium concentration was negatively correlated with placental telomere length ( râ=â-0.138 , pâ=â0.013 ) . We also found that placental cadmium concentration of 0.0294 Âµg/g might be a critical point at which attrition of placental telomere commenced . No significant correlation between placental lead concentration and placental telomere length was detected ( râ=â0.027 , pâ=â0.639 ) . Our data suggest that exposure to cadmium pollution during pregnancy may be a risk factor for shortened placental telomere length that is known to be related to cancer development and aging . Furthermore , grave consequence on the offspring from pregnancies in e-waste polluted area is indicated .	11 1111 12 1 111 126
24013868	BACKGROUND Several studies employing cell culture and animal models have suggested that arsenic ( As ) exposure induces global DNA hypomethylation . However , As has been associated with global DNA hypermethylation in human study populations . We hypothesized that this discrepancy may reflect a nonlinear relationship between As dose and DNA methylation . OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the dose-response relationship between As and global methylation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) DNA in apparently healthy Bangladeshi adults chronically exposed to a wide range of As concentrations in drinking water . METHODS Global PBMC DNA methylation , plasma folate , blood S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) , and concentrations of As in drinking water , blood , and urine were measured in 320 adults . DNA methylation was measured using the [ 3H]-methyl incorporation assay , which provides disintegration-per-minute ( DPM ) values that are negatively associated with global DNA methylation . RESULTS Water , blood , and urinary As were positively correlated with global PBMC DNA methylation ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) . In multivariable-adjusted models , 1-Î¼g/L increases in water and urinary As were associated with 27.6-unit ( 95% CI : 6.3 , 49.0 ) and 22.1-unit ( 95% CI : 0.5 , 43.8 ) decreases in DPM per microgram DNA , respectively . Categorical models indicated that estimated mean levels of PBMC DNA methylation were highest in participants with the highest As exposures . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that As is positively associated with global methylation of PBMC DNA over a wide range of drinking water As concentrations . Further research is necessary to elucidate underlying mechanisms and physiologic implications .	24 1111 12 1 122 2 241 127 11 111
8680832	Chlorinated biphenyl methylsulfones and biphenylols were determined in samples of human milk from Canadian donors . Fifty samples containing an average of 10.8 ng g-1 ( w/w ) of total PCBs were found to contain an average of 68 pg g-1 of chlorinated biphenyl methylsulfone . The major congeners were 3-methylsulfonyl-2,2',4',5,5',-pentachlorobiphenyl , 4-methylsulfonyl-2,2',3',4',5,-pentachlorobiphenyl and 4-methylsulfonyl-2,2',3',5,5',6'-hexachlorobiphenyl . Twelve of these samples were analyzed for five chlorinated biphenylols and the 4-methoxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptachlorobiphenylol congener was detected in all at an average concentration of 1.9 pg g-1 . The chlorinated biphenylols appear to be minor residual metabolites in human milk from the general population . The fifty samples with an average of 8.4 ng g-1 of p,p'-DDE also contained an average of 16.5 pg g-1 of the corresponding methylsulfone . Both the total PCB methylsulfone and p,p ' DDE methylsulfone were correlated with total PCB and p,p ' DDE contents , respectively .	1 12 124
10706533	Methylmercury is a neurotoxin at high exposures , and the developing fetus is particularly susceptible . Because exposure to methylmercury is primarily through fish , concern has been expressed that the consumption of fish by pregnant women could adversely affect their fetuses . The reference dose for methylmercury established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was based on a benchmark analysis of data from a poisoning episode in Iraq in which mothers consumed seed grain treated with methylmercury during pregnancy . However , exposures in this study were short term and at much higher levels than those that result from fish consumption . In contrast , the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ATSDR ) based its proposed minimal risk level on a no-observed-adverse-effect level ( NOAEL ) derived from neurologic testing of children in the Seychelles Islands , where fish is an important dietary staple . Because no adverse effects from mercury were seen in the Seychelles study , the ATSDR considered the mean exposure in the study to be a NOAEL . However , a mean exposure may not be a good indicator of a no-effect exposure level . To provide an alternative basis for deriving an appropriate human exposure level from the Seychelles study , we conducted a benchmark analysis on these data . Our analysis included responses from batteries of neurologic tests applied to children at 6 , 19 , 29 , and 66 months of age . We also analyzed developmental milestones ( age first walked and first talked ) . We explored a number of dose-response models , sets of covariates to include in the models , and definitions of background response . Our analysis also involved modeling responses expressed as both continuous and quantal data . The most reliable analyses were considered to be represented by 144 calculated lower statistical bounds on the benchmark dose ( BMDLs ; the lower statistical bound on maternal mercury hair level corresponding to an increase of 0.1 in the probability of an adverse response ) derived from the modeling of continuous responses . The average value of the BMDL in these 144 analyses was 25 ppm mercury in maternal hair , with a range of 19 to 30 ppm .	11 1 123 12 112
8876800	To study genotoxic effects of exposure to low levels of benzene , single-strand breaks ( SSB ) in DNA of leukocytes and urinary levels of the oxidative DNA adduct 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8OHdG ) were determined in 33 men occupationally exposed to benzene from gasoline and in 33 controls . The average exposure to benzene over a shift was determined by personal air sampling in the breathing zone . The 8-hr time-weighted average exposure to benzene was 0.13 ppm ( mean value , range 0.003-0.6 ppm ) . Exposed workers had a significant increase of SSB ( p = 0.04 ) over the shift compared with controls . Storage time of the samples seemed to affect the results . An analysis of samples with the same storage time showed a nonsignificant increase among the workers compared with controls . Urinary 8OHdG increased over the shift among the exposed workers but not among the controls . The highest values among the exposed workers were seen in late evening , with a slight decrease the next morning . Multiple linear analysis adjusting for smoking habits showed a significant association between the exposure level of benzene during the shift and the increase of 8OHdG in the urine over the shift among exposed workers ( p = 0.02 ) . These findings indicate a genotoxic effect in humans of benzene at relatively low exposure levels , that is , about 0.1 ppm ( 0.3 mg/m3 ) .	11 1111 23 1 11122 1112 111 1114 2 233
10576099	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were detected in 13 human adipose tissue samples from Spain , 3 women and 10 men . Tetra- , penta- and hexabrominated diphenyl ethers were determined at ng/g lipid ( ppb ) level in all the samples . The average TeBDE level was 1.36 ng/g , the average PeBDE was 0.93 ng/g and the HxBDE 1.83 ng/g . Human adipose tissue levels of PBDE obtained in the current samples from Spain are comparable with the tissue levels reported in recent Swedish investigations .	1 121 12
23601780	Contribution of diet and selected risk factors to the levels of four polyfluorinated compounds was evaluated . Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the years 2003-2008 were used . Dietary factors accounted for 10.4% to 21.2% of the explained variation . Amount of milk consumed was found to be positively associated ( p&lt;0.01 ) with perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) but negatively associated with perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) ( p&lt;0.01 ) . Amount of meat and fish consumed was positively associated ( p&lt;0.01 ) with PFNA and PFOS . Amount of non-alcoholic beverages consumed was positively associated ( p&lt;0.01 ) with PFNA and PFOA . Levels of PFOS increased ( p&lt;0.01 ) with increase in the amount of alcoholic beverages consumed . Total amount of alcohol consumed was positively associated ( p&lt;0.01 ) with PFNA . Levels of both PFOA and PFOS decreased with increase in total amount of caffeine consumed . Total amount of fat consumed was negatively associated with PFNA and positively associated with PFOS . Total calories consumed were negatively associated with perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS ) and PFOS but positively associated with PFNA . New to this study , positive correlations ( p&lt;0.01 ) between serum cholesterol and PFNA , PFOA , and PFOS were found . Serum albumin levels were negatively correlated with PFHxS but positively correlated with PFOA and PFOS . Males had statistically significantly higher levels of all four PFCs as compared to females and Mexican Americans had the lowest levels of all four PFCs than other race/ethnic groups . Levels of all four PFCs increased with increase in family income . Body mass index was negatively correlated with PFNA but positively associated with PFOA . There was a statistically significant decrease in the levels of PFOS over survey years 2003-2008 .	24 11 12 1 11121 122 11123 111 243 2 1112
10535124	In 1995 , a petroleum marketer introduced a diesel fuel additive in the UK containing Mn as MMT ( methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl ) . A small study of personal exposures to airborne Mn in London was conducted before and after introduction of the additive to identify any major impact of the additive on exposures . In 1995 , personal exposures to Mn were measured in two groups , taxi drivers and office workers ( 10 subjects per group ) for two consecutive 7-day periods . A similar study was carried out in 1996 to determine if exposures had changed . Samples were also analyzed for Ca , Al , Mg and Pb . In 1996 , exposures to aerosol mass as total suspended particulates ( TSP ) and PM2.5 were measured in addition to the metals . Manganese exposures in this cohort did not increase as a result of introduction of the additive . However , a significant source of Mn exposure was discovered during the conduct of these tests . The mean exposure to Mn was higher among the office workers in both years than that of the taxi drivers . This was due to the fact that approximately half of the office workers commuted via the underground railway system where airborne dust and metal concentrations are significantly elevated over those in the general environment . Similar results have been noted in other cities having underground rail systems . Exposure to Mn , Pb , Ca , and Mg were not significantly different between the 2 years . Taxi drivers had higher exposures than office workers to Mg and Pb in both years . Commuting via the underground also had a significant impact on exposures to TSP , PM2.5 , Al , and Ca , but had little effect on exposures to Mg . The aerosol in the underground was particularly enriched in Mn , approximately 10-fold , when compared to the aerosol in the general environment . There are several possible sources for this Mn , including mechanical wear of the steel wheels on the steel rais , vaporization of metal from sparking of the third rail , or brake wear .	2 233 23
23602893	BACKGROUND We previously demonstrated that carriers of the " slower metabolizer " MM genotype of paraoxonase ( PON1 ) who were also exposed to ambient organophosphate ( OP ) pesticides at their residences were at increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease ( PD ) . Here , with a larger sample size , we extend our previous investigation to consider additional sources of ambient exposure and examined two additional functional PON1 variants . METHODS From 2001 to 2011 , we enrolled incident cases of idiopathic PD and population controls living in central California . We genotyped three well-known functional PON1 SNPs : two exonic polymorphisms ( PON1L55M and PON1Q192R ) and the promoter region variant ( PON1C-108T ) . Ambient exposures to diazinon , chlorpyrifos , and parathion at residential and workplace addresses were assessed using a validated geographic information system-based model incorporating records of agricultural pesticide applications in California . RESULTS The odds ratio ( OR ) for Caucasians exposed to OPs at either residential or workplace addresses varied by PON1 genotype ; for exposed carriers of the " faster " metabolizer genotypes , ML or LL , we estimated lower odds ratios ( range , 1.20-1.39 ) than for exposed carriers of the " slower " metabolizer genotype MM ( range , 1.78-2.45 ) relative to unexposed carriers of the faster genotypes . We observed similarly increased ORs for exposure across PON1Q192R genotypes , but no differences across PON1C-108T genotypes . The largest ORs were estimated for exposed carriers of both PON1192QQ and PON155MM ( OR range , 2.84-3.57 ) . CONCLUSIONS Several functional PON1 variants may act together to modify PD risk for ambient OP exposures . While either PON1L55M or PON1Q192R may be sufficient to identify increased susceptibility , carriers of both slow metabolizer variants seem most susceptible to OP exposures .	2 231 23
23608001	Cadmium , an environmental pollutant , may act like an estrogen and be a potential risk factor for estrogen-dependent diseases such as breast cancer . We examined the hypothesis that higher dietary cadmium intake is associated with risk of overall and hormone receptor-defined breast cancer in Japanese women , a population with a relatively high cadmium intake . The study was conducted under a case-control design in 405 eligible matched pairs from May 2001 to September 2005 at four hospitals in Nagano Prefecture , Japan . Dietary cadmium intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire . Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) of breast cancer and its hormone-receptor-defined subtypes were calculated by tertile of dietary cadmium intake . We found no significant association between dietary cadmium and risk of total breast cancer in either crude or multivariable-adjusted analysis . Adjusted ORs for tertiles of cadmium intake were 1.00 , 1.19 , and 1.23 ( 95% CI , 0.76-2.00 ; P for trend=0.39 ) for whole breast cancer . Further , no significant associations were seen across strata of menopausal status , smoking , and diabetes in multivariable-adjusted models except for adjusted OR for continuous cadmium intake in postmenopausal women . A statistically significant association was found for estrogen receptor-positive ( ER+ ) tumors among postmenopausal women ( adjusted OR=1.00 , 1.16 , and 1.94 [ 95% CI , 1.04-3.63 ; P for trend=0.032] ) . Although the present study found no overall association between dietary cadmium intake and breast cancer risk , higher cadmium intake was associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer in postmenopausal women , at least at regular intake levels in Japanese women in the general population . Further studies are needed to confirm this association .	24 2 243
23979675	Sweet potatoes are a staple in the diet of some people and an excellent source of minerals . Metal monitoring in food , like sweet potatoes , provides basic information on safety aspects in regulatory processes as well as nutritional values . One hundred five samples of three varieties of sweet potatoes were randomly obtained from supermarkets , farmers markets , and farmers ' plots in Tenerife ( Canary Islands , Spain ) . The edible portion ( pulp ) was the only part considered for analysis . Flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the contents of sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , calcium ( Ca ) , magnesium ( Mg ) , copper ( Cu ) , iron ( Fe ) , manganese ( Mn ) , and zinc ( Zn ) , while the levels of chromium ( Cr ) , nickel ( Ni ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , and lead ( Pb ) were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry . The mean concentrations were 500 Na , 4409 K , 564 Ca , 609Mg , 1.291 Cu , 6.554 Fe , 2.324 Mn , 2.348 Zn , 0.028 Cr , 0.048 Ni , 0.001 Cd , and 0.003 Pbmg/kg , respectively . Potassium presented the highest contents in all varieties of sweet potatoes . Iron was the most abundant microelement . The orange fleshed sweet potato variety offered greater nutritional contributions to the recommended intakes than the rest of the varieties studied . The estimated mean daily intake of Ni ( 0.72mg/day ) detected in our samples was highly consistent with other studies . Average daily intakes of Cd ( 0.015Î¼g/day ) and Pb ( 0.045Î¼g/day ) were below toxicological reference values . In conclusion , the levels of Cd and Pb detected in the sweet potatoes analyzed do not represent any toxicological risk to consumers .	24 2 243
23623596	PURPOSE The aim of this study was to design the optimized laboratory protocol as a tool for human biomonitoring of selected Persistent Organic Pollutants ( POPs ) in Poland . In this study , we present the method developed for the determination of 29 congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dl-PCBs ) , as well as individual results of the measurements in 40 human breast milk samples collected in central Poland in 2008-2010 . METHODS The protocol of sample preparation and quantitative analysis of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs was optimized for the isotopic dilution method with high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry HRGC/HRMS . Fat content in the extracts was determined gravimetrically . The results were corrected by fat content in the samples . RESULTS The average sum of PCDD/F and dl-PCBs in the human milk samples from the urban area was 7.429 WHO-TEQpg/g fat ( with the range 0.431-14.27 ) , and in the rural area it was 6.448pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 0.539-12.61 ) . CONCLUSIONS The results obtained in this study indicate that the mothers were exposed uniformly to PCDD/Fs and PCBs regardless of location . The significant difference of p&lt;0.1 between the milk samples from the urban and rural mothers in 2,3,7,8-TCDD ; 1,2,37,8,9-HxCDD and 2,3,4,6,7-HxCDF were observed . For the other 14 PCDD/F and 12 dl-PCB congeners , the observed differences were not significant . The total WHO-TEQ values are lower in comparison with the average results in Europe from the fourth round of a WHO-coordinated study .	1 12 124
23967108	BACKGROUND Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear . OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in genes associated with diabetes and arsenic exposure in drinking water on the risk of developing T2DM . METHODS In 2009-2011 , we conducted a follow up study of 957 Bangladeshi adults who participated in a case-control study of arsenic-induced skin lesions in 2001-2003 . Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between 38 SNPs in 18 genes and risk of T2DM measured at follow up . T2DM was defined as having a blood hemoglobin A1C level greater than or equal to 6.5% at follow-up . Arsenic exposure was characterized by drinking water samples collected from participants ' tubewells . False discovery rates were applied in the analysis to control for multiple comparisons . RESULTS Median arsenic levels in 2001-2003 were higher among diabetic participants compared with non-diabetic ones ( 71.6 Âµg/L vs. 12.5 Âµg/L , p-value &lt;0.001 ) . Three SNPs in ADAMTS9 were nominally associated with increased risk of T2DM ( rs17070905 , Odds Ratio ( OR ) â=â2.30 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 1.17-4.50 ; rs17070967 , ORâ=â2.02 , 95%CI 1.00-4.06 ; rs6766801 , ORâ=â2.33 , 95%CI 1.18-4.60 ) , but these associations did not reach the statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons . A significant interaction between arsenic and NOTCH2 ( rs699780 ) was observed which significantly increased the risk of T2DM ( p for interactionâ=â0.003 ; q-valueâ=â0.021 ) . Further restricted analysis among participants exposed to water arsenic of less than 148 Âµg/L showed consistent results for interaction between the NOTCH2 variant and arsenic exposure on T2DM ( p for interaction â=â0.048 ; q-valueâ=â0.004 ) . CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that genetic variation in NOTCH2 increased susceptibility to T2DM among people exposed to inorganic arsenic . Additionally , genetic variants in ADAMTS9 may increase the risk of T2DM .	11 24 1 2 111 11123 241 1112
23624243	Perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA , ' C8' ) and perfluoroctane sulphonate ( PFOS ) are environmentally stable compounds with industrial and consumer uses and long half-lives in humans . Concern has been raised over chronic exposure effects to human health , especially in relation to cholesterol metabolism . Here , we explore the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and the in vivo expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism . We studied 290 individuals exposed to background levels of PFOS and elevated concentrations of PFOA through drinking water . Using adjusted linear regression models , we found inverse associations between serum PFOA levels and the whole blood expression level of genes involved in cholesterol transport ( NR1H2 , NPC1 and ABCG1 ; p=0.002 , 0.026 and 0.014 respectively ) . A positive association was seen between PFOS and a transcript involved in cholesterol mobilisation ( NCEH1 ; p=0.018 ) , and a negative relationship with a transcript involved in cholesterol transport ( NR1H3 ; p=0.044 ) . When sexes were analysed separately , reductions in the levels of mRNAs involved in cholesterol transport were seen with PFOA in men ( NPC1 , ABCG1 , and PPARA ; p=0.025 , 0.024 and 0.012 respectively ) and in women ( NR1H2 expression ; p=0.019 ) , whereas an increase in the levels of a cholesterol mobilisation transcript ( NCEH1 ; p=0.036 ) was noted in women alone . PFOS was positively associated with expression of genes involved in both cholesterol mobilisation and transport in women ( NCEH1 and PPARA ; p=0.003 and 0.039 respectively ) , but no effects were evident in men . This is the first report of associations between the in vivo expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and exposure to PFOA or PFOS , suggested that exposure to these compounds may promote a hypercholesterolaemic environment , with wider implications for human disease .	11 1111 12 1 122 111
23942273	BACKGROUND Maternal urinary biomarkers are often used to assess fetal exposure to phenols and their precursors . Their effectiveness as a measure of exposure in epidemiological studies depends on their variability during pregnancy and their ability to accurately predict fetal exposure . OBJECTIVES We assessed the relationship between urinary and amniotic fluid concentrations of nine environmental phenols , and the reproducibility of urinary concentrations , among pregnant women . METHODS Seventy-one women referred for amniocentesis were included . Maternal urine was collected at the time of the amniocentesis appointment and on two subsequent occasions . Urine and amniotic fluid were analyzed for 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenols , bisphenol A , benzophenone-3 , triclosan , and methyl- , ethyl- , propyl- , and butylparabens using online solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry . RESULTS Only benzophenone-3 and propylparaben were detectable in more than half of the amniotic fluid samples ; for these phenols , concentrations in amniotic fluid and maternal urine collected on the same day were positively correlated ( Ï = 0.53 and 0.32 , respectively ) . Other phenols were detected infrequently in amniotic fluid ( e.g. , bisphenol A was detected in only two samples ) . The intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) of urinary concentrations in samples from individual women ranged from 0.48 and 0.62 for all phenols except bisphenol A ( ICC = 0.11 ) . CONCLUSION Amniotic fluid detection frequencies for most phenols were low . The reproducibility of urine measures was poor for bisphenol A , but good for the other phenols . Although a single sample may provide a reasonable estimate of exposure for some phenols , collecting multiple urine samples during pregnancy is an option to reduce exposure measurement error in studies regarding the effects of phenol prenatal exposure on health .	1 12 125 127
23632126	BACKGROUND Laboratory studies suggest that fine particulate matter ( â¤ 2.5 Âµm in diameter ; PM(2.5) ) can activate pathophysiological responses that may induce insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes . However , epidemiological evidence relating PM2.5 and diabetes is sparse , particularly for incident diabetes . OBJECTIVES We conducted a population-based cohort study to determine whether long-term exposure to ambient PM(2.5) is associated with incident diabetes . METHODS We assembled a cohort of 62,012 nondiabetic adults who lived in Ontario , Canada , and completed one of five population-based health surveys between 1996 and 2005 . Follow-up extended until 31 December 2010 . Incident diabetes diagnosed between 1996 and 2010 was ascertained using the Ontario Diabetes Database , a validated registry of persons diagnosed with diabetes ( sensitivity = 86% , specificity = 97% ) . Six-year average concentrations of PM2.5 at the postal codes of baseline residences were derived from satellite observations . We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the associations , adjusting for various individual-level risk factors and contextual covariates such as smoking , body mass index , physical activity , and neighborhood-level household income . We also conducted multiple sensitivity analyses . In addition , we examined effect modification for selected comorbidities and sociodemographic characteristics . RESULTS There were 6,310 incident cases of diabetes over 484,644 total person-years of follow-up . The adjusted hazard ratio for a 10-Âµg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) was 1.11 ( 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.21 ) . Estimated associations were comparable among all sensitivity analyses . We did not find strong evidence of effect modification by comorbidities or sociodemographic covariates . CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that long-term exposure to PM2.5 may contribute to the development of diabetes .	2 231 23
8959409	Inorganic arsenic ( In-As ) , an occupational and environmental human carcinogen , undergoes biomethylation to monomethylarsonate ( MMA ) and dimethylarsinate ( DMA ) . It has been proposed that saturation of methylation capacity at high exposure levels may lead to a threshold for the carcinogenicity of In-As . The relative distribution of urinary In-As , MMA , and DMA is used as a measure of human methylation capacity . The most common pathway for elevated environmental exposure to In-As worldwide is through drinking water . We conducted a biomarker study in northern Chile of a population chronically exposed to water naturally contaminated with high arsenic content ( 600 micrograms/l ) . In this paper we present the results of a prospective follow-up of 73 exposed individuals , who were provided with water of lower arsenic content ( 45 micrograms/l ) for 2 months . The proportions of In-As , MMA , and DMA in urine were compared before and after intervention , and the effect of other factors on the distribution of arsenic metabolites was also analyzed . The findings of this study indicate that the decrease in arsenic exposure was associated with a small decrease in the percent In-As in urine ( from 17.8% to 14.6% ) and in the MMA/DMA ratio ( from 0.23 to 0.18 ) . Other factors such as smoking , gender , age , years of residence , and ethnicity were associated mainly with changes in the MMA/DMA ratio , with smoking having the strongest effect . Nevertheless , the factors investigated accounted for only about 20% of the large interindividual variability observed . Genetic polymorphisms in As-methylating enzymes and other co-factors are likely to contribute to some of the unexplained variation . The changes observed in the percent In-As and in the MMA/DMA ratio do not support an exposure-based threshold for arsenic methylation in humans .	24 1111 12 1 2 241 127 11 111
23939041	Analysis of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , 20 organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and 18 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were performed on eggs from three different production types ( conventional , free-run and organic ) collected from the markets of the Canary Islands ( Spain ) . Unlike other studies we did not found differences in the content of PCBs or OCPs of eggs in relation to its production type . Median âOCPs content was 3.87 ng gâ»Â¹ fat , being dieldrin , dicofol , hexachlorobenzene , p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT the most frequently detected . Median âPCBs value was 3.93 ng gâ»Â¹ fat , with 79.9% of this amount coming from the marker PCBs . Two samples , one free-run and one organic , greatly exceeded the current European Commission ( EC ) limit of 2.5 pg TEQ(PCDD/F) gâ»Â¹ lipid , but the rest were well below of this limit . The concentrations of PAHs in conventionally produced eggs were almost 4 times higher than in free-run or organic eggs . Mean dietary intake estimates of the organochlorine contaminants based on consumption of eggs , regardless of the type chosen , is negligible for the Canary Islands ' population . However , the median dietary intake estimates of PAHs greatly depend on the type of eggs chosen , being much lower when free-run and organic eggs are consumed .	24 2 243
8885424	Monitoring of environmental and human exposure to mercury in the Nungwe Bay area of the Lake Victoria goldfields , Tanzania , has revealed low mercury concentrations in fish ( range : 1.8-16.9 ppb , mean : 7.0 ppb ) and human hair ( range : 156-5433 ppb , mean : 947 ppb ) that represent background levels . Gold mining has not produced a significant increase in environmental methylmercury that is available for bioaccummulation in aquatic food chains . Urinary mercury levels in gold mine workers frequently exposed to Hg vapour in amalgamation and burning of amalgam were significantly higher ( mean : 241 ng/ml ) than those in the general mine population not occupational exposed to Hg ( mean : 2.6 ng/ml ) . Rotation of mine duties reduced Hg exposure levels and hence the risk of intoxication in the gold mine workers . The lowest urinary and hair mercury levels were found in the Nungwe Bay fishing village population . This was consistent with the low mercury content of fish consumed by the inhabitants of the Nungwe Bay .	24 12 1 123 243 127 2
8931347	The issue of adverse health effects from dental amalgam and the concurrent low-dose exposure to inorganic mercury have been scrutinized by several Swedish expert groups during the past years . Only rarely have amalgam fillings in children been related to health effects . Experimental studies in genetically disposed animals have shown that low doses of inorganic mercury can induce autoimmune glomerulonephritis . The present case-control study included 31 children with acute glomerulonephritis and 33 with Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura retrieved from an in-patient register for the period 1973-1992 at the county hospital in Halmstad , Sweden . The median age was 10 and 9 years , respectively , for the two diagnostic groups . Dental clinics reported amalgam burden of the patients during the year before the date of diagnosis . Corresponding data were obtained for three randomly selected controls for each case , drawn from the case records of the same dental clinics , with matching for age and sex . Odds ratios ( 95% confidence interval ) were 1.42 ( 0.49 , 4.11 ) for Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura , 0.59 ( 0.25 , 1.38 ) for acute glomerulonephritis and 0.84 ( 0.40 , 1.75 ) for both diseases combined . The results of this study did not indicate increased disease risk in relation to amalgam burden .	24 244 2
10361026	For the purpose of examining the association between blood lead levels and household-specific soil lead levels , we used a multivariate linear regression model to find a slope factor relating soil lead levels to blood lead levels . We used previously collected data from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's ( ATSDR's ) multisite lead and cadmium study . The data included the blood lead measurements ( 0.5 to 40.2 microg/dL ) of 1015 children aged 6-71 months , and corresponding household-specific environmental samples . The environmental samples included lead in soil ( 18.1-9980 mg/kg ) , house dust ( 5.2-71,000 mg/kg ) , interior paint ( 0-16.5 mg/cm2 ) , and tap water ( 0.3-103 microg/L ) . After adjusting for income , education of the parents , presence of a smoker in the household , sex , and dust lead , and using a double log transformation , we found a slope factor of 0.1388 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.09-0.19 for the dose-response relationship between the natural log of the soil lead level and the natural log of the blood lead level . The predicted blood lead level corresponding to a soil lead level of 500 mg/kg was 5.99 microg/kg with a 95% prediction interval of 2. 08-17.29 . Predicted values and their corresponding prediction intervals varied by covariate level . The model shows that increased soil lead level is associated with elevated blood leads in children , but that predictions based on this regression model are subject to high levels of uncertainty and variability .	24 245 12 1 244 122 2 241 242
23928038	Persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , and organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) are of global concern because of their widespread contamination and adverse health effects . Potential endocrine disruption , especially of thyroid status by PCBs has been repeatedly suggested in both experimental and epidemiological studies . However the associations with PBDEs or OCPs have been arguable especially in human populations . We investigated the associations between major groups of POPs and thyroid hormone balances among pregnant women . One hundred five pregnant women at delivery were recruited from four cities of Korea in 2011 and were investigated . Blood samples were collected within a day before delivery . Serum was then analyzed for 19 PCBs , 19 PBDEs , and 19 OCPs , along with five thyroid hormones ( free and total T3 and T4 , and TSH ) . Several PCBs such as PCB28 , 52 , and 118 showed negative associations with T3 or T4 . BDE47 and total PBDEs showed significant associations with T3 or T4 . For OCPs , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes ( DDTs ) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) were generally associated with reduction of T3 or T4 . The thyroid hormone levels of all subjects were within the reference range , however exposure to several target POPs were clearly related with potential for disrupting thyroid hormone balance among pregnant women , at the current level of exposure . Although subtle , the changes in thyroid hormones should be seen with caution because even minor changes within pregnant women may have significant consequences especially on sensitive population like fetus .	11 12 11122 1 122 11123 111 1112
10361024	Hettstedt , a city in eastern Germany with a long history of mining and smelting of nonferrous ores , has several industrial sources of heavy metals . The indoor exposure to metals of children ( 5 to 14 years old ) in the Hettstedt area was assessed by measuring the levels of lead , cadmium , and arsenic contamination in sedimented house dust . Factors which influence the dust loading rate and the surface loading rates of these contaminants in house dust were investigated . The geometric mean of the dust loading rate was 8.9 mg/m2 day . The geometric means of surface loading rates were 1.14 , 0. 024 , and 0.023 microg/m2 day for lead , cadmium , and arsenic , respectively . Factors that were significantly associated with surface loading rates included the city area of residence , automobile traffic near home , parent with occupational exposure to heavy metals , type of heating , housing characteristics , whether child's home is damp , number of persons living in the child's home , and parents ' education . The most significant of these factors was the city area of residence , which reflects the distance from the metal sources ; this factor accounted for about half of the variances explained by the regression models .	24 2 242
23658832	The air quality in Beijing , especially its PM2.5 level , has become of increasing public concern because of its importance and sensitivity related to health risks . A set of monitored PM2.5 data from 31 stations , released for the first time by the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau , covering 37 days during autumn 2012 , was processed using spatial interpolation and overlay analysis . Following analyses of these data , a distribution map of cumulative exceedance days of PM2.5 and a temporal variation map of PM2.5 for Beijing have been drawn . Computational and analytical results show periodic and directional trends of PM2.5 spreading and congregating in space , which reveals the regulation of PM2.5 overexposure on a discontinuous medium-term scale . With regard to the cumulative effect of PM2.5 on the human body , the harm from lower intensity overexposure in the medium term , and higher overexposure in the short term , are both obvious . Therefore , data of population distribution were integrated into the aforementioned PM2.5 spatial spectrum map . A spatial statistical analysis revealed the patterns of PM2.5 gross exposure and exposure probability of residents in the Beijing urban area . The methods and conclusions of this research reveal relationships between long-term overexposure to PM2.5 and people living in high-exposure areas of Beijing , during the autumn of 2012 .	2 231 23
10350189	Our objective was to evaluate the activities of some enzymes of the heme biosynthesis pathway and their relationship with the profile of urinary porphyrin excretion in individuals exposed chronically to arsenic ( As ) via drinking water in Region Lagunera , Mexico . We selected 17 individuals from each village studied : Benito Juarez , which has current exposure to 0.3 mg As/l ; Santa Ana , where individuals have been exposed for more than 35 years to 0.4 mg As/l , but due to changes in the water supply ( in 1992 ) exposure was reduced to its current level ( 0.1 mg As/l ) , and Nazareno , with 0.014 mg As/l . Average arsenic concentrations in urine were 2058 , 398 , and 88 microg As/g creatinine , respectively . The more evident alterations in heme metabolism observed in the highly exposed individuals were : ( 1 ) small but significant increases in porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBG-D ) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase ( URO-D ) activities in peripheral blood erythrocytes ; ( 2 ) increases in the urinary excretion of total porphyrins , mainly due to coproporphyrin III ( COPROIII ) and uroporphyrin III ( UROIII ) ; and ( 3 ) increases in the COPRO/URO and COPROIII/COPROI ratios . No significant changes were observed in uroporphyrinogen III synthetase ( UROIII-S ) activity . The direct relationships between enzyme activities and urinary porphyrins , suggest that the increased porphyrin excretion was related to PBG-D , whereas the increased URO-D activity would enhance coproporphyrin synthesis and excretion at the expense of uroporphyrin . None of the human studies available have reported the marked porphyric response and enzyme inhibition observed in rodents . In conclusion , chronic As exposure alters human heme metabolism ; however the severity of the effects appears to depend on characteristics of exposure not yet fully characterized .	11 24 12 1113 1 11122 2 241 127 111 1112
10231987	Through 1996 into 1997 , a spot investigation on mercury contamination was conducted three times in Tanzania , especially around the Lake Victoria . A total of 150 goldminers , 103 fishermen and their families , and 19 residents of Mwanza City volunteered for the current study . A high total mercury level of 48.3 ppm ( near to 50 ppm , a critical level of Minamata disease ) and over in the head hair was observed in six goldminers ( highest value , 953 ppm ) , four fishermen and their families ( highest value , 416 ppm ) , and four Mwanza people ( highest value , 474 ppm ) . With the exception of these 14 subjects , however , each mean total mercury level was well within the normal range ( below 10 ppm ) . Out of the goldminers examined , 14 cases were diagnosed as a mild form of inorganic-mercury poisoning according to their clinical symptoms ( such as polyneuropathy mercurialis , neuroasthemia , or tremor mercurialis ) and the low ratio of methylmercury to total mercury , whereas neither inorganic-mercury poisoning nor methylmercury poisoning ( Minamata disease ) was noted in the fishermen and their families or in the Mwanza people . In addition , some subjects who showed a high total mercury level made habitual use of toilet soap containing much mercury . The findings obtained suggest that the mercury pollution in Tanzania is not very serious , however , it should be observed continuously .	11 1 123 12 112
10210688	Fine particle concentration ( i.e. , particles &lt;2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ; PM2.5 ) , but not coarse particle concentration , was associated with increased mortality in six U.S. cities . Others criticized this result , arguing that it could result from differences in measurement error between the two size ranges . Fine particles are primarily from combustion of fossil fuel , whereras coarse particles ( i.e. , particles between 2.5 and 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter ) are all crustal material , i.e. , dust . One way to determine if coarse particles are a risk for mortality is to identify episodes of high concentrations of coarse , but not fine , particles . Spokane , Washington , is located in an arid area and is subject to occasional dust storms after crops have been harvested . Between 1989 and 1995 , we identified 17 dust storms in Spokane . The 24-hr mean PM10 concentration during those storms was 263 microg/m3 . Using control dates that were the same day of the year in other years ( but with no dust storm on that day ) and that had a mean PM10 concentration of 42 microg/m3 , we compared the rate of nonaccidental deaths on the episode versus nonepisode days . There was little evidence of any risk [ relative risk ( RR ) = 1.00 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.81-1.22 ] on the episode days . Defining episode deaths as those occurring on the same or following day as the dust storm produced similar results ( RR = 1.01 ; CI , 0.87-1.17 ) . Sensitivity analyses , which tested more extensive seasonal control , produced smaller estimates . We conclude that coarse particles from windblown dust are not associated with mortality risk .	2 231 23
10092429	Fishing and fish consumption are widely practiced among members of certain ethnocultural groups . Informal assessment led us to ascribe high levels of consumption of locally caught sportfish to Montrealers of Asian origin and to hypothesize that their choices of species and fish organs differ from those of the majority group . An exploratory assessment of contaminant bioindicators reflective of St. Lawrence River fish consumption was conducted in late 1995 among nine Vietnamese and nine Bangladeshi Montreal sportfishers identified by community contacts . Vietnamese participants , six men and three women , were 27-70 ( median 36 ) years of age and had immigrated to Canada 3-20 ( median 7 ) years earlier . In contrast , the nine Bangladeshi males aged 28-41 ( median 34 ) years had been in Canada for 2-13 ( median 4 ) years . Bio-indicator concentrations among Bangladeshi and Vietnamese participants are compared to those found for majority-community Montreal-area high-level consumers recruited on the St. Lawrence River during winter 1995 . All results are presented as the median and 90th percentile . Hair mercury concentrations were higher for both Vietnamese ( 1.2 , 4.6 microgram/g ) and Bangladeshis ( 1.1 , 2.3 microgram/g ) than for majority-community sportfishers ( 0.7 , 1.9 microgram/g ) . Certain organochlorine levels , specifically total PCB ( estimated by plasma Aroclor 1260 ) , p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDE , and B-BHC , were highest in the Bangladeshis compared to Vietnamese and to majority-community sportfishers . In contrast , plasma levels of other pesticides were low in all three groups , including mirex , chlordane , and cis-nonachlor . A correlation between plasma p,p'-DDT levels and recency of arrival in Canada was found for the Bangladeshis . These data suggest a distinct pattern of tissue organochlorines , which we postulate relates to exposure prior to arrival in Canada and perhaps to the ongoing consumption of foods ( other than St. Lawrence River sportfish ) specific to these groups .	24 12 1 122 123 243 2
23673461	Airborne particulate matter ( PM ) components from fossil fuel combustion can induce oxidative stress initiated by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Reported associations between worsening asthma and PM2.5 mass could be related to PM oxidative potential to induce airway oxidative stress and inflammation ( hallmarks of asthma pathology ) . We followed 45 schoolchildren with persistent asthma in their southern California homes daily over 10 days with offline fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FENO ) , a biomarker of airway inflammation . Ambient exposures included daily average PM2.5 , PM2.5 elemental and organic carbon ( EC , OC ) , NO2 , O3 , and endotoxin . We assessed PM2.5 oxidative potential using both an abiotic and an in vitro bioassay on aqueous extracts of daily particle filters : ( 1 ) dithiothreitol ( DTT ) assay ( abiotic ) , representing chemically produced ROS ; and ( 2 ) ROS generated intracellularly in a rat alveolar macrophage model using the fluorescent probe 2'7'-dicholorohidroflourescin diacetate . We analyzed relations of FENO to air pollutants in mixed linear regression models . FENO was significantly positively associated with lag 1-day and 2-day averages of traffic-related markers ( EC , OC , and NO2 ) , DTT and macrophage ROS , but not PM2.5 mass . DTT associations were nearly twice as strong as other exposures per interquartile range : median FENO increased 8.7-9.9% per 0.43 nmole/min/m(3) DTT . Findings suggest that future research in oxidative stress-related illnesses such as asthma and PM exposure would benefit from assessments of PM oxidative potential and composition .	11 23 1 11122 1112 111 2 231
9496652	Hydride generator atomic absorption spectrophotometry ( HG-AAS ) is employed for the determination of arsenic in air , duplicate diet and body fluids . The detection limit for arsenic is 0.02 ppb . The reliability of the analysis is assessed through analysis of Standard Reference Materials ( SRMs ) of soil and fish tissue obtained from IAEA . The concentration of arsenic in atmospheric air particulates collected from different suburbs showed geometric means in the range of 1.9-5.6 ng/m3 . The total intake of arsenic through air and duplicate diet is approximately 10 micrograms/day for the adult population of Bombay ( Mumbai ) City . The dietary intake through food is the major contributor to the total intake . The turnover time of arsenic in blood is estimated to be approximately 33 days based on the observed mean concentration of arsenic in blood of 1 microgram/dl . The daily intake of arsenic by the adult population of Bombay is much lower than the WHO recommended value of 140 micrograms .	24 12 23 1 122 2 243
9118918	We present a validation study of a quantitative retrospective exposure assessment method used in a follow-up study of workers exposed to benzene . Assessment of exposure to benzene was carried out in 672 factories in 12 cities in China . Historical exposure data were collected for 3179 unique job titles . The basic unit for exposure assessment was a factory/work unit/job title combination over seven periods between 1949 and 1987 . A total of 18,435 exposure estimates was developed , using all available historical information , including 8477 monitoring data . Overall , 38% of the estimates were based on benzene monitoring data . The highest time-weighted average exposures were observed for the rubber industry ( 30.7 ppm ) and for rubber glue applicators ( 52.6 ppm ) . Because of its recognized link with benzene exposure , the association between a clinical diagnosis of benzene poisoning and benzene exposure was evaluated to validate the assessment method that we used in the cohort study . Our confidence in the assessment method is supported by the observation of a strong positive trend between benzene poisoning and various measures , especially recent intensity of exposure to benzene .	2 21
23906969	BACKGROUND Exposure to wildfire smoke has been associated with cardiopulmonary health impacts . Climate change will increase the severity and frequency of smoke events , suggesting a need for enhanced public health protection . Forecasts of smoke exposure can facilitate public health responses . OBJECTIVES We evaluated the utility of a wildfire smoke forecasting system ( BlueSky ) for public health protection by comparing its forecasts with observations and assessing their associations with population-level indicators of respiratory health in British Columbia , Canada . METHODS We compared BlueSky PM2.5 forecasts with PM2.5 measurements from air quality monitors , and BlueSky smoke plume forecasts with plume tracings from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hazard Mapping System remote sensing data . Daily counts of the asthma drug salbutamol sulfate dispensations and asthma-related physician visits were aggregated for each geographic local health area ( LHA ) . Daily continuous measures of PM2.5 and binary measures of smoke plume presence , either forecasted or observed , were assigned to each LHA . Poisson regression was used to estimate the association between exposure measures and health indicators . RESULTS We found modest agreement between forecasts and observations , which was improved during intense fire periods . A 30-Î¼g/m3 increase in BlueSky PM2.5 was associated with an 8% increase in salbutamol dispensations and a 5% increase in asthma-related physician visits . BlueSky plume coverage was associated with 5% and 6% increases in the two health indicators , respectively . The effects were similar for observed smoke , and generally stronger in very smoky areas . CONCLUSIONS BlueSky forecasts showed modest agreement with retrospective measures of smoke and were predictive of respiratory health indicators , suggesting they can provide useful information for public health protection .	2 231 23
23676266	BACKGROUND Many studies have reported associations between ambient particulate matter ( PM ) and adverse health effects , focused on either short-term ( acute ) or long-term ( chronic ) PM exposures . For chronic effects , the studied cohorts have rarely been representative of the population . We present a novel exposure model combining satellite aerosol optical depth and land-use data to investigate both the long- and short-term effects of PM2.5 exposures on population mortality in Massachusetts , United States , for the years 2000-2008 . METHODS All deaths were geocoded . We performed two separate analyses : a time-series analysis ( for short-term exposure ) where counts in each geographic grid cell were regressed against cell-specific short-term PM2.5 exposure , temperature , socioeconomic data , lung cancer rates ( as a surrogate for smoking ) , and a spline of time ( to control for season and trends ) . In addition , for long-term exposure , we performed a relative incidence analysis using two long-term exposure metrics : regional 10 Ã 10 km PM2.5 predictions and local deviations from the cell average based on land use within 50 m of the residence . We tested whether these predicted the proportion of deaths from PM-related causes ( cardiovascular and respiratory diseases ) . RESULTS For short-term exposure , we found that for every 10-Âµg/m increase in PM 2.5 exposure there was a 2.8% increase in PM-related mortality ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 2.0-3.5 ) . For the long-term exposure at the grid cell level , we found an odds ratio ( OR ) for every 10-Âµg/m increase in long-term PM2.5 exposure of 1.6 ( CI = 1.5-1.8 ) for particle-related diseases . Local PM2.5 had an OR of 1.4 ( CI = 1.3-1.5 ) , which was independent of and additive to the grid cell effect . CONCLUSIONS We have developed a novel PM2.5 exposure model based on remote sensing data to assess both short- and long-term human exposures . Our approach allows us to gain spatial resolution in acute effects and an assessment of long-term effects in the entire population rather than a selective sample from urban locations .	2 231 23
23896418	A variety of metals are important for biological function but have also been shown to impact health at elevated concentrations , whereas others have no known biological function . Pregnant women are a vulnerable population and measures to reduce exposure in this group are important . We undertook a study of maternal exposure to the metals , aluminium , arsenic , copper , cobalt , chromium , lithium , manganese , nickel , selenium , tin , uranium and zinc in 173 participants across Western Australia . Each participant provided a whole blood and urine sample , as well as drinking water , residential soil and dust samples and completed a questionnaire . In general the concentrations of metals in all samples were low with the notable exception of uranium ( blood U mean 0.07 Âµg/L , range &lt;0.01-0.25 Âµg/L ; urinary U mean 0.018 Âµg/g creatinine , range &lt;0.01-0.199 Âµg/g creatinine ) . Factors that influenced biological concentrations were consumption of fish which increased urinary arsenic concentrations , hobbies ( including mechanics and welding ) which increased blood manganese concentrations and iron/folic acid supplement use which was associated with decreased concentrations of aluminium and nickel in urine and manganese in blood . Environmental concentrations of aluminium , copper and lithium were found to influence biological concentrations , but this was not the case for other environmental metals concentrations . Further work is underway to explore the influence of diet on biological metals concentrations in more detail . The high concentrations of uranium require further investigation .	24 1 12 127 245 122 2 241 243 242
23683354	Volatile aromatic hydrocarbons ( VAHs : benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , mp-xylene , o-xylene , styrene , naphthalene ) in residential indoor air in Brisbane , Australia were measured in 32 houses . The total VAHs ( TVAHs ) levels ranged between 2 and 137Î¼g/m(3) and were lower than the most of the houses in the literature data . The VAHs were believed to originate from heat insulation systems , building material products as well motor vehicles but naphthalene and styrene originated from other sources . Internal garages had concentrations which are higher than the indoor air by 25-50% due to the presence of motor vehicles and may be a major source of indoor VAHs . However indoor concentrations are higher than that in the outdoor ambient air . The age of the house was found to be negatively related to VAHs concentrations in the houses with the half-life of TVAH at approximately 13years . The concentration levels of benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene and styrene are well below the guideline values set by agencies from Hong Kong , Japan , Germany and the WHO while the concentration level of naphthalene in one house exceeded the guideline value from Germany .	2 232 23
9012374	Arsenic residues in the communities surrounding former smelters remain a public health concern , especially for infants and children . To evaluate environmental exposure among these children , a population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the vicinity of a former copper smelter in Anaconda , Montana . A total of 414 children less than 72 months old were recruited . First morning voided urine samples and environmental samples were collected for arsenic measurements . The geometric mean of speciated urinary arsenic was 8.6 microg/liter ( GSD = 1.7 , N = 289 ) . Average arsenic levels of different types of soil ranged from 121 to 236 microg/g and were significantly related to proximity and wind direction to the smelter site . The same significant relationship was observed for interior dust arsenic . Speciated urinary arsenic was found to be significantly related to soil arsenic in bare areas in residential yards ( P &lt ; 0.0005 ) . In general , elevated excretion of arsenic was demonstrable and warranted parents ' attention to reduce exposure of their children to environmental arsenic .	24 245 12 242 1 2 127
9043145	Mercury concentrations were determined in scalp hair of 233 school children aged 6-16 years . The study was carried out in three communities ( Flix , Tarragona and Tortosa ) from Tarragona Province ( Southern Catalonia , Spain ) . The influence of the variables place of residence , age , sex , fish and seafood consumption , number of dental amalgam fillings , hair color , parents ' occupation , and smoking habits of the household members was also examined . The geometric mean mercury concentration in hair was 0.77 microgram/g . The place of residence , sex , and the frequency in consuming fish and seafood were the variables that significantly affected hair mercury concentrations . Girls had more mercury in their hair than boys , whereas hair mercury levels were significantly correlated with the frequency in the fish and seafood consumption , with the levels being more elevated when the fish and seafood consumption was also higher . Hair mercury concentrations were also affected by the place of residence , with school children of Flix showing lower mercury concentrations than those found in children from Tarragona and Tortosa . The remaining variables had no influence on hair mercury levels .	24 123 12 1 244 2 243
23886440	Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) have recently received attention due to their widespread contamination of the environment . PFOS and PFOA are stable in the environment and resistant to metabolism , hydrolysis , photolysis and biodegradation . PFOS and PFOA have been found in human blood and tissue samples from both occupationally exposed workers and the general worldwide population . This study aimed to determine the background levels of PFOS and PFOA in the Taiwanese population , investigate related factors , and compare exposure in Taiwan to that in other countries . The concentration of PFOS in the 59 serum samples collected from the general population in Taiwan ranged from 3.45 to 25.65ngmL(-1) ( median : 8.52 ) , and the concentration of PFOA ranged from 1.55 to 7.69ngmL(-1) ( median : 3.22 ) . There was a significant positive correlation ( r=0.51 ; p&lt;0.0001 ) between PFOS and PFOA concentrations . Males had higher concentrations of PFOA and PFOS than females . PFOS levels in serum increased with age . This study is the first investigation to reveal the PFOS and PFOA levels of serum samples in the general population of Taiwan . The levels of PFOS and PFOA in Taiwanese serum samples were comparable with those from other countries ( PFOS : 5.0-35ngmL(-1) , PFOA : 1.5-10ngmL(-1) ) .	1 122 12
8472655	A pilot study was carried out in the cell houses of three chlor alkali plants to assess level of exposure to mercury vapors among workers by air and biological monitoring . Overall airborne mercury concentrations ( mg/m3 ) were found to range from 0.05 to 0.42 ( mean , 0.21 , n = 68 ) , 0.03 to 0.16 ( mean , .08 , n = 49 ) , and 0.02 to 0.17 ( mean , 0.04 , n = 26 ) , whereas urinary mercury levels ( mg/liter ) of the exposed workers of the respective plants ranged from 0.076 to 0.592 ( mean , 0.207 , SD , 0.107 , n = 19 ) , 0.015 to 0.220 ( mean , 0.070 , SD , 0.054 , n = 16 ) , and 0.013 to 0.275 ( mean , 0.06 , SD , 0.054 , n = 23 ) . Unattended mercury spillage on the floor and improper sealing of the lids of the end boxes of electrolysis cells were found to be main factors attributing to prevalence of mercury vapors in excess of the permissible exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 . Based on the deficiencies observed , appropriate control measures have been suggested to reduce airborne mercury vapor concentrations in the work environment .	12 23 1 2 127 232
8603658	The first methylmercury poisoning by consumption of fish arose in Minamata , Japan , in 1953 . Methylmercury dispersed from Minamata to the Shiranui Sea until 1968 . Mercury concentration in the hair of residents on the coast of the Shiranui Sea was 10 to 20 times higher than that in nonpolluted people in Kumamoto Prefecture in 1960 . People on the coast of the Shiranui Sea have consumed fish containing low-dose methylmercury without a ban over decades until 1968 . We studied the effect of long-term consumption of methylmercury on those people 10 years later after the end of methylmercury dispersion . Our epidemiological study clarified that people in a fishing village ( Ooura ) on the coast of the Shiranui Sea showed a significantly higher frequency of neurological signs characteristic of methylmercury poisoning ( hypoesthesia , ataxia , impairment of hearing , visual change , and dysarthria ) in comparison with people in a nonpolluted fishing village ( Ichiburi ) . The neurological disorders were still detected 10 years later in Ooura after the end of methylmercury dispersion from Minamata ; hypoesthesia showed the highest frequency in Ooura . These results suggest that people on the coast of the Shiranui Sea were afected by long-term dietary exposure to methylmercury .	11 1 123 12 112
23873073	BACKGROUND Air pollution has been associated with respiratory health effects . There is little direct evidence that reductions in air pollution related to abatement policies lead to actual improvement in respiratory health . We assessed whether a reduction in ( traffic policy-related ) air pollution concentrations was associated with changes in respiratory health . METHODS Air pollution concentrations and respiratory health were measured in 2008 and 2010 at eight busy urban streets and at four suburban background control locations . Respiratory function was assessed twice in 661 residents by spirometry and measurements of airway resistance . Nitric oxide ( NO ) in exhaled air was measured as a marker for airway inflammation . RESULTS Air pollution concentrations were lower in 2010 than in 2008 . The declines in pollutants varied among locations , with the largest decline observed in a street with a large reduction in traffic intensity . In regression analyses adjusted for important covariates , reductions in concentrations of soot , NO2 , NOx , Cu , and Fe were associated with increases in forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ( â¼1% increase per interquartile range [ IQR ] decline ) . Airway resistance decreased with a decline in particulate matter ( PM10 ) and PM2.5 ( 9% per IQR ) , although these associations were somewhat less consistent . No associations were found with exhaled NO . Results were driven largely by one street where traffic-related air pollution showed the largest reduction . Forced expiratory volume and FVC improved by 3% to 6% in residents of this street compared with suburban background residents . This was accompanied by a suggestive reduction in airway resistance . CONCLUSIONS Reductions in air pollution may lead to small improvements in respiratory function .	11 23 1 11122 1112 111 112 2 231
8472658	A factory survey on dose-response relationship in toluene toxicity was conducted in 1985-1989 in four cities in China . The examination items consisted of personal diffusive sampling for TWA exposure measurement , questionnaires on subjective symptoms , hematology and serum biochemistry , and clinical examination including simple neurology tests . Hippuric acid was also determined in urine samples collected at the end of the shift . With selection criteria that ( 1 ) complete results were available on all study items and ( 2 ) valid toluene exposure data ( i.e. , toluene shared 90% or more of the exposure ) were obtained for the exposed , 452 toluene-exposed workers ( 206 men and 246 women ; toluene exposure at 24.7 ppm as GM ) and 517 nonexposed controls ( 246 men and 271 women ) were selected . The subjective symptoms increased in close association with the intensity of exposure to toluene ; the threshold concentration appeared to exist at 100 ppm in the case of symptoms during work , and it might be at 50-100 ppm when symptoms off work were evaluated . During the work with exposure at higher concentrations , various symptoms possibly related to CNS or local effects ( e.g. , eyes , nose , and throat ) were complained , and dizziness and floating sensations were identified as typical symptoms with significant dose-response relationship . Several symptoms persisted off work , most of which were apparently related but not necessarily limited to CNS effects . Hematology and serum biochemistry were essentially negative .	11 12 23 127 1 2 111 112 233
8603654	Blood lead levels ( BPb ) and serum polychlorinated biphenyl levels ( PCB ) were obtained from 17 employees at two adjacent scrap metal dealers . One facility was located outdoors , directly on top of soil known to be contaminated with lead and PCBs , and the other was located indoors with a concrete floor . BPbs ranged from 4.0 to 39.8 microgram/dl ( mean 19.9 microgram/dl , geometric mean 17.5 microgram/dl ) and PCB levels ranged from &lt;1 to 65.3 ppb ( mean 7.5 ppb ) . There was no significant difference in either BPb or serum PCB between the two sites . BPb was significantly correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked at work , and both BPb and serum PCB were significantly related to eating lunch outside the lunchroom , suggesting hand-to-mouth contact as a source of exposure . The lack of difference in BPb between employees of the two scrap metal dealers suggests an ongoing source of lead exposure at the sites , other than the soil .	1 122 12
23873071	BACKGROUND There continues to be public concern that mercury exposure and autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) may be associated . The primary source of exposure to organic mercury in humans is to methylmercury from fish consumption . We evaluated the association between prenatal methylmercury exposure and ASD phenotype in children and adolescents in the Republic of Seychelles , where fish consumption is high . METHODS We administered the Social Communication Questionnaire to parents of a cohort of 1784 children , adolescents , and young adults . The Social Responsiveness Scale was administered to teachers of 537 cohort subjects at about 10 years of age . Prenatal exposure to methylmercury was measured in maternal hair samples collected at or near the time of birth . Multivariable regression models evaluated the relationship between prenatal methylmercury exposure and ASD phenotypic scores , adjusting for relevant covariates . RESULTS The mean prenatal methylmercury exposure for subjects in the analysis was 8.4 ppm ( standard deviation [ SD ] = 5.7 ) . The mean Social Communication Questionnaire score was 8.0 ( SD = 4.4 ) . The mean prenatal methylmercury exposure for subjects with Social Responsiveness Scale scores was 6.7 ppm ( SD = 4.4 ) and the mean Social Responsiveness Scale score was 57.6 ( SD = 26.8 ) . No consistent association between prenatal methylmercury exposure and ASD screening instrument was found , using linear and nonlinear regression analyses . CONCLUSIONS Prenatal exposure to methylmercury was not associated with ASD phenotypic behaviors in our cohort of high fish consumers . Our findings contribute to the growing literature suggesting that exposure to methylmercury does not play an important role in the development of ASD phenotypic behavior .	11 1 123 12 112
23714150	Widespread use of phenols has led to ubiquitous exposure to phenols . In experimental animals , phenols increased resorptions , reduced live litter size and fetal body weights . However , there are limited epidemiological evidences of the relationships between exposure to phenols and pregnancy outcomes . We evaluated the associations between parental urinary levels of various phenols and spontaneous abortion in a Chinese population residing in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River . A case-control study was conducted that included 70 case couples with medically unexplained spontaneous abortion and 180 control couples who did not have a history of spontaneous abortion and had at least one living child . Both parental urinary phenols were measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry including bisphenol A ( BPA ) , benzophenone-3 ( BP-3 ) , 2,3,4-trichlorophenol ( 2,3,4-TCP ) , pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) , 4-n-octylphenol ( 4-n-OP ) and 4-n-nonylphenol ( 4-n-NP ) . Compared with the low exposure group , there was an increased risk of spontaneous abortion with high paternal urinary PCP concentration [ odds ratio ( OR)=2.09 , 95% Confidence Interval ( CI ) , 1.05-4.14 ] , and maternal exposure to 4-n-OP and alkylphenol(s) also significantly increased the risk of spontaneous abortion ( OR=2.21 , 95% CI , 1.02-4.80 ; OR=2.81 , 95% CI , 1.39-5.65 , respectively ) . Our study firstly provides the evidence that paternal PCP exposure , maternal 4-n-OP and alkylphenol(s) exposure are associated with spontaneous abortion in humans .	11 1 127 12 112
23870093	INTRODUCTION Early life exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA ) , an endocrine disrupting chemical used in some food and beverage containers , receipts , and dental sealants , has been associated with anxiety and hyperactivity in animal studies . A few human studies also show prenatal and childhood BPA exposure to be associated with behavior problems in children . METHODS We measured BPA in urine from mothers during pregnancy and children at 5 years of age ( N=292 ) . Child behavior was assessed by mother and teacher report at age 7 years and direct assessment at age 9 years . RESULTS Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased internalizing problems in boys , including anxiety and depression , at age 7 . No associations were seen with prenatal BPA concentrations and behaviors in girls . Childhood urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased externalizing behaviors , including conduct problems , in girls at age 7 and increased internalizing behaviors and inattention and hyperactivity behaviors in boys and girls at age 7 . CONCLUSIONS This study adds to the existing literature showing associations of early life BPA exposure with behavior problems , including anxiety , depression , and hyperactivity in children . Additional information about timing of exposure and sex differences in effect is still needed .	11 1 12 112 127
7717362	The effects of public drinking water contamination on birth outcomes were evaluated in an area of northern New Jersey . After excluding plural births and chromosomal defects , 80,938 live births and 594 fetal deaths that occurred during the period 1985-1988 were studied . Information on birth outcome status and maternal risk factors was obtained from vital records and the New Jersey Birth Defects Registry . Monthly exposures during pregnancy were estimated for all births using tap water sample data . Odds ratios of &gt ; or = 1.50 were found for the following : total trihalomethanes with small for gestational age , central nervous system defects , oral cleft defects , and major cardiac defects ; carbon tetrachloride with term low birth weight , small for gestational age , very low birth weight , total surveillance birth defects , central nervous system defects , neural tube defects , and oral cleft defects ; trichloroethylene with central nervous system defects , neural tube defects , and oral cleft defects ; tetrachloroethylene with oral cleft defects ; total dichloroethylenes with central nervous system defects and oral cleft defects ; benzene with neural tube defects and major cardiac defects ; and 1,2-dichloroethane with major cardiac defects . Total trihalomethane levels &gt ; 100 ppb reduced birth weight among term births by 70.4 g . By itself , this study cannot resolve whether the drinking water contaminants caused the adverse birth outcomes ; therefore , these findings should be followed up utilizing available drinking water contamination databases .	11 24 1 2 241 112
8472664	The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence rates of acute and chronic neurologic symptoms among paint workers and the association of such symptoms with the severity of exposure to mixtures of solvents . Two paint manufacturing factories and 25 various kinds of spray painting factories were selected for study . Air concentrations of organic solvents were measured by personal samplers and were analyzed by gas chromatography . A total of 196 workers were given a screening neurological examination and a questionnaire on acute and chronic neurologic symptoms . A detailed personal medical history and a profile on alcohol consumption and medication were also included . The results showed that xylenes and toluene were the major solvents found in almost all the air samples with average contents of 50 and 24% on a weight basis of 73 air samples . We classified workers according to different exposure patterns and different air concentrations of breathing zones : high ( 8-hr hygienic effect , 0.25-9.86 ; median , 1.66 ) , short-term high ( hygienic effect , 0-3.38 ; median , 0.12 ) , and low ( hygienic effect , 0-0.38 ; median , 0.12 ) . All workers showed no overt neurological signs such as ataxic gait , poor coordination , or muscle weakness . After excluding those workers who consumed more than 280 g of alcohol per week ( n = 8 ) , took antihypertensive medications ( n = 4 ) , or were treated with antipsychotic agents ( n = 1 ) , we found that the severity of exposure was associated with acute symptoms of headache and chest tightness and chronic symptoms of dizziness , easy fatigability , depressed mood , and palpitation . There was no association between peripheral neurological symptoms and the severity of exposure . Workers in the high exposure group were 2.7 times more likely to develop two or more acute symptoms and 3.3 times more likely to develop three or more chronic symptoms of the central nervous system than the low exposure group . After modeling by multiple logistic regression , we concluded that exposure to a medium level of mixtures of solvents ( hygienic effect exceeding 1.66 ) may produce acute and chronic central neurological symptoms .	11 23 1 2 112 233
8472672	Sources of bias were examined in a study of neurobehavioral effects of intrauterine exposure to methyl mercury in the Faroe Islands . The cohort of 1000 children was born during a 21-month period and did not differ from Faroese births in general as regards major obstetrical parameters . However , high mercury concentrations in the cord blood was associated with increased birth weight , presumably because other constituents of marine fish may cause a prolongation of the gestation period . Thus , children with high mercury exposures were somewhat protected against low birth weight and its associated neurobehavioral risks . Less than 25% of the women indicated occasional alcohol drinking during pregnancy , thus suggesting a limited fetal exposure to this neurobehavioral risk factor . However , maternal alcohol drinking caused a decrease in mercury concentrations in cord blood , probably because of a toxicokinetic interaction between ethanol and mercury . Any alcohol-related effect on neurobehavioral development would then be associated with lower levels of mercury exposures . The effects of these confounders would tend to bias the results of the study toward the null hypothesis .	11 1 122 12 112
23850586	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are present in many consumer goods . There is evidence that PBDEs are toxic to humans , particular young children . The purpose of this study was to assess indoor dust as an exposure source for PBDEs . Concentrations of 16 PBDEs were determined in dust samples from 33 households in New Zealand , and in breast milk samples from 33 mothers living in these households . Associations between dust and breast milk PBDE concentrations were assessed , and children's PBDE intake from breast milk and dust estimated . Influences of household and demographic factors on PBDE concentrations in dust were investigated . Indoor dust concentrations ranged from 0.1ng/g for BDE17 to 2500ng/g for BDE209 . Breast milk concentrations were positively correlated ( p&lt;0.05 ) with mattress dust concentrations for BDE47 , BDE153 , BDE154 , and BDE209 and with floor dust for BDE47 , BDE183 , BDE206 , and BDE209 . The correlation for BDE209 between dust and breast milk is a novel finding . PBDE concentrations in floor dust were lower from households with new carpets . The estimated children's daily intake of PBDEs from dust and breast milk was below U.S. EPA Reference Dose values . The study shows that dust is an important human exposure source for common PBDE formulations in New Zealand .	24 12 1 2 124 243 242
23845936	Animal studies showed that the developing brain is particularly sensitive to chemical exposure . Human studies carried out in areas with high exposures have proven neurodevelopmental disorders in relation to e.g. lead and PCBs . Whether these chemicals are associated with behavioural problems in childhood at current environmental levels is not well known . Therefore , we assessed the association between prenatal exposure to lead , cadmium , PCBs , dioxin-like compounds , HCB and p,p'-DDE and behavioural problems in 7-8year old children . Prenatal exposure data were obtained from the Flemish mother-new-born cohort . Lead , cadmium , PCBs , dioxin-like compounds , HCB and p,p'-DDE were analysed in cord blood . When the child reached 7-8years , 270 mothers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire assessing their children's behavioural health . We found that doubling the prenatal lead exposure ( cord blood lead levels ) was associated with a 3.43 times higher risk for hyperactivity in both boys and girls . In addition , total difficulties were 5.08 times more likely in the highest tertile for prenatal lead exposure compared to the lowest tertile . In girls , total difficulties were 4.92 more likely when doubling cord blood p,p'-DDE , whereas no significant association was found in boys . Further , we noted in boys a 1.53 times higher risk for emotional problems when doubling cord blood cadmium , whereas no significant association was found in girls . These results indicate that the presence of environmental contaminants influences the mental health of the next generation .	11 1 122 12 112
23838041	Human exposure to bioaccessible PCBs via indoor dust is limited around the world . In the present study , the workplace dust sample from commercial office , hospital , secondary school , shopping mall , electronic factory and manufacturing plant were collected from Hong Kong for PCBs analyses . Total PCBs concentrations ranged from 46.8 to 249 ng g(-1) , with a median of 107 ng g(-1) . Manufacturing plant showed the highest concentration among all of sampling sites . PCB 77 was found as the dominant congeners . The bioaccessibility of PCBs in small intestinal juice ranging from 8.3% to 26.0% was significantly higher than that in gastric condition , ranging from 4.8% to 12.4% . In addition , significant negative correlations ( p&lt;0.05 ) were observed between KOW and bioaccessibility for all workplace dust samples . Risk assessment indicated that the averaged daily dose of dioxin-like PCBs via non-dietary intake of workplace dust , considering the bioaccessibility of PCBs , were much lower than the TDI of dioxins ( 2.3 pg WHO-TEQ kgbw(-1)d(-1) ) established by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives .	24 2 242
23776476	Bisphenol-A ( BPA ) is a potential endocrine disruptor impacting metabolic processes and increasing the risk of obesity . To determine whether urine BPA level is associated with overweight/obesity in school-age children , we examined 1,326 students in grades 4-12 from three schools ( one elementary , one middle , and one high school ) in Shanghai . More than 98% of eligible students participated . Total urine BPA concentration was measured and anthropometric measures were taken by trained research staff . Information on risk factors for childhood obesity was collected for potential confounders . Age- and gender-specific weight greater than 90(th) percentile of the underlying population was the outcome measure . After adjustment for potential confounders , a higher urine BPA level ( â¥2 Âµg/L ) , at the level corresponding to the median urine BPA level in the U.S. population , was associated with more than two-fold increased risk of having weight &gt;90(th) percentile among girls aged 9-12 ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR)â=â2.32 , 95% confidence interval : 1.15-4.65 ) . The association showed a dose-response relationship with increasing urine BPA level associated with further increased risk of overweight ( pâ=â0.006 for trend test ) . Other anthropometric measures of obesity showed similar results . The same association was not observed among boys . This gender difference of BPA effect was consistent with findings from experimental studies and previous epidemiological studies . Our study suggests that BPA could be a potential new environmental obesogen . Widespread exposure to BPA in the human population may also be contributing to the worldwide obesity epidemic .	11 1 127 12 112
23831543	There is little evidence about exposure to currently used insecticides during early life periods and adverse effects on child neuropsychological development . The aim of this study is to examine the association between residential insecticide use during pregnancy and infancy , and the development of children . Study subjects were participants in the INMA ( Environment and Childhood ) Project , a Spanish multicenter birth cohort study . Prenatal and postnatal use of indoor insecticides and other variables were obtained from personal interview during pregnancy and infancy . Mental and psychomotor development was assessed around 14months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development . The associations were analyzed by linear regression models. 54% of women used indoor insecticides at home during pregnancy and 47% postnatally. 34% of women used insecticide sprays and 33% used plug-in devices during pregnancy . During infancy , the percentage of women who used insecticide sprays decreased ( 22% ) , but the use of plug-in devices was similar to the prenatal period ( 32% ) . The use of insecticide sprays during pregnancy was associated with a decrement in psychomotor development ( Î²=-1.9 ; 95%CI : -3.4 , -0.5 ) but postnatal use did not associate with mental and psychomotor development . The negative effect was enhanced according to some modifying factors , such as being female , higher levels of prenatal exposure to PCB and mercury and belonging to the lowest social class . We found certain evidence about the adverse effect of using insecticide sprays during pregnancy on the psychomotor development of children . Some socio-demographic factors and other exposures could enhance that effect .	24 11 1 244 2 112
23777640	1,2-Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid , diisononyl ester ( DINCH ) is a complex mixture of nine carbon branched-chain isomers . It has been used in Europe since 2002 as a plasticizer to replace phthalates such as di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) and diisononyl phthalate ( DINP ) . Urinary concentrations of the oxidative metabolites of DINCH , namely cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-monocarboxy isooctyl ester ( MCOCH ) ; cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono(oxo-isononyl) ester ( MONCH ) ; and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono(hydroxy-isononyl) ester ( MHNCH ) , can potentially be used as DINCH exposure biomarkers . The concentrations of MCOCH , MONCH and MHNCH were measured by online solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in urine collected in 2000 ( n=114 ) , 2001 ( n=57 ) , 2007 ( n=23 ) , 2009 ( n=118 ) , 2011 ( n=94 ) and 2012 ( n=121 ) from convenience groups of anonymous U.S. adult volunteers with no known DINCH exposure . None of the DINCH metabolites were detected in samples collected in 2000 and 2001 . Only one sample collected in 2007 had measureable concentrations of DINCH metabolites . The detection rate for all three metabolites increased from 2007 to 2012 . The presence of oxidative metabolites of DINCH in urine suggests that these oxidative metabolites can be used as DINCH biomarkers for exposure assessment even at environmental exposure levels .	1 12 127
8202951	Biological monitoring of mercury ( Hg ) in blood , urine and hair was performed in volunteers with amalgam fillings , in subjects who consumed fish and in Hg-exposed workers . It was found that both amalgam fillings and the consumption of fish burden the organism with Hg in the same order of magnitude . The Hg concentrations in urine in the occupationally exposed group were higher by a factor of about 100 compared to the group with amalgam fillings . No pathological changes were found in the exposed workers . It seems safe to conclude that no health-related problems from Hg are to be expected from amalgam fillings .	24 12 1 244 122 123 243 127 2
23825166	Fetal exposure to the perfluoroalkyl acids , perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , has been associated with lower birth weight and lower weight and body mass index ( weight ( kg)/height ( m)(2) ) in early infancy . It is , however , unclear if exposure to prenatal PFOS and PFOA has a lasting influence on growth . We estimated the associations between the maternal plasma level of PFOS or PFOA and the children's body mass index , waist circumference , and risk of overweight at 7 years of age . A total of 1,400 women were randomly selected from the Danish National Birth Cohort among those who provided blood samples early in pregnancy and gave birth to liveborn singletons in 1996-2002 . Weight and height information at 7 years was available for 811 children . Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for analyses . Maternal PFOS and PFOA concentrations were overall inversely but nonsignificantly associated with the children's body mass index , waist circumference , and risk of overweight at 7 years of age . In conclusion , plasma levels of PFOS and PFOA in pregnant women did not seem to have any appreciable influence on their children's anthropometry at this point in childhood .	11 1 122 12 112
8016638	The objectives of this study were the determination of : ( a ) benzene ( B ) , toluene ( T ) and xylene ( X ) air pollution in three sites of the Piedmont region ( north-western Italy ) , ( b ) the relationship between BTX pollution in indoor , outdoor and personal air measured for a group of non-smoking university students , ( c ) the influence of environmental tobacco smoke on the level of BTX exposure for indoor air environments . Results indicate ( i ) a direct relationship between human density and level of contamination and higher toluene pollution , ( ii ) an indoor/outdoor ratio of &gt ; 1 for all the three aromatics , ( iii ) a similar level of personal and indoor air contamination . Human exposure to BTX air pollution has been found to depend principally on indoor air contamination , not only on home pollution , but also , probably on many other confined environments .	2 233 232 23
23792557	BACKGROUND In vitro and rodent studies have shown that arsenic ( As ) exposure can deplete glutathione ( GSH ) and induce oxidative stress . GSH is the primary intracellular antioxidant ; it donates an electron to reactive oxygen species , thus producing glutathione disulfide ( GSSG ) . Cysteine ( Cys ) and cystine ( CySS ) are the predominant thiol/disulfide redox couple found in human plasma . Arsenic , GSH , and Cys are linked in several ways : a ) GSH is synthesized via the transsulfuration pathway , and Cys is the rate-limiting substrate ; b ) intermediates of the methionine cycle regulate both the transsulfuration pathway and As methylation ; c ) GSH serves as the electron donor for reduction of arsenate to arsenite ; and d ) As has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and therefore binds to GSH and Cys . OBJECTIVES We tested the hypothesis that As exposure is associated with decreases in GSH and Cys and increases in GSSG and CySS ( i.e. , a more oxidized environment ) . METHODS For this cross-sectional study , the Folate and Oxidative Stress Study , we recruited a total of 378 participants from each of five water As concentration categories : &lt ; 10 ( n = 76 ) , 10-100 ( n = 104 ) , 101-200 ( n = 86 ) , 201-300 ( n = 67 ) , and &gt ; 300 Âµg/L ( n = 45 ) . Concentrations of GSH , GSSG , Cys , and CySS were measured using HPLC . RESULTS An interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in water As was negatively associated with blood GSH ( mean change , -25.4 Âµmol/L ; 95% CI : -45.3 , -5.31 ) and plasma CySS ( mean change , -3.00 Âµmol/L ; 95% CI : -4.61 , -1.40 ) . We observed similar associations with urine and blood As . There were no significant associations between As exposure and blood GSSG or plasma Cys . CONCLUSIONS The observed associations are consistent with the hypothesis that As may influence concentrations of GSH and other nonprotein sulfhydryls through binding and irreversible loss in bile and/or possibly in urine .	24 11 12 122 1 11122 11123 241 1114 127 2 111 1112
8162883	Renal function has been examined in a group of 77 subjects occupationally exposed to cadmium fume and dust , together with a referent group of 103 age- and socioeconomically matched subjects . Fourteen biochemical parameters were measured on each subject . Three different ways of combining the information from all 14 tests were used to identify those subjects with renal dysfunction . These were first to count the number of parameters in which a subject recorded an abnormal test result . Second , the z value was computed for each parameter for each person by comparison with the mean and standard deviation of a derived normal population ; these z scores were then summed . Lastly a multivariate distance measure , Mahalanobis D2 , was determined for each subject from the distribution of normal subjects . The three approaches showed a considerable degree of agreement in identifying subjects with renal dysfunction , but they also displayed complementary strengths and weaknesses . The consensus of the three techniques was then taken to define truly dysfunctional subjects and each of the 14 parameters , and some combinations of pairs of parameters were tested as to their sensitivity and specificity . For this group of subjects , it was not possible to improve greatly on the use of retinol binding protein on its own . Were a second parameter to be chosen , it would be desirable to choose one reflecting the glomerular filtration rate , but the absence of a suitable sensitive biological monitoring parameter precludes a firm recommendation .	11 1 11123 111 1112
23799061	BACKGROUND Few studies in the world have assessed the incidence of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) with soil heavy metal concentrations . We explored the association of soil heavy metal factors and the MS incidence in Taiwan . METHODS There were 1240 new MS cases from the National Health Insurance Research Database and were verified with serious disabling disease certificates , 1997-2008 . Soil heavy metal factors records included arsenic , mercury , cadmium , chromium , copper , nickel , lead and zinc in Taiwan from 1986 to 2002 . Spatial regression was used to reveal the association of soil heavy metals and age- and gender-standardized incidence ratios for townships by controlling sunlight exposure hours , smoking prevalence and spatial autocorrelation . RESULTS The lead ( Pb ) concentration in the soil positively correlated with the township incidence ; on the other hand , the arsenic ( As ) concentration in soil negatively correlated with the township incidence and when found together controlled each other . The positive correlation of lead ( Pb ) predominated in males , whereas the negative correlation of arsenic ( As ) in soil predominated in females . CONCLUSIONS We conclude that exposure to lead ( Pb ) in soil positive associated with incidence of MS in Taiwan , especially in males . Exposure to arsenic ( As ) in soil negative associated with MS in Taiwan , especially in females .	245 24 2
23811414	BACKGROUND Very high levels of prenatal maternal mercury have adverse effects on the developing fetal brain . It has been suggested that all possible sources of mercury should be avoided . However , although seafood is a known source of mercury , little is known about other dietary components that contribute to the overall levels of blood mercury . OBJECTIVE Our goal was to quantify the contribution of components of maternal diet to prenatal blood mercury level . METHODS Whole blood samples and information on diet and sociodemographic factors were collected from pregnant women ( n = 4,484 ) enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( ALSPAC ) . The blood samples were assayed for total mercury using inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry . Linear regression was used to estimate the relative contributions of 103 dietary variables and 6 sociodemographic characteristics to whole blood total mercury levels ( TBM ; untransformed and log-transformed ) based on R2 values . RESULTS We estimated that maternal diet accounted for 19.8% of the total variation in ln-TBM , with 44% of diet-associated variability ( 8.75% of the total variation ) associated with seafood consumption ( white fish , oily fish , and shellfish ) . Other dietary components positively associated with TBM included wine and herbal teas , and components with significant negative associations included white bread , meat pies or pasties , and french fries . CONCLUSIONS Although seafood is a source of dietary mercury , seafood appeared to explain a relatively small proportion of the variation in TBM in our UK study population . Our findings require confirmation , but suggest that limiting seafood intake during pregnancy may have a limited impact on prenatal blood mercury levels .	24 12 1 122 2 243
7516623	In a group of 43 smelter workers exposed to inorganic arsenic dust for 13-45 years , nerve conduction velocities ( NCVs ) were significantly lower in two peripheral nerves as compared with matching referents . With multivariate data analysis , a significant negative correlation was found between cumulative absorption of arsenic and NCV in four examined nerves and the sural amplitude . Clinical symptoms of neuropathy and other symptoms related to arsenic exposure were moderate , though the difference between the groups was significant . The mean total absorption of arsenic was calculated to be less than 5 g , and the maximal absorption about 20 g . These data indicate that the adverse effect of arsenic on the peripheral nerves is dependent on long-term exposure rather than on short-term fluctuations in exposure levels .	11 1 112
8191275	This paper investigates the hypothesis that mercury from silver dental fillings ( amalgam ) may be related to multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . It compares blood findings between MS subjects who had their amalgams removed to MS subjects with amalgams . MS subjects with amalgams were found to have significantly lower levels of red blood cells , hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to MS subjects with amalgam removal . Thyroxine levels were also significantly lower in the MS amalgam group and they had significantly lower levels of total T Lymphocytes and T-8 ( CD8 ) suppressor cells . The MS amalgam group had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen and lower serum IgG . Hair mercury was significantly higher in the MS subjects compared to the non-MS control group . A health questionnaire found that MS subjects with amalgams had significantly more ( 33.7% ) exacerbations during the past 12 months compared to the MS volunteers with amalgam removal . The paper also examines epidemiological correlations between dental caries and MS ; as well as how mercury could be causing the pathological and physiological changes found in multiple sclerosis .	11 24 12 1113 1 244 11122 123 111 11123 2 1112
8328001	The dose-response relationship for environmental cadmium exposure was assessed using logistic regression analysis . The prevalence of metallothioneinuria was employed as a response variable , while age and total cadmium intake , calculated from the average cadmium concentration in rice and duration of residence in the cadmium-polluted area , were used as explanatory variables . The target population comprised of 1843 cadmium-exposed and 240 non-exposed inhabitants of Ishikawa , Japan . The individuals were divided into 96 subgroups by sex , age ( 4 categories ) , cadmium concentrations in rice ( 3 categories ) and length of residence in the polluted area ( 4 categories ) . Only total cadmium intake had a significant association with the prevalence of metallothioneinuria . In the non-exposed subjects total cadmium intakes corresponding to 2.5% prevalence of metallothioneinuria were calculated . Based on metallothionein levels expressed as either microgram/l urine or microgram/g creatinine , the total intakes were : 2.221 or 2.207 g in men and 2.365 or 0.319 g in women , respectively . Most of these values were similar to those reported by us previously , employing simple regression analysis . It is concluded , therefore , that a maximum allowable intake of about 2 g cadmium is a reasonable estimate for preventing the cadmium-induced renal dysfunction .	24 11123 1 2 111 243 11 1112
9719671	As methylmercury is excreted in human milk and infants are particularly susceptible to toxicity due to this compound , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible transfer of methylmercury to infants via breast-feeding . In a community with a high intake of seafood , 583 children from a birth cohort were followed . The duration of nursing was recorded , and hair samples were obtained for mercury analysis at approximately 12 months of age . The hair mercury concentrations increased with the length of the nursing period , and those nursed throughout the first year showed the highest geometric mean ( 9.0 nmol/g or 1.8 microg/g ) . Human milk therefore seems to be an important source of methylmercury exposure in infants . An increasing time interval from weaning to hair sample collection was not associated with any detectable decrease in mercury concentrations . A slow or absent elimination of methylmercury during the first year after birth could explain this finding . In certain fishing communities , infants nursed for long periods may be at increased risk of developing methylmercury toxicity .	1 123 12
8212053	The dose-response relationship between total cadmium intake and beta 2-microglobulinuria was investigated using logistic regression analysis in order to consider the effect of age on this association . The target population consisted of 1850 inhabitants of the cadmium-polluted Kakehashi River basin in Ishikawa prefecture , Japan . They were divided into 58 subgroups ( 27 in the men and 31 in the women ) by four factors of sex , age , rice cadmium concentration and length of residence in cadmium-polluted areas . Logistic regression analysis was performed for this dose-response relationship , and both age and total cadmium intake were significantly associated with beta 2-microglobulinuria . It was confirmed that total cadmium intake had a significant association with beta 2-microglobulinuria , independent of the aging effect .	24 11 1 2 111 11123 1112
8235573	The influence of dental amalgam fillings and fish eating frequency on the urinary mercury ( Hg ) level was evaluated in 1642 children ( ages : 3-18 ) living in Tokyo . Geometric mean of the urinary Hg level was 1.9 microgram Hg/l and 1.9 micrograms Hg/g creatinine ( Cr ) for boys and 2.1 micrograms Hg/l and 2.0 micrograms Hg/g Cr for girls . Multiple regression analysis was conducted using : ( 1 ) urinary Cr concentration ( only in the case of urinary Hg expressed as microgram Hg/l ) ; ( 2 ) age ; ( 3 ) gender ; ( 4 ) number of dental amalgam fillings ; and ( 5 ) fish eating frequency as independent variables . As a result , all the variables examined were significant and the explanatory powers ( square of multiple correlation coefficient ) of these variables were 17 or 7% for urinary Hg expressed as microgram Hg/l or microgram Hg/g Cr , respectively . Number of dental amalgam fillings or fish eating frequency explained only up to 1.5% of the total variance of urinary Hg . Contribution of Cr concentration , age and gender to urinary Hg level is also discussed .	24 12 1 244 2 243 127
22959488	BACKGROUND Epidemiological evidence suggests a negative impact of methylmercury ( MeHg ) on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) . This issue is of concern in Arctic populations such as in the Inuit of Nunavik since this contaminant is accumulated in fish and marine mammals , which still represent the subsistence diet of this population . OBJECTIVE We examined the associations between MeHg and BP and resting HR among Inuit adults . METHODS The " SantÃ© Quebec " health survey was conducted in 1992 in the 14 villages of Nunavik and a complete set of data was obtained for 313 Inuit adultsâ¥18 years . Blood samples were collected in order to determine total mercury , lead , total polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) , fasting glucose and lipid profile while socio-demographic variables were obtained through questionnaires . Anthropometric measurements as well as BP and resting HR were obtained using standardised protocols . Pulse pressure ( PP : systolic BP minus diastolic BP ) was also calculated . Multiple linear regression was used in order to determine the change in the dependent variables associated with the quartiles of MeHg concentration , taking the quartile 1 as reference . RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 38Â±14 years and the sample was composed of 132 men ( 42.2% ) and 181 women ( 57.8% ) . MeHg geometric mean was 15.4 Î¼g/L ( 95%CI : 13.9-17.0 ) and levels ranged from 0.8 to 112.0 Î¼g/L . Resting HR increased linearly across quartiles of blood MeHg concentration after adjusting for confounders ( p for trend=0.02 ) . An increase of 6.9 beats per minute ( bpm ) between the 4th and 1st quartile was observed after adjusting for confounders . No significant association was observed between blood MeHg and systolic BP , diastolic BP or PP . CONCLUSIONS MeHg was associated with increasing resting HR after considering traditional risk factors as well as other contaminants ( lead and total PCBs ) and n-3 PUFAs . In contrast , no significant association with blood pressure was observed in this study .	11 1 122 12 112
11445515	An association between in utero polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) exposure and impaired childhood intellectual functioning has been reported , but the potential impact of PCB exposure during adulthood on intellectual functioning has received little attention . We assessed the impact of PCBs and other fish-borne contaminants on intellectual functioning in older adults . The subjects were 49- to 86-year-old Michigan residents recruited from an existing cohort . Fish eaters ate &gt ; 24 lb of sport-caught Lake Michigan fish per year and non-fish eaters ate &lt ; 6 lb of Lake Michigan fish per year . A battery of cognitive tests including tests of memory and learning , executive function , and visual-spatial function was administered to 180 subjects ( 101 fish eaters and 79 non-fish eaters ) . Blood samples were analyzed for PCBs and 10 other contaminants . We evaluated cognitive outcomes using multiple regression . PCBs and dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene ( DDE ) were markedly elevated in fish eaters . After controlling for potential confounders PCB , but not DDE , exposure was associated with lower scores on several measures of memory and learning . These included the Weschler Memory Scale verbal delayed recall ( p = 0.001 ) , the semantic cluster ratio ( p = 0.006 ) , and list A , trial 1 ( p = 0.037 ) , from the California Verbal Learning Test . In contrast , executive and visual-spatial function were not impaired by exposure to either PCBs or DDE . In conclusion , PCB exposure during adulthood was associated with impairments in memory and learning , whereas executive and visual-spatial function were unaffected . These results are consistent with previous research showing an association between in utero PCB exposure and impairments of memory during infancy and childhood .	11 24 12 1 122 2 243 112
11445518	We studied a group of women of reproductive age ( 15-49 years ) who were chronically exposed to arsenic through drinking water to identify the pregnancy outcomes in terms of live birth , stillbirth , spontaneous abortion , and preterm birth . We compared pregnancy outcomes of exposed respondents with pregnancy outcomes of women of reproductive age ( 15-49 years ) who were not exposed to arsenic-contaminated water . In a cross-sectional study , we matched the women in both exposed and nonexposed groups for age , socioeconomic status , education , and age at marriage . The total sample size was 192 , with 96 women in each group ( i.e. , exposed and nonexposed ) . Of the respondents in the exposed group , 98% had been drinking water containing [ Greater and equal to ] 0.10 mg/L arsenic and 43.8% had been drinking arsenic-contaminated water for 5-10 years . Skin manifestation due to chronic arsenic exposure was present in 22.9% of the respondents . Adverse pregnancy outcomes in terms of spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , and preterm birth rates were significantly higher in the exposed group than those in the nonexposed group ( p = 0.008 , p = 0.046 , and p = 0.018 , respectively ) .	11 24 1 2 241 112
22968348	Cooking oil fumes ( COF ) contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , heterocyclic aromatic amines , benzene , and formaldehyde , which may cause oxidative damages to DNA and lipids . We assessed the relations between exposure to COF and subsequent oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation among military cooks and office-based soldiers . The study population , including 61 Taiwanese male military cooks and a reference group of 37 office soldiers , collected urine samples pre-shift of the first weekday and post-shift of the fifth workday . We measured airborne particulate PAHs in military kitchens and offices and concentrations of urinary 1-OHP , a biomarker of PAH exposure , urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , a biomarkers of oxidative DNA damage , and urinary isoprostane ( Isop ) . Airborne particulate PAHs levels in kitchens significantly exceeded those in office areas . The concentrations of urinary 1-OHP among military cooks increased significantly after 5 days of exposure to COF . Using generalized estimating equation analysis adjusting for confounding , a change in log(8-OHdG) and log(Isop) were statistically significantly related to a unit change in log(1-OHP) ( regression coefficient ( Î² ) , Î²=0.06 , 95% CI 0.001-0.12 ) and ( Î²=0.07 , 95% CI 0.001-0.13 ) , respectively . Exposure to PAHs , or other compounds in cooking oil fumes , may cause both oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation .	11 1 12 23 1111 11121 11122 2 111 1114 127 1112 232
17215020	In the present investigation , eleven human adipose tissue samples , two seal blubber samples and two pelican muscles samples were analyzed with regard to their concentrations of PCB parent compounds as well as to the respective chiral methylsulfonyl metabolites 3-MeSO2-CB 91 , 4-MeSO2-CB 91 , 3-MeSO2-CB 95 , 4-MeSO2-CB 95 , 3-MeSO2-CB 149 , 4-MeSO2-CB 149 , 3-MeSO2-CB 132 , 4-MeSO2-CB 132 , 3-MeSO2-CB 174 , and 4-MeSO2-CB 174 and the achiral metabolites 3-MeSO2-CB 49 , 4-MeSO2-CB 49 , 3-MeSO2-CB 101 , 4-MeSO2-CB 101 , 3-MeSO2-CB 110 , 4-MeSO2-CB 110 and 3-MeSO2-DDE . In order to verify enantioselective transformation processes and to compare the different enzymatic transformation pathways in birds and mammals , the enantioselective excesses of the chiral PCB-metabolites were determined by enantioselective gas chromatography with electron capture and mass spectrometric detection using modified cyclodextrin phases , including heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-)-beta-cyclodextrin/OV1701 ( 1:1 ) for the parent PCBs and heptakis(2,3-di-O-methyl-6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-)-beta-cyclodextrin/SE52 ( 1:4 ) for the metabolites , respectively .	1 121 12
11514106	In 1999 , a campaign of the Flemish Ministry of Health , Belgium was set up to assess pollutant concentrations and related health effect biomarkers in humans living in two regions of Flanders . The study was called the ' Flemish Environment and Health Study ' ( FLEHS ) . Concentrations of selected organochiorine pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDD ) and flirans ( PCDF ) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 47 pooled human serum samples originating from 200 individual women between 50 and 65 years living in two Flemish regions . The CALUX ( Chemical-Activated Luciferase gene eXpression ) bioassay was assessed on the same pools . The correlation between CALUX-TEQ and total TEQ ( sum of PCDD/PCDF , non- and mono-ortho PCBs ) varied from 0.43 to 0.73 for the rural and urban region , respectively . The mean value for the total TBQ ( 75 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ) was two times higher than the mean TEQ value determined with the CALUX bioassay ( 36 pg TEQ/g fat ) . This shows that the assessment of dioxin-like exposure by these two measurements was different . However , regional differences in concentrations were observed for neither total TEQs , nor CALUX-TEQs . It was concluded that the CALUX can be an alternative screening tool for biomonitoring purposes , especially when the objective is to compare different groups of people ( e.g. living in different regions ) .	1 122 12
22999706	In order to assess mercury ( Hg ) , selenium ( Se ) and arsenic ( As ) exposure in the Mediterranean area , total mercury ( THg ) , monomethylmercury ( MeHg ) , Se and As levels were measured in umbilical cord blood and breast milk from Italian ( n=900 ) , Slovenian ( n=584 ) , Croatian ( n=234 ) and Greek ( n=484 ) women . THg , MeHg , As , and Se levels were also determined in blood samples of the same mothers from Italy and Croatia . In addition , THg and MeHg were determined in the same women's hair from all the countries involved in this study and As and Se levels were determined in the mother's urine samples from Italy , Croatia and Greece . Besides recording the consumption of other food items , the frequencies of fish consumption were assessed by detailed food frequency questionnaires , since fish represents an important source of Hg , Se and As in humans . The highest levels of THg and As were found in cord blood ( Med((THg))=5.8 ng/g ; Med((As))=3.3 ng/g ) and breast milk ( Med((THg))=0.6 ng/g ; Med((As))=0.8 ng/g ) from Greek women , while the highest Se levels were found in cord blood ( Med=113 ng/g ) from Italy . Significant linear correlations were found between Hg , Se and As in blood , cord blood and breast milk . In addition , significant relations were found between the frequencies of total fish consumption and biomarkers of As , MeHg and Se exposure , with the strongest Spearman rank coefficients between frequencies of total fish consumption and THg levels in cord blood ( r(s)=0.442 , p&lt;0.001 ) or THg levels in hair ( r(s)=0.421 , p&lt;0.001 ) , and between frequencies of total fish consumption and As levels in cord blood ( r(s)=0.350 , p&lt;0.001 ) . The differences in Hg and As exposure between countries were probably due to different amounts of fish consumption and the consumption of different species of fish of different origin , while the highest Se levels in women from Italy were probably the consequence of the more frequent consumption of different non specific food items . Moreover , fish consumption , the possible common source of As , Hg and Se intake , could explain the correlations between the elements determined in cord blood , mother's blood or breast milk .	24 12 1 122 123 124 243 127 2
11544170	We tested the hypothesis that exposure of healthy volunteers to concentrated ambient air particles ( CAPS ) between 0.1 and 2.5 microm in diameter is associated with modulation of human alveolar macrophage ( AM ) function , cytokine production , and immune phenotype in both blood and lung . Thirty-eight volunteers were exposed to either filtered air or CAPS from the immediate environment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency human studies facility in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , USA . Particle concentrations in the chamber during the exposures ranged from 23.1 to 311.1 microg/m3 . No symptoms were noted by volunteers after the exposure . Eighteen hours after exposure , analysis of cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) showed a mild increase in neutrophils in both the bronchial ( 8.4 +/- 2% ) and alveolar fractions ( 4.2 +/- 1.7% ) in subjects exposed to the highest concentration of CAPS compared to neutrophils in the fluids of those exposed to filtered air ( bronchial fraction 2.7 +/- 0.6% ; alveolar fraction 0.8 +/- 0.3% ) . There was no change in the percentage of lymphocytes or AMs recovered in the lavage after inhalation of the highest particle levels ( mean 207 microg/m3 ) . There was also no change in the proportion of lymphocytes in the BAL expressing CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD19 , nor activation markers CD25 or CD69 . Particle inhalation did not affect the expression of CD11b , CD64 , CD16 , CD14 , CD71 on AM , nor was there an effect on phagocytosis or oxidant generation following stimulation with zymosan A. IL-6 and IL-8 levels detected by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay in the BAL were unrelated to inhaled particle levels . The distribution of lymphocyte subsets in blood obtained 18 hr after exposure to CAPS did not differ from that found before exposure . We conclude that ambient air particles are capable of inducing a mild inflammation in the lower respiratory tract but have no effect on immune phenotype or macrophage function under the conditions tested .	11 23 1 1113 11123 111 2 1112
23291477	The present study evaluated 168 childcare facilities from 6 cities in South Korea to assess exposure to organophosphorus pesticides ( OPs ) in children through 4 major pathways ( indoor air , indoor dust , surface wipe of indoor objects , and hand wash water of children ) . The Excess Cancer Risk ( ECR ) was calculated based on the Cancer Potency Factor ( CPF ) and Age Dependent Adjustment Factor ( ADAF ) in adults . Dichlorvos residues were detected in the indoor air , indoor dust , surface wipes of indoor objects , and the hand wash water of children at frequencies of 47.4 , 90 , 100 , and 100% , respectively . After revision based on the ADAF , total cancer risk in the 50th percentile was 3.99Ã10(-3) for inhalation , oral intake , and dermal contact in children ages 3 to 4 and 4.63Ã10(-4) in kindergarteners ages 5 to 6 . Inhalation was the primary pathway of pesticide exposure in children in childcare facilities . Children ages 3 to 4 in daycare centers had a Hazard Quotient ( HQ ) of 0.5 for dichlorvos , which was 50% lower than the risk criterion level of 1 but was higher than the 95% percentile with a HQ of 1.9 . This study postulates that children in childcare facilities may be exposed to specific OPs .	24 22 23 244 2 242 232
22999890	Due to the increased awareness of the ubiquitous contamination of all environmental compartments and of human beings with perfluoroalkyl substances ( PFAS ) , voluntary withdrawals and shifts in products and manufacturing technologies , as well as in regulatory measures , have been made . To investigate whether these activities are reflected in the human exposure to PFASS , we examined human blood archived by the German Environmental Specimen Bank . Plasma samples ( n=258 , age range 20-29 years ) covering the observation period 1982-2010 were analyzed for eleven perfluoroalkylcarboxylates ( C4-C14 ) and five perfluoroalkylsulfonates ( C4-C10 ) by HPLC-MS-MS . We detected perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , and perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) most often of all PFASs . Following a sharp increase from 1982 to 1986 , median PFOS concentrations remained in the range of 20-24ng/mL until the end of the 1990s . Between 2001 and 2010 , PFOS concentrations decreased steadily to 4ng/mL in plasma . Except for a similar strong increase from 1982 to 1986 , we observed PFOA concentrations fluctuating between 4.8 and 6.3ng/mL in the following years . Since 2008 , ESB data suggest a decreasing trend of PFOA . PFHxS concentrations increased continuously between 1982 and 2001 from about 1-2ng/mL . After nearly unchanged concentrations until 2005 , a downward trend of PFHxS in plasma became apparent and in 2010 resulted in levels which were about 20% lower than those observed in the early 1980s . In the case of shorter and longer chained PFASs , quantification frequencies were between 0 and 60% and we found no indication of any temporal trends in human plasma concentrations .	1 122 12
23272997	Perfluoroalkyl substances are manmade chemicals used in many consumer products and have become ubiquitous in the environment . Animal studies and a limited number of human studies have demonstrated developmental effects in offspring exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances in utero , but the implications of timing of in utero exposure have not been systematically investigated . The present study investigated variation in perfluorocarbon levels of 9952 women of childbearing age who had been exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) in drinking water contaminated by industrial waste . An analysis of variance with contrast was performed to compare the levels of PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ( PFOS ) in pregnant and nonpregnant women overall and during each trimester of pregnancy . We found that pregnant women had lower circulating PFOA and PFOS concentrations in peripheral blood than nonpregnant women and that PFOA levels were consistently lower throughout all trimesters for pregnancy , suggesting transfer to the fetus at an early stage of gestation . These results are discussed in the context of the endocrine-disrupting properties of perfluoroalkyl substances that have been characterized in animal and human studies . Our conclusion is that further , systematic study of the potential implications of intrauterine perfluorocarbon exposure during critical periods of fetal development is urgently needed .	24 12 1 122 2 241
23010224	Concentrations of 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and 12 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dl-PCBs ) were measured in 96 food composite samples from eight varieties of food groups from the Chinese total diet study ( TDS ) in 2007 . The concentrations of samples , expressed as WHO toxic equivalents ( TEQ ) , ranged from 0.001 pg TEQ g(-1) to 0.85 pg TEQ g(-1) ( fresh weight ) . Dietary intake of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs of 12 age/gender subgroups of the Chinese population subsequently estimated ranges from 15.4 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw month(-1) to 38.7 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw month(-1) for average population and from 68.5 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw month(-1) to 226.1 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw month(-1) for high consumers ( the 97.5th percentile ) . Dietary exposure of children ( mean : 32.5 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw month(-1) ) is significantly higher than that of the adults ( mean : 21.5 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw month(-1) ) ( p&lt;0.01 ) presumably due to more food consumed by children relative to their body weight compared to adults . There is no difference of dietary exposure , expressed as pg TEQ kg(-1) bw , found between different genders . Across various regions in China , there are large differences of dietary exposure of adult population and pattern of contribution of food groups to total exposure due to different contamination level and food habits . Dietary exposures of average population of various subgroups were all below the PTMI recommended by JECFA , but those of higher consumers were found exceeding or comparable to the PTMI .	24 2 243
23014924	Annoyance produced by air pollution has been suggested as a useful proxy for determining ambient air pollution exposure . However , most of the studies , to date , have focused on nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide , with no work done on volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) . This study is aimed at examining the associations between odour annoyance and VOC in ' Chemical Valley ' , Sarnia , Ontario , Canada . Annoyance scores were extracted from a community health survey ( N = 774 ) , and exposures to VOC were estimated from respondents ' six-digit alphanumeric postal codes using land use regression models . Univariate analyses were used to explore the relationships between odour annoyance and modelled pollutants , whilst multivariate ordinal logistic regression was utilized to examine the determinants of odour annoyance . The results indicate that odour annoyance is significantly associated with modelled benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , o-xylene and ( m + p ) xylene ( BTEX ) pollutants . The findings also show that the determinants of odour annoyance in the context of VOC include gender , number of relatives in the community , perception of air pollution , community satisfaction , medical checkups , ability to cope with daily life demands and general symptoms . When compared , the analysis indicates that Sarnia residents respond to considerably lower BTEX concentrations than the allowable ' safe ' levels in the province of Ontario . In general , the results exhibit a dose-response gradient with annoyance score increasing with rising modelled pollutant concentrations . The observed relationships suggest that odour annoyance might be a function of true exposure and may serve as a proxy for air quality and ambient air pollution monitoring . However , questionnaire-based odour annoyance scores need to be longitudinally validated across different geographical scales and pollutants if they are to be adopted at the national level .	11 23 1 2 112 231
23220757	This study evaluates the exposure level of primary school children at three different towns in northern Attica , near the banks of the Kifissos River , defining referential values of toxic heavy metals . Concentrations of five toxic metals ( arsenic , cadmium , mercury , lead and nickel ) were analyzed in water samples from the Kifissos River as well as in the scalp hair of children aged 11 to 12 years old living in the study area . Chronic low-level toxicity of lead and cadmium came into view in recent years as a problem of our civilization . Exposure to concentrations of arsenic ( As ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , mercury ( Hg ) and lead ( Pb ) poses a potential threat to humans and can cause effects on children's renal and dopaminergic systems without clear evidence of a threshold , a fact that reinforces the need to control all the potential heavy metal emissions into the environment in order to protect children's health . The results were analyzed with the IBM SPSS Statistics 20 for Windows . The possible influence of sex and area was examined . Statistical differences were observed by t-test between the log-transformed hair concentrations of lead ( p=0.021 ) , arsenic ( p=0.016 ) and nickel ( p=0.038 ) in children's scalp hair from the municipalities of Kifisia and Kryoneri . ANOVA one-way test confirmed the difference of Pb concentration in hair between girls and boys from the municipality of Kifisia ( p=0.038 ) . The t-test confirms the difference of heavy metal concentrations in river samples between the municipalities Kifisia and Philadelphia in comparison with the samples from Kryoneri . The observations suggest that children living at the municipality of Kifisia are exposed to higher concentrations of heavy metals than the others . Despite all the confounding factors , hair can be used as a biomarker in order to determine the exposure to heavy metals , according to standardized protocols .	24 123 12 1 2 241
16162313	The concentration of the metals lead , copper , zinc , cadmium and iron was determined in bone remains belonging to 30 individuals buried in the Region of Cartagena dating from different historical periods and in eight persons who had died in recent times . The metals content with respect to lead , cadmium and copper was determined either by anodic stripping voltammetry or by atomic absorption spectroscopy on the basis of the concentrations present in the bone remains . In all cases , zinc and iron were quantified by means of atomic absorption spectroscopy . The lead concentrations found in the bone remains in our city are greater than those reported in the literature for other locations . This led to the consideration of the sources of these metals in our area , both the contribution from atmospheric aerosols as well as that from the soil in the area . Correlation analysis leads us to consider the presence of the studied metals in the analysed bone samples to be the consequence of analogous inputs , namely the inhalation of atmospheric aerosols and diverse contributions in the diet . The lowest values found in the studied bone remains correspond to the Neolithic period , with similar contents to present-day samples with respect to lead , copper , cadmium and iron . As regards the evolution over time of the concentrations of the metals under study , a clear increase in these is observed between the Neolithic period and the grouping made up of the Bronze Age , Roman domination and the Byzantine period . The trend lines used to classify the samples into 7 periods show that the maximum values of lead correspond to the Roman and Byzantine periods . For copper , this peak is found in the Byzantine Period and for iron , in the Islamic Period . Zinc shows an increasing tendency over the periods under study and cadmium is the only metal whose trend lines shows a decreasing slope .	1 12 125
11641007	In rotogravure industry , contributing considerably to mass color printing of catalogues and magazines , toluene is still extensively used as paint solvent , and many printers have been exposed to this chemical for several decades . Information on adverse health effects associated with long-term toluene exposure is still controversial . In a multi-center study , adverse health effects possibly associated with long-term toluene exposure were evaluated . In 12 rotogravure factories , 1226 male volunteers were recruited , and sufficient information on exposure and on medical data was compiled for about 1077 of them . Evaluations included : physical examination , standard tests of psycho-physiological and psycho-motoric performances , self-report of subjective symptoms , and data on a variety of laboratory blood tests . The medical data were correlated with the length ( months ) of toluene exposure , and a rough estimate of the extent of exposure ( i.e. highly exposed printers and their helpers versus employees working at locations with low or negligible toluene exposure ) . A small reference group ( n=109 ) was selected from companies of the paper industry . When linear regression curves were calculated ( test results versus duration of exposure ) , extremely low overall coefficients of determination ( r(2) adj. ) of a few percent were estimated within the data clouds , with sometimes statistically significant P-values . Closer analyses revealed a strong influence of the confounding factor age , no clustering of abnormal values of highly toluene-exposed volunteers , and the vast majority or all values of the highly and long-term toluene-exposed participants staying within the reference ranges . Thus , no medical relevance of P-values &lt;0.05 could be recognized in this evaluation , and there may have been some border-line deviations or results largely occurring by chance in the large trial . In a small cluster of the many rotogravure printers toluene-exposed for more than 20 years , the highest systolic blood pressure values of the study were found , but many possible confounding factors were not taken into account . Data on acute exposure and possible effects are presented in accompanying papers ( Neubert et al. , 2001a , Neubert et al. , 2001b ) . Restricting the conclusions to the end points evaluated as well as the apparent limitations of the evaluation , no evidence was found that long-term occupational toluene exposure extending over several decades in the rotogravure industry in the Western part of Germany was convincingly associated with chronic adverse health effects or convincingly altered surrogate markers in still working male volunteers . Several peculiarities and pitfalls arising when interpreting medical data associated with such a type of environmental exposure must be considered . Reversibility of alterations previously induced at higher levels of toluene-exposure , as well as a healthy workers effect , cannot be excluded for some of the medical end points evaluated .	11 1 112
11641041	To evaluate the significance of cadmium ( Cd ) concentrations in blood ( B-Cd ) and hair ( H-Cd ) as an indicator of dose , a cross-sectional study was performed on 40 residents in a Cd-polluted area , Nagasaki Prefecture , Japan , in 1996 . In the study area , soil replacement of Cd-polluted rice fields ended in 1981 . B-Cd and H-Cd were significantly higher in the study population than in the control subjects . B-Cd was positively correlated with urinary Cd ( U-Cd ) ( Spearman r=0.50 , P=0.06 for males and r=0.72 , P=0.0001 for females ) , while H-Cd was weakly or moderately correlated with U-Cd . After adjustment for gender using logistic regression analysis , log(B-Cd) and log(U-Cd) , but not log(H-Cd) , were significantly associated with the prevalence of increased urinary beta2-microglobulin ( P for trend &lt;0.05 ) . These findings suggest that B-Cd is a good indicator of cumulative dose many years after the reduction of environmental exposure to Cd . H-Cd may be weakly or moderately correlated with body burden .	11 12 1 122 123 111 11123 127 1112
16093927	OBJECTIVES We examined the association between arsenic exposure and peripheral neuropathy in Bangladesh , where the population has been chronically exposed to arsenic in drinking water . METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study of 137 subjects derived from a larger cohort . Exposure measures included individual water arsenic concentration , cumulative arsenic index , and urinary arsenic concentration taken at two time points ( 2001 and 2003 ) . The primary outcome measurement was elevated vibrotactile threshold , as measured by a vibration sensitivity tester ( Vibratron II ) . RESULTS Arsenic exposure was associated with elevated toe vibration threshold ( TVT ) . Specifically , cumulative arsenic index and urinary arsenic ( 2001 ) were both significantly associated with elevated TVT ( P = 0.02 and P = 0.009 , respectively ) after adjustment for age and gender . CONCLUSIONS Increased arsenic exposure , as measured by both cumulative and urinary measures , was associated with evidence of subclinical sensory neuropathy .	11 24 12 127 1 2 241 112
23220138	This study aimed at investigating the presence and distribution of fluorotelomer alcohols ( FTOHs ) , perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) in house dust to evaluate human exposure to these compounds via dust ingestion. 31 house dust samples were collected from Bavaria , Germany and analyzed for 4:2 , 6:2 , 8:2 and 10:2 FTOH , PFOS and PFOA . PFOA was the dominant compound in 79% of the dust samples , followed by PFOS and 8:2 FTOH , while 4:2 FTOH was not detected in any samples . The total concentration of per- and polyfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) varied from 32.2 to 2456 ng/g . In addition , the total ingestion rate for PFCs was 0.4-135 ng/d for adults and 5.1-246 ng/d for toddlers , and the highest 8:2 FTOH-based PFOA intake via indoor dust was 0.24 ng/d for adults and 0.44 ng/d for toddlers . Overall , the results of this study demonstrate that dust ingestion is a minor pathway for human exposure to these PFCs ; the PFC ingestion via indoor dust is generally low , and only under a worst scenario high intakes have to be expected for toddlers .	24 2 242
16093295	During 1998-2000 , the authors investigated relations between lung function , respiratory symptoms , and arsenic in drinking water among 287 study participants , including 132 with arsenic-caused skin lesions , in West Bengal , India . The source population involved 7,683 participants who had been surveyed for arsenic-related skin lesions in 1995-1996 . Respiratory symptoms were increased among men with arsenic-caused skin lesions ( versus those without lesions ) , particularly " shortness of breath at night " ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.8 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.1 , 7.6 ) and " morning cough " ( OR = 2.8 , 95% CI : 1.2 , 6.6 ) in smokers and " shortness of breath ever " ( OR = 3.8 , 95% CI : 0.7 , 20.6 ) in nonsmokers . Among men with skin lesions , the average adjusted forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) was reduced by 256.2 ml ( 95% CI : 113.9 , 398.4 ; p &lt ; 0.001 ) and the average adjusted forced vital capacity ( FVC ) was reduced by 287.8 ml ( 95% CI : 134.9 , 440.8 ; p &lt ; 0.001 ) . In men , a 100-microg/liter increase in arsenic level was associated with a 45.0-ml decrease ( 95% CI : 6.2 , 83.9 ) in FEV1 ( p = 0.02 ) and a 41.4-ml decrease ( 95% CI : -0.7 , 83.5 ) in FVC ( p = 0.054 ) . Women had lower risks than men of developing skin lesions and showed little evidence of respiratory effects . In this study , consumption of arsenic-contaminated water was associated with respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function in men , especially among those with arsenic-related skin lesions .	11 24 1 2 241 112
23088855	Airborne benzene concentrations were measured in a room with controlled air exchange during surface cleaning with two petroleum-based solvents ( a paint thinner and an engine degreaser ) . The solvents were spiked with benzene to obtain target concentrations of 0.001 , 0.01 , and 0.1% by volume in the liquid . Personal samples on the worker and area samples up to 1.8m away were collected over 12 events ( n=84 samples ) designed to examine variation in exposure with solvent type , cleaning method ( rag wipe or spatula scrape ) , surface area cleaned , air exchange rate , solvent volume applied , and distance from the cleaned surface . Average task breathing zone concentrations of benzene represented by 18-32 min time-weighted averages were 0.01 ppm , 0.05 ppm , and 0.27 ppm , when the solvents contained approximately 0.003 , 0.008 , and 0.07% benzene . Solvent benzene concentration , volume applied , and distance from the handling activities had the greatest effect on airborne concentrations . The studied solvent products containing 0.07% benzene ( spiked ) did not exceed the current OSHA permissible exposure limit of 1 ppm ( averaged over 8h ) or the ACGIH Threshold Limit Value of 0.5 ppm , in any of the tested short-term exposure scenarios . These data suggest that , under these solvent use scenarios , petroleum-based solvent products produced in the United States after 1978 likely did not produce airborne benzene concentrations above those measured if the concentration was less than 0.1% benzene .	2 233 232 23
16010197	OBJECTIVE We sought to examine the impact of occupational exposure on brain cancer risk . METHODS Mailed questionnaires were used to collect information on lifetime employment history , occupational exposure to 18 chemicals , and other risk factors for 1009 incident cases of brain cancer and 5039 control subjects in Canada in 1994 to 1997 . RESULTS People exposed to asphalt and welding had respective odds ratio ( and 95% confidence interval ) of 1.29 ( 1.02-1.62 ) and 1.26 ( 0.98-1.45 ) . An increased risk of brain cancer might be associated with exposure to asbestos , benzene , mineral or lubricating oil , isopropyl oil , and wood dust and with following occupations : teaching ; protective service ; metal processing and related jobs , and metal shaping and forming ; knitting in textile processing ; construction trades ; and transport equipment operating . CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests a possible role for occupational exposure in the etiology of brain cancer .	2 21
23178840	Paired human breast milk and scalp hair samples ( n=30 ) were obtained in 2008 from primipara and multipara mothers living in two locations in the Philippines viz. , Payatas , a waste dumpsite , and Malate , a non-dumpsite . Samples were analyzed for three groups of organohalogenated compounds , such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) . PCBs were the predominantly identified compounds ( median : 70 ng/g lipid wt. ) in all the breast milk samples . In the human milk , CB-153 was the most dominant PCB congener ( 17-44% contribution to the sum PCB ) , closely followed by CB-138 ( 12-35% ) , CB-118 ( 4-12% ) , CB-180 ( 2-13% ) , CB-187 ( 3-13% ) , and CB-170 ( 1.5-10% ) . Levels of PBDEs ( median : 3.0 ng/g lipid wt. ) in human milk samples from the Philippines were similar to other Asian or European countries . BDE-47 , -99 , -100 and -153 were the major PBDE congeners . For HBCDs , the Î±-isomer was predominant followed by the Î³-HBCD isomer in the both locations . PBDE levels in human milk were significantly higher in the dumpsite ( 3.9 ng/g lipid wt. ) than in the non-dump site ( 2.2 ng/g lipid wt. ) . PBDE concentrations ( including BDE-209 ) were significantly higher ( median : 70 ng/g hair ) than those of PCBs ( median : 30 ng/g hair ) and HBCDs ( median : 1.0 ng/g hair ) in all the scalp hair samples . To our knowledge , this is the first report on HBCDs in human scalp hair . PBDE congeners in scalp hair were dominated by BDE-209 and BDE-47 . On a congener basis , the levels of PBDEs found in scalp hair were higher than those in Spain ( children and adults ) and China ( general people ) . PCB levels found in scalp hair were higher than those in Greece , Romania and Belgium , but lower than those in China . In this study , there were no significant differences in the concentration of PCBs and HBCDs in human milk ; and PCBs , HBCDs and PBDEs in human scalp hair from the two different locations . No significant correlations were observed between PCBs , PBDEs and HBCDs levels and age of mothers in this study , which may be due to the small number of samples . Furthermore , there was no correlation between milk and hair levels for more persistent compounds ( PCB-153 , PCB-138 , or BDE-47 ) , and thus it is worthy to follow-up in future studies along with more number of samples . This is the first report to provide measurement data for PCBs , PBDEs and HBCDs in paired milk and hair of populations in the Philippines .	1 123 12 124
23149275	The Near-Road Exposures and Effects of Urban Air Pollutants Study ( NEXUS ) was designed to examine the relationship between near-roadway exposures to air pollutants and respiratory outcomes in a cohort of asthmatic children who live close to major roadways in Detroit , Michigan USA . From September 2010 to December 2012 a total of 139 children with asthma , ages 6-14 , were enrolled in the study on the basis of the proximity of their home to major roadways that carried different amounts of diesel traffic . The goal of the study was to investigate the effects of traffic-associated exposures on adverse respiratory outcomes , biomolecular markers of inflammatory and oxidative stress , and how these exposures affect the frequency and severity of respiratory viral infections in a cohort of children with asthma . An integrated measurement and modeling approach was used to quantitatively estimate the contribution of traffic sources to near-roadway air pollution and evaluate predictive models for assessing the impact of near-roadway pollution on children's exposures . Two intensive field campaigns were conducted in Fall 2010 and Spring 2011 to measure a suite of air pollutants including PM2.5 mass and composition , oxides of nitrogen ( NO and NO2 ) , carbon monoxide , and black carbon indoors and outdoors of 25 participants ' homes , at two area schools , and along a spatial transect adjacent to I-96 , a major highway in Detroit . These data were used to evaluate and refine models to estimate air quality and exposures for each child on a daily basis for the health analyses . The study design and methods are described , and selected measurement results from the Fall 2010 field intensive are presented to illustrate the design and successful implementation of the study . These data provide evidence of roadway impacts and exposure variability between study participants that will be further explored for associations with the health measures .	11 23 1 2 111 1114 112 231
22901427	Epidemiological studies suggest that fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) may increase the risk for developing diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . To evaluate possible mechanisms explaining these associations , we investigated if sub-acute ambient-level exposures can impair insulin sensitivity . Twenty-five healthy adults living in rural Michigan were transported to an urban location for 5 consecutive days ( exposure-block ) of daily 4- to 5-hour-long ambient air pollution exposures . Health outcomes , including the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) the primary outcome of insulin sensitivity , were measured at 3 time points in relation to exposure-blocks : 7days prior to start ; on the last exposure-day ; and 7days after completion . PM2.5 was monitored at the urban exposure site and at community monitors near subjects ' residences . We calculated 3 " sub-acute " exposure periods ( approximately 5-days-long ) starting retrospective from the time of health outcome measurements ( PM2.5 ranges : 9.7Â±3.9 to 11.2Â±3.9Î¼gÂ·m(-3) ) . A 10Î¼gÂ·m(-3) increase in sub-acute PM2.5 exposures was associated with increased HOMA-IR ( +0.7 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 0.1 to 1.3 ; p=0.023 ) and reduced heart rate variability ( standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals [ -13.1ms , 95%CI -25.3 to -0.9 ; p=0.035] ) . No alterations in other outcomes ( inflammatory markers , vascular function ) occurred in relation to PM2.5 exposures . Our findings suggest that ambient PM2.5 , even at low levels , may reduce metabolic insulin sensitivity supporting the plausibility that air pollution could potentiate the development of DM .	11 23 1 2 111 112 231
11683589	The interrelationship of blood lead ( BPb ) , activity of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase ( ALAD ) , erythrocyte protoporphyrin ( EP ) , blood cadmium ( BCd ) , serum copper ( SCu ) , serum zinc ( SZn ) , serum selenium ( SSe ) , hematocrit ( Hct ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , age , smoking habits , and alcohol consumption to blood pressure was examined in 154 Croatian male subjects 19-53 years of age . None of the subjects had been occupationally exposed to metals , or used any medication that could influence blood pressure or metal metabolism . The median and range values were : BPb , 57 ( 25-254 ) microg/L ; ALAD , 51.9 ( 22.8-96.4 ) European units ; EP , 0.68 ( 0.38-1.68 ) micromol/L erythrocytes ; BCd , 0.83 ( 0.21-11.93 ) microg/L ; SCu , 1113 ( 763-1662 ) microg/L ; SZn , 961 ( 734-1213 ) microg/L ; SSe , 73.6 ( 44.2-106.9 ) microg/L ; systolic blood pressure , 131 ( 105-165 ) mm Hg ; and diastolic blood pressure , 94 ( 71-112 ) mm Hg . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly correlated with an increase in BMI ( P&lt;0.0005 and P&lt;0.0001 , respectively ) , EP ( P&lt;0.0002 and P&lt;0.002 , respectively ) , and BPb ( P&lt;0.005 and P&lt;0.01 , respectively ) . After adjusting for potential confounding variables by multiple regression , an increase in systolic blood pressure was significantly predictive by BMI ( P&lt;0.0005 ) and log BPb ( P&lt;0.02 ) and inversely by log BPb*SSe interaction term ( P&lt;0.007 ) , or alternatively by EP ( P&lt;0.0001 ) , BMI ( P&lt;0.001 ) , alcohol ( P&lt;0.02 ) , and Hct ( P&lt;0.05 ) . An increase in diastolic blood pressure was significantly predictive by BMI ( P&lt;10(-5) ) , log BPb ( P&lt;0.04 ) , and alcohol ( P=0.05 ) and inversely by log BPb*SSe interaction term ( P&lt;0.0007 ) , or alternatively by BMI ( P&lt;0.0001 ) , EP ( P&lt;0.002 ) , alcohol ( P&lt;0.004 ) , and Hct ( P&lt;0.04 ) and inversely by smoking ( P&lt;0.04 ) . With respect to the EP range in the study population , an increase of 27 mm Hg in systolic and 14 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure was found . The study results indicate a significant Pb-related increase in blood pressure , particularly within the low-level Pb exposure range ( BPb of 25-75 microg/L , and/or EP of 0.4-1.0 micromol/L erythrocytes ) .	11 12 1113 1 122 11123 111 112 11122 1112
15979720	In order to assess soil As contamination and potential risk for human , soil , paddy rice , vegetable and human hair samples from the areas near the industrial districts in Chenzhou , southern China were sampled and analyzed . The results showed that the anthropogenic industrial activities have caused in local agricultural soils to be contaminated with As in a range of 11.0-1217 mg/kg . The GIS-based map shows that soil contamination with As occurred on a large scale , which probably accounted for up to 30% of the total area investigated . Soil As concentration abruptly decreased with an increase in the distance from the polluting source . High As concentrations were found in the rice grain that ranged from 0.5 to 7.5 mg/kg , most of which exceed the maximal permissible limit of 1.0 mg/kg dry matter . Arsenic accumulated in significantly different levels between leafy vegetables and non-leafy vegetables . Non-leafy vegetables should be recommended in As-contaminated soils , as their edible parts were found in relatively low As level . Arsenic concentrations in 95% of the total human hair samples in the contaminated districts were above the critical value , 1.0 mg/kg , set by the World Health Organization . Arsenic could be enriched in human hair to very high levels without being affected by As containing water . The results revealed that the soils and plants grown on them are major contributors to elevate hair As in the industrial population . Therefore , the potential impact on human health of ingestion/inhalation of soil As around the industrial districts seems to be rather serious . Hence proper treatments for As contaminated soils are urgently needed to reduce the contamination .	24 1 12 245 123 243 2
24472648	There are few established causes of leukemia , the most common type of cancer in children . Studies in adults suggest a role for specific environmental agents , but little is known about any effect from exposures in pregnancy to toxics in ambient air . In our case-control study , we ascertained 69 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) and 46 cases of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) from California Cancer Registry records of children &lt;age 6 , and 19,209 controls from California birth records within 2km ( 1.3 miles ) ( ALL ) and 6km ( 3.8 miles ) ( AML ) of an air toxics monitoring station between 1990 and 2007 . Information on air toxics exposures was taken from community air monitors . We used logistic regression to estimate the risk of leukemia associated with one interquartile range increase in air toxic exposure . Risk of ALL was elevated with 3(rd) trimester exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( OR=1.16 , 95% CI 1.04 , 1.29 ) , arsenic ( OR=1.33 , 95% CI 1.02 , 1.73 ) , benzene ( OR=1.50 , 95% CI 1.08 , 2.09 ) , and three other toxics related to fuel combustion . Risk of AML was increased with 3rd trimester exposure to chloroform ( OR=1.30 , 95% CI 1.00 , 1.69 ) , benzene ( 1.75 , 95% CI 1.04 , 2.93 ) , and two other traffic-related toxics . During the child's first year , exposure to butadiene , ortho-xylene , and toluene increased risk for AML and exposure to selenium increased risk for ALL . Benzene is an established cause of leukemia in adults ; this study supports that ambient exposures to this and other chemicals in pregnancy and early life may also increase leukemia risk in children .	2 231 23
23128055	BACKGROUND Associations between cadmium ( Cd ) and kidney function have been reported even at low levels of exposure in the general population . Recently , the causality of these associations has been questioned . OBJECTIVES We examined associations between urinary Cd ( U-Cd ; a biomarker of exposure ) and urinary proteins that are used as biomarkers of kidney effects , based on repeated short-term sampling in healthy subjects . METHODS Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected on 2 separate days at six fixed times from 30 healthy nonsmoking men and women ( median age 39 years ) . We analyzed the samples ( N = 354 ) for Cd ( i.e. , U-Cd ) and two proteins used as kidney function biomarkers : urinary albumin ( U-Alb ) and alpha-1-microglobulin ( U-A1M ) . Concentrations were adjusted for creatinine concentration or for specific gravity , and excretion rates ( mass per hour ) were calculated . Possible associations were assessed within each individual participant , and mean correlations and regressions were evaluated . RESULTS We found clear positive mean associations within individuals between the excretion of U-Cd [ mean , 0.11 Âµg/g creatinine ( range , 0.01-0.52 Âµg/g creatinine) ] and both U-Alb and U-A1M . The associations were stronger for excretion rates and concentrations adjusted for specific gravity than for concentrations adjusted for creatinine . We also found significant positive associations of urinary flow with excretion of U-Cd , U-Alb , and U-A1M . CONCLUSIONS Associations between short-term changes in U-Cd and markers of kidney function within individual nonsmoking study participants are unlikely to reflect effects of Cd toxicity . A more likely explanation is that these associations result from normal variation in renal function , including changes in urinary flow , that influence the urinary excretion of both Cd and proteins in the same direction . These effects of normal variability may result in overestimation of the adverse effects of Cd on kidney function at low-level Cd exposure .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
11695630	Dioxins ( PCDD + PCDF ) and polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) are potentially hazardous compounds and have structural similarity to thyroid hormones . Our research group on " Dioxins and PCB in Human Milk " was organized in 1997 and has been active for the past three years . We collected breast milk from 80 mothers living in Tokyo , Saitama , Ishikawa and Osaka Prefecture in Japan at 5 , 30 , 150 , 300 postpartum days and measured PCDDs , PCDFs and PCBs during 1998-1999 . We added another 20 prefectures and cities during 1999-2000 . Breast milk was obtained from 415 mothers at 30 postpartum days ( breast-feeding group ) . Blood was taken from infants who were breast-fed at the age of 1 year for evaluation of thyroid and immune functions . Blood was also taken from 53 infants who were bottle-fed ( bottle-feeding group ) as a control . Serum T4 , T3 , FT4 and TSH levels in the breast-feeding ( n = 337 ) and bottle-feeding ( n = 53 ) groups were within normal ranges and were not significantly different between the two groups . Although there were a large geographic differences of dioxins and co-PCB content in breast milk , there were no differences in serum T4 , T3 , FT4 , TSH levels and no significant correlation between the mean serum levels of TSH and TEQ in breast milk . There was a significant correlation between serum TSH at 1 year of age and that from blood on dried filter paper TSH at 5 days of age . We concluded that dioxin intake from breast milk in Japanese infants did not impair thyroid function . However , long-term effects remain to be evaluated .	11 12 1 11122 11123 124 111 1112
11712593	Air samples , representing indoor environments of a kitchen in which a kerosene stove was used were collected and analysed for volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) viz. , n-hexane , benzene , heptane , toluene , p- and o-xylene and n-decane using a cryogenic preconcentration system and a gas chromatograph with a flame-ionisation detector . Simultaneous outdoor samples were also collected to determine indoor to outdoor ( I/O ) ratios for each compound . Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with ultra violet absorption detection was optimised for separation and quantification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) in air particulate matter . Concentration of total suspended particulate matter ( TSPM ) , benzene soluble organics and the PAHs in air samples collected in indoor environment of some tenements at Trombay , Mumbai where kerosene is used as cooking fuel are discussed in relation to the concentration of the same in outdoor environment in vicinity of the tenement . VOCs and PAHs results from samples collected in kitchens in Trombay are discussed in relation to indoor air pollution .	2 232 23
11712595	Indoor air quality ( IAQ ) of a restaurant has increasingly received a lot of public concerns in Hong Kong . Unfortunately , there is limited data about the IAQ of Hong Kong restaurants . In order to characterize the current IAQ of local restaurants , four restaurants in metropolitan Hong Kong including a Korean barbecue style restaurant , a Chinese hot pot restaurant , a Chinese dim sum restaurant and a Western canteen were selected for this study . The results of this study showed that the mean concentrations of CO2 at restaurants with gas stoves for food cooking in dining areas exceeded the range from 40 to 60% indoor CO2 concentrations at restaurants without gas stoves in dining areas . The average levels of PM10 and PM2.5 at the Korean barbecue style restaurant were as high as 1442 and 1167 microg/m3 , respectively . At the Korean barbecue and Chinese hot pot restaurants , the levels of PM2.5 accounted for 80-93% of their respective PM10 concentrations . The 1-h average levels of CO observed at Korean barbecue style and hot pot restaurants were 15,100 and 8000 microg/m3 , respectively . Relatively high concentrations of CO2 , CO , PM10 , PM2.5 benzene , toluene , methylene chloride and chloroform were measured in the dining areas of the Korean barbecue style and the Chinese hot pot restaurants . The operations of pan-frying food and boiling food with soup in a hot pot could generate considerable quantities of air pollutants .	2 232 23
15927178	Endocrine-disrupting chemicals ( EDCs ) have been proposed as risk factors for endometriosis . Persistent organochlorine compounds , a group of suspected EDCs , are present to some extent in almost all human adipose tissue and blood via the food chain . A few animal studies have confirmed that exposure to these compounds can increase the incidence of endometriosis . In this study , we examined the associations between endometriosis and exposure to selected organochlorine compounds , including 8 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , 10 polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , 4 coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( cPCBs ) , 36 ortho-substituted polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and 13 chlorinated pesticides or their metabolites . The participants were 139 infertile Japanese women who were examined by laparoscopy and diagnosed as either endometriosis cases ( Stages II-IV ) or controls ( Stages 0-I ) . The serum levels ( lipid adjusted ) of the targeted organochlorine compounds were in both 58 cases and 81 controls . There were very few differences in the various levels between endometriosis cases and controls . The total serum toxic equivalency ( TEQ ) value of PCDDs was significantly higher in the controls than in the cases ( P=0.02 ) . No other total TEQ values differed between cases and controls . For PCDDs , PCDFs , cPCBs , and PCBs , the multivariate odds ratio was 0.38 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.12-1.17 ] and 0.41 ( 95% CI , 0.14-1.27 ) for the third and highest quartiles , respectively , compared to the lowest quartile of total TEQ values . A weak , negative dose-response relationship was evident for total TEQs ( P for trend of 0.06 ) . The results of this study provide some evidence that serum levels of these organochlorine compounds are not associated with an increased risk of endometriosis in infertile Japanese women .	1 122 12
15833240	We studied the exposure to methyl mercury ( MeHg ) in 127 Swedish women of childbearing age with high consumption of various types of fish , using total mercury ( T-Hg ) in hair and MeHg in blood as biomarkers . Fish consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) , including detailed information about consumption of different fish species , reflecting average intake during 1 year . We also determined inorganic mercury ( I-Hg ) in blood , and selenium ( Se ) in serum . The average total fish consumption , as reported in the food frequency questionnaire , was approximately 4 times/week ( range 1.6-19 times/week ) . Fish species potentially high in MeHg , included in the Swedish dietary advisories , was consumed by 79% of the women . About 10% consumed such species more than once a week , i.e. , more than what is recommended . Other fish species potentially high in MeHg , not included in the Swedish dietary advisories , was consumed by 54% of the women . Eleven percent never consumed fish species potentially high in MeHg . T-Hg in hair ( median 0.70 mg/kg ; range 0.08-6.6 mg/kg ) was associated with MeHg in blood ( median 1.7 microg/L ; range 0.30-14 microg/L ; rs = 0.78 ; p &lt ; 0.001 ) . Hair T-Hg , blood MeHg and serum Se ( median 70 microg/L ; range 46-154 microg/L ) increased with increasing total fish consumption ( rs = 0.32 ; p &lt ; 0.001 , rs = 0.37 ; p &lt ; 0.001 and rs = 0.35 ; p = 0.002 , respectively ) . I-Hg in blood ( median 0.24 microg/L ; range 0.01-1.6 microg/L ) increased with increasing number of dental amalgam fillings . We found no statistical significant associations between the various mercury species measured and the Se concentration in serum . Hair mercury levels exceeded the levels corresponding to the EPA reference dose ( RfD ) of 0.1 microg MeHg/kg b.w. per day in 20% of the women . Thus , there seems to be no margin of safety for neurodevelopmental effects in fetus , for women with high fish consumption unless they decrease their intake of certain fish species .	24 12 1 244 122 123 243 2
23151773	BACKGROUND Evidence suggesting that persistent environmental pollutants may be reproductive toxicants underscores the need for prospective studies of couples for whom exposures are measured . OBJECTIVES We examined the relationship between selected persistent pollutants and couple fecundity as measured by time to pregnancy . METHODS A cohort of 501 couples who discontinued contraception to become pregnant was prospectively followed for 12 months of trying to conceive or until a human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test confirmed pregnancy . Couples completed daily journals on lifestyle and provided biospecimens for the quantification of 9 organochlorine pesticides , 1 polybrominated biphenyl , 10 polybrominated diphenyl ethers , 36 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and 7 perfluorochemicals ( PFCs ) in serum . Using Cox models for discrete time , we estimated fecundability odds ratios ( FORs ) and 95% CIs separately for each partner's concentrations adjusting for age , body mass index , serum cotinine , serum lipids ( except for PFCs ) , and study site ( Michigan or Texas ) ; sensitivity models were further adjusted for left truncation or time off of contraception ( â¤ 2 months ) before enrollment . RESULTS The adjusted reduction in fecundability associated with standard deviation increases in log-transformed serum concentrations ranged between 18% and 21% for PCB congeners 118 , 167 , 209 , and perfluorooctane sulfonamide in females ; and between 17% and 29% for p,pÂ´-DDE and PCB congeners 138 , 156 , 157 , 167 , 170 , 172 , and 209 in males . The strongest associations were observed for PCB 167 ( FOR 0.79 ; 95% CI : 0.64 , 0.97 ) in females and PCB 138 ( FOR = 0.71 ; 95% CI : 0.52 , 0.98 ) in males . CONCLUSIONS In this couple-based prospective cohort study with preconception enrollment and quantification of exposures in both female and male partners , we observed that a subset of persistent environmental chemicals were associated with reduced fecundity .	11 1 122 12 112
24380822	In the Flemish human biomonitoring programme FLEHS II ( 2007-2011 ) trace metals ( Cd , Pb , Cr , Ni , Cu , Mn , Tl , Sb , As and toxic relevant arsenic ) were analysed in the blood and urine of adolescents ( 14-15 years old ) in the reference population in Flanders and in areas of important industrial activities : Genk-Zuid and Menen . After adjustment of the results for confounding factors , the adolescents living in Genk-Zuid had higher levels of Cr , Cu and Tl in blood , higher levels of Cd and toxic relevant arsenic ( TRA ) in urine , but lower levels of Ni in blood and Sb in urine compared to the reference population . In Menen higher levels of Cd and Cu in urine , higher concentrations of Tl in blood but lower concentrations of Pb in blood and lower Ni , Sb and As in urine were found compared to the reference population . For both the reference population and the hot spots the concentrations are within the ranges found in other countries . Compared to the previous biomonitoring programme FLEHS I ( 2002-2006 ) a decrease in the concentrations of Cd and especially of Pb in blood was observed . However , it cannot be excluded that differences between the two campaigns are partially due to different sampling strategies .	1 122 12 127
23154064	BACKGROUND California children's exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants ( PBDEs ) are among the highest worldwide . PBDEs are known endocrine disruptors and neurotoxicants in animals . OBJECTIVE Here we investigate the relation of in utero and child PBDE exposure to neurobehavioral development among participants in CHAMACOS ( Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas ) , a California birth cohort . METHODS We measured PBDEs in maternal prenatal and child serum samples and examined the association of PBDE concentrations with children's attention , motor functioning , and cognition at 5 ( n = 310 ) and 7 years of age ( n = 323 ) . RESULTS Maternal prenatal PBDE concentrations were associated with impaired attention as measured by a continuous performance task at 5 years and maternal report at 5 and 7 years of age , with poorer fine motor coordination-particularly in the nondominant-at both age points , and with decrements in Verbal and Full-Scale IQ at 7 years . PBDE concentrations in children 7 years of age were significantly or marginally associated with concurrent teacher reports of attention problems and decrements in Processing Speed , Perceptual Reasoning , Verbal Comprehension , and Full-Scale IQ . These associations were not altered by adjustment for birth weight , gestational age , or maternal thyroid hormone levels . CONCLUSIONS Both prenatal and childhood PBDE exposures were associated with poorer attention , fine motor coordination , and cognition in the CHAMACOS cohort of school-age children . This study , the largest to date , contributes to growing evidence suggesting that PBDEs have adverse impacts on child neurobehavioral development .	11 1 122 12 112
11725347	Oncogenes are involved with the regulation of cellular proliferation and thus could be important in the development of many cancers . Cells transformed in culture by ras genes can be activated either by the introduction of specific point mutations or by overexpression of the normal proto-oncogene . The ras genes encode a protein of 189 amino acids ( molecular mass 21 kDa ) designated as p21. ras p21 proteins are contained in all eukaryotic cells on the inner surface of the plasma membrane . We measured ras p21 proteins in lung cancer patients , patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and workers exposed to emissions from petrochemical plants and 1,3-butadiene and 1,3-butadiene/styrene . Proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by Western blotting and detected by chemiluminescence . A monoclonal pan-ras antibody was used as the primary antibody . Optical densities of the peak area of the protein bands were calculated and values which were two standard deviations above negative control means were considered positive . Many of the cancer patients and some of the COPD patients gave positive responses , whilst exposed worker groups did not show statistically significant increases by comparison with the controls . Thus , an increase in ras oncoproteins could be a biomarker for cancer or the disease state in general , but it cannot be ruled out that it is a biomarker for exposure since many of the individuals examined were smokers exposed to cigarette smoke .	11 1 11123 111 1112
23164520	In this study , we aimed to investigate the association between in utero toxic ( lead [ Pb ] and arsenic [ As] ) and essential element ( zinc [ Zn] ) levels and neurodevelopmental indicators after birth in Chitwan Valley , Nepal . We conducted a hospital-based birth cohort study with 100 pregnant women in Chitwan , Nepal . We measured Pb , As , and Zn concentrations in cord blood . We assessed 100 infants at 1 day after birth , using the Brazelton neonatal behavioral assessment scale , third edition ( NBAS III ) . Multivariate regression was performed to adjust for mother's age , parity , educational level , and body mass index ( BMI ) ; family income ; and newborn's birth weight , gestational age , and age in hours at the time of NBAS III assessment . Among the 7 clusters of NBAS III , the motor cluster score was inversely associated with the cord blood levels of Pb ( coefficient=-2.15 , at 95% confidence interval [ CI]=-4.27 to -0.03 ) . The cord blood levels of As were inversely associated with the state regulation cluster score ( coefficient=-6.71 , at 95% CI=-12.17 to -1.24 ) . The cord blood levels of Zn were not associated with NBAS III scores . The cord blood levels of Pb and As , but not Zn , showed significant inverse association with the neurodevelopment of newborns . These results suggest that high levels of Pb or As exposure during the prenatal period may induce retardation during in utero neurodevelopment .	11 1 122 12 112
24373737	Despite the recent popularity of e-cigarettes , to date only limited data is available on their safety for both users and secondhand smokers . The present study reports a comprehensive inner and outer exposure assessment of e-cigarette emissions in terms of particulate matter ( PM ) , particle number concentrations ( PNC ) , volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , carbonyls , and metals . In six vaping sessions nine volunteers consumed e-cigarettes with and without nicotine in a thoroughly ventilated room for two hours . We analyzed the levels of e-cigarette pollutants in indoor air and monitored effects on FeNO release and urinary metabolite profile of the subjects . For comparison , the components of the e-cigarette solutions ( liquids ) were additionally analyzed . During the vaping sessions substantial amounts of 1,2-propanediol , glycerine and nicotine were found in the gas-phase , as well as high concentrations of PM2.5 ( mean 197Î¼g/m(3) ) . The concentration of putative carcinogenic PAH in indoor air increased by 20% to 147ng/m(3) , and aluminum showed a 2.4-fold increase . PNC ranged from 48,620 to 88,386 particles/cm(3) ( median ) , with peaks at diameters 24-36nm . FeNO increased in 7 of 9 individuals . The nicotine content of the liquids varied and was 1.2-fold higher than claimed by the manufacturer . Our data confirm that e-cigarettes are not emission-free and their pollutants could be of health concern for users and secondhand smokers . In particular , ultrafine particles formed from supersaturated 1,2-propanediol vapor can be deposited in the lung , and aerosolized nicotine seems capable of increasing the release of the inflammatory signaling molecule NO upon inhalation . In view of consumer safety , e-cigarettes and nicotine liquids should be officially regulated and labeled with appropriate warnings of potential health effects , particularly of toxicity risk in children .	12 23 1 2 125 127 232
24368508	Consumption of arsenic-contaminated drinking water is associated with increased cancer risk . The relationship between arsenic body burden , such as concentrations in human toenails , and arsenic in drinking water is not fully understood . We evaluated the relationship between arsenic concentrations in drinking water and toenail clippings among a cohort of Nova Scotians . A total of 960 men and women aged 35 to 69 years provided home drinking water and toenail clipping samples . Information on water source and treatment use and covariables was collected through questionnaires . Arsenic concentrations in drinking water and toenail clippings and anthropometric indices were measured . Private drilled water wells had higher arsenic concentrations compared with other dug wells and municipal drinking water sources ( P&lt;0.001 ) . Among participants with drinking water arsenic levels â¥1âÎ¼g/l , there was a significant relationship between drinking water and toenail arsenic concentrations ( r=0.46 , P&lt;0.0001 ) . Given similar levels of arsenic exposure from drinking water , obese individuals had significantly lower concentrations of arsenic in toenails compared with those with a normal weight . Private drilled water wells were an important source of arsenic exposure in the study population . Body weight modifies the relationship between drinking water arsenic exposure and toenail arsenic concentrations .	24 12 1 123 241 2
15743726	Blood concentrations of 11 volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) were measured up to four times over 2 years in a probability sample of more than 150 children from two poor , minority neighborhoods in Minneapolis , Minnesota . Blood levels of benzene , carbon tetrachloride , trichloroethene , and m-/p-xylene were comparable with those measured in selected adults from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) , whereas concentrations of ethylbenzene , tetrachloroethylene , toluene , 1,1,1-trichloroethane , and o-xylene were two or more times lower in the children . Blood levels of styrene were more than twice as high , and for about 10% of the children 1,4-dichlorobenzene levels were greater than or equal to 10 times higher compared with NHANES III subjects . We observed strong statistical associations between numerous pairwise combinations of individual VOCs in blood ( e.g. , benzene and m-/p-xylene , m-/p-xylene and o-xylene , 1,1,1-trichloroethane and m-/p-xylene , and 1,1,1-trichloroethane and trichloroethene ) . Between-child variability was higher than within-child variability for 1,4-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethylene . Between- and within-child variability were approximately the same for ethylbenzene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane , and between-child was lower than within-child variability for the other seven compounds . Two-day , integrated personal air measurements explained almost 79% of the variance in blood levels for 1,4-dichlorobenzene and approximately 20% for tetrachloroethylene , toluene , m-/p-xylene , and o-xylene . Personal air measurements explained much less of the variance ( between 0.5 and 8% ) for trichloroethene , styrene , benzene , and ethylbenzene . We observed no significant statistical associations between total urinary cotinine ( a biomarker for exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ) and blood VOC concentrations . For siblings living in the same household , we found strong statistical associations between measured blood VOC concentrations .	12 23 1 122 2 127 233
11759161	In this study we determined the concentrations of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPyr ) in urine samples from the general population . TCPyr is a specific metabolite of the organophosphorus pesticides chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl . By the introduction of a new sensitive analytical method a limit of quantification ( LOQ ) of 0.1 microgram per litre urine could be achieved , a tenfold improvement of recent methods . Extraction of TCPyr from the urine and the clean up process were carried out by automatic steam distillation . Separation and quantitative analysis were performed using capillary gas chromatography and mass selective detection in selected ion monitoring mode . The excretion of TCPyr was studied by analysing spontaneous urine samples from 5 women and 45 men between the ages of 22 and 57 ( median : 40 years ) living in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( Germany ) who were not occupationally exposed to organophosporus pesticides . TCPyr was detected in all specimens and the concentrations were quantified . The median excretion was 1.4 micrograms/l ( range : 0.12 to 124.8 micrograms/l ) , the 95th percentile 11.3 micrograms/l . Under the worst case assumption that all TCPyr measured in urine originated from the intake of intact pesticides and not ( less toxic ) breakdown products , a TCPyr concentration of 1.4 micrograms/l urine corresponds to a daily intake of approximately 2.5 micrograms chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-methyl . The intake at the 95th percentile would be about 23 micrograms chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-methyl per day . According to FAO/WHO the acceptable daily intake ( ADI ) is 10 micrograms per kg bodyweight and day for both chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl .	1 2 12 21 127
23196407	The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of total and inorganic arsenic in dietary supplements composed of herbal plants and seaweed , and to determine the potential toxicological risk . Total arsenic was determined by dry ashing and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry , and inorganic arsenic was determined by acid digestion , solvent extraction , and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry . Total and inorganic arsenic in the supplements ranged from 0.07 to 8.31mgâkg(-1) dry weight and from 0.14 to 0.28mgâkg(-1) dry weight , respectively . Daily intake of total arsenic ranged from 0.05 to 12.46Î¼gâday(-1) . Inorganic arsenic intake ranged from 0.21 to 0.83Î¼gâday(-1) , values that are below the Benchmark Dose Lower Confidence Limit recommended by the Word Health Organization . Therefore , there appears to be a low risk of adverse effects resulting from excess inorganic arsenic intake from these supplements . This is the first study conducted in Mexico that investigates total and inorganic arsenic in dietary supplements . Although the results do not suggest toxicological risk , it is nonetheless important considering the toxicity of inorganic arsenic and the increasing number consumer preferences for dietary supplements . Moreover , it is important to improve and ensure the safety of dietary supplements containing inorganic arsenic .	24 244 2
23201820	Persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) exert harmful effects on cognitive , endocrine and immune functions and bioaccumulate in the environment and human tissues . The aim of this study was to investigate the body burden of several POPs in the adult population ( n=246 ) and their association to diet and other lifestyle factors in a Swedish national survey . Serum concentrations of several polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and the pesticides hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , Î²-hexachlorocyclohexane ( Î²-HCH ) , chlordane compounds and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE ) were determined by liquid-liquid extraction , silica column cleanup and gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry . Diet was assessed using 4-day food records and complementary dietary and lifestyle factors by questionnaire . Fish intake was additionally assessed by plasma fatty acid composition . Clustering of the compounds revealed that PCBs were separated into two clusters , one including low-chlorinated PCB 28 and 52 , and the other high-chlorinated mono- and di-ortho PCBs , suggesting similarities and dissimilarities in exposure sources and possibly also toxicokinetics . Men had 24% and 32% higher levels of PCB 138-180 and chlordane compounds , respectively , compared with women . This may partly be explained by elimination of the POPs among women reporting a history of breastfeeding . The proportion of very long-chain n-3 fatty acids in plasma were positively correlated with the pollutants : r=0.24 ( PCB 28 ) , r=0.33 ( PCB 118 ) , r=0.35 ( PCB 138-180 ) , r=0.29 ( HCB ) , r=0.18 ( Î²-HCH ) , r=0.34 ( chlordane compounds ) , r=0.34 ( p,p'-DDE ) , pâ¤0.005 . Individuals consuming fatty Baltic fishâ¥1 time per months had 45% higher serum levels of PCB 118 compared with non-consumers . Levels of PCB 28 were associated with the age of the residential building . To conclude , the population-distributed approach of surveying dietary habits , lifestyle factors and POP body burdens , made it possible to identify personal characteristics associated with the POP body burdens in Sweden .	24 12 1 122 2 243
15721879	There is a rising global concern with regard to mercury ( Hg ) exposure among coastal populations . Two communities on the Bay of Fundy ( New Brunswick , Canada ) were assessed by hair monitoring and dietary methods . Average concentration of total Hg in hair was 0.70+/-0.55 mg/kg ( N=91 ) at Grand Manan and 0.42+/-0.15 mg/kg ( N=52 ) at St. Andrews/St . Stephen . Average daily consumption of fresh fish and shellfish was 50+/-40 g/day for Grand Manan and 19+/-19 g/day for St. Andrews/St . Stephen . Average daily total Hg intake estimated from the food frequency and 24-h recall questionnaires was 0.05+/-0.04 microg Hg/kg bw/day at Grand Manan and 0.03+/-0.04 microg Hg/kg bw/day at St. Andrews/St . Stephen . A significant correlation ( r=0.47 , P=0.002 ) between Hg intake and hair was observed for Grand Manan . Low Hg intakes and body burden can be attributed to the low Hg levels found in the species commonly consumed : haddock , canned tuna , lobster , and pollock ( all below 0.2 microg/g wet weight ) . The results showed that Hg exposure in these Canadian coastal communities is low ; fish with higher levels of Hg ( shark , tuna , swordfish , pickerel , and bass ) are not consumed locally .	24 12 1 123 243 2
23204289	BACKGROUND A number of studies have shown associations between chronic exposure to particulate air pollution and increased mortality , particularly from cardiovascular disease , but fewer studies have examined the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and specific cardiovascular events , such as acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . OBJECTIVE We examined how long-term exposure to area particulate matter affects the onset of AMI , and we distinguished between area and local pollutants . METHODS Building on the Worcester Heart Attack Study , an ongoing community-wide investigation examining changes over time in myocardial infarction incidence in greater Worcester , Massachusetts , we conducted a case-control study of 4,467 confirmed cases of AMI diagnosed between 1995 and 2003 and 9,072 matched controls selected from Massachusetts resident lists . We used a prediction model based on satellite aerosol optical depth ( AOD ) measurements to generate both exposure to particulate matter â¤ 2.5 Î¼m in diameter ( PM2.5 ) at the area level ( 10 Ã 10 km ) and the local level ( 100 m ) based on local land use variables . We then examined the association between area and local particulate pollution and occurrence of AMI . RESULTS An interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in area PM2.5 ( 0.59 Î¼g/m3 ) was associated with a 16% increase in the odds of AMI ( 95% CI : 1.04 , 1.29 ) . An IQR increase in total PM2.5 ( area + local , 1.05 Î¼g/m3 ) was weakly associated with a 4% increase in the odds of AMI ( 95% CI : 0.96 , 1.11 ) . CONCLUSIONS Residential exposure to PM2.5 may best be represented by a combination of area and local PM2.5 , and it is important to consider spatial gradients within a single metropolitan area when examining the relationship between particulate matter exposure and cardiovascular events .	2 231 23
11771928	It has been suggested that selenium ( Se ) exhibits protective effects against mercury ( Hg ) toxicity in humans due to formation of a Hg-Se complex bound to selenoprotein P in blood . The aim of the present study was to investigate Se concentrations in persons who had been examined with respect to general health problems associated with dental amalgam fillings . The Se concentrations were determined in whole-blood samples of 80 individuals by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry . The subjects comprised two main groups : 21 healthy controls with amalgam fillings and 20 patients who claimed symptoms from existing amalgam fillings . The median concentration of Se in blood ( 119.2 microg/L ) was statistically significantly lower in subjects who claimed symptoms of mercury amalgam illness than in healthy subjects with amalgam ( 130.3 microg/L ) . The difference was more evident in individuals with more than 35 amalgam surfaces ( P=0.003 ) . Additional control groups without amalgam fillings comprised 19 healthy controls without amalgam experience and 20 subjects who have had amalgam fillings removed due to suspected symptoms associated with amalgam . The Se concentrations in these groups were not different from those with amalgam . It is indicated that persons with ill health self-related to dental amalgam might have a Se metabolism different from that of healthy people .	24 244 2
15713328	To better understand the magnitude of arsenic contamination in groundwater and its effects on human beings , a detailed study was carried out in Jalangi , one of the 85 arsenic affected blocks in West Bengal , India . Jalangi block is approximately 122 km2 in size and has a population of 215538 . Of the 1916 water samples analyzed ( about 31% of the total hand tubewells ) from the Jalangi block , 77.8% were found to have arsenic above 10 microg l(-1) [ the World Health Organization ( WHO)-recommended level of arsenic in drinking water ] , 51% had arsenic above 50 microg l(-1) ( the Indian standard of permissible limit of arsenic in drinking water ) and 17% had arsenic at above 300 microg l(-1) ( the concentration predicting overt arsenical skin lesions ) . From our preliminary medical screening , 1488 of the 7221 people examined in the 44 villages of Jalangi block exhibit definite arsenical skin lesions . An estimation of probable population that may suffer from arsenical skin lesions and cancer in the Jalangi block has been evaluated comparing along with international data . A total of 1600 biologic samples including hair , nail and urine have been analyzed from the affected villages of Jalangi block and on an average 88% of the biologic samples contain arsenic above the normal level . Thus , a vast population of the block may have arsenic body burden . Cases of Bowen's disease and cancer have been identified among adults who also show arsenical skin lesions and children in this block are also seriously affected . Obstetric examinations were also carried out in this block .	11 24 12 127 1 123 241 112 2
24345328	Background : Because human exposure to persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) occurs mainly through ingestion of contaminated food , regulatory bodies issue dietary consumption advisories to describe safe intake levels for food items of concern , particularly fish.Objectives : Our study goal was to estimate the effectiveness of fish consumption advisories in reducing exposure of infants and children to POPs.Methods : We used the time-variant mechanistic model CoZMoMAN to estimate and compare prenatal , postnatal , and childhood exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl congener PCB-153 under different scenarios of maternal guideline adherence for both hypothetical constant and realistic time-variant chemical emissions . The scenarios differed in terms of length of compliance ( 1 vs. 5 years ) , extent of fish substitution ( all vs. half ) , and replacement diet ( uncontaminated produce vs. beef ) . We also estimated potential exposure reductions for a range of theoretical chemicals to explore how guideline effectiveness varies with a chemical's partitioning and degradation properties.Results : When assuming realistic time periods of advisory compliance , our findings suggest that temporarily eliminating or reducing maternal fish consumption is largely ineffective in reducing pre- and postnatal exposure to substances with long elimination half-lives in humans , especially during periods of decreasing environmental emissions . Substituting fish with beef may actually result in higher exposure to certain groups of environmental contaminants . On the other hand , advisories may be highly effective in reducing exposure to substances with elimination half-lives in humans shorter than the length of compliance.Conclusions : Our model estimates suggest that fish consumption advisories are unlikely to be effective in reducing prenatal , postnatal , and childhood exposures to compounds with long elimination half-lives in humans.Citation : Binnington MJ , Quinn CL , McLachlan MS , Wania F. 2014 .

15664440	Experiments were designed to evaluate and compare metallothionein ( MT ) , zinc and cadmium levels in human placentas of smoking and non-smoking women . Smoking was assessed by self-reported cigarette consumption and urine cotinine levels before delivery . Smoking pregnant women with urine cotinine levels higher than 130 ng/ml were included in the smoking group . Determination of placental MT was performed by western blot analysis after tissue homogenization and saturation with cadmium chloride ( 1000 ppm ) . Metallothionein was analyzed with a monoclonal antibody raised against MT-1 and MT-2 and with a second anti mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase . Zinc and cadmium were determined by neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption spectrometry respectively . Smokers showed higher placental MT and cadmium levels , together with decreased newborn birth weights , as compared to non-smokers . The semi-quantitative analysis of western blots by band densitometry indicated that darker bands corresponded to MT present in smokers ' samples . This study confirms that cigarette smoking increases cadmium accumulation in placental tissue and suggests that this element has a stimulatory effect on placental MT production .	11 12 127 1 11123 111 126 112 1112
15639267	Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were monitored in Belgian human adipose tissue samples from deceased individuals ( n=100 ) . Their mean age was 52 , ranging from 2 to 91 years . There were 57 men and 43 women . Other known variables were date of autopsy and place of residence . No information about diet or occupation was available . The seven marker congeners PCB 28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 and 180 were analysed in the samples with a GC-MS/MS method validated according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC . Extracted fat was cleaned-up over a glass column filled with n-hexane , acid silica , deactivated alumina and anhydrous sodium sulfate . The whole procedure was subjected to a rigorous quality control programme with retention times , ion chromatograms and intensity ratios of the monitored product ions as identification criteria . The total PCB concentration ranged between 10 and 1640 ng g-1 fat , with a mean value of 658 ng g-1 fat . In the age groups of 0-9 ( n=1 ) , 10-19 ( n=4 ) , 20-29 ( n=11 ) , 30-39 ( n=13 ) , 40-49 ( n=15 ) , 50-59 ( n=14 ) , 60-69 ( n=14 ) , 70-79 ( n=20 ) , 80-89 ( n=6 ) and 90-99 ( n=2 ) , the mean total PCB concentrations were 10 , 134 , 253 , 445 , 557 , 687 , 807 , 962 , 959 , and 1191 ng g-1 fat , respectively . So , there was an increase of PCB body burden with age . For the male subjects ( n=57 ; mean age of 53 ) the mean total PCB concentration was 633 ng g-1 fat . For the female subjects ( n=43 ; mean age of 52 ) it was 690 ng g-1 fat . There was no significant sex-related difference in the concentrations of marker PCBs .	1 121 12
15613949	BACKGROUND Chronic exposure to arsenic through drinking water has the potential to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes , although the association has not been demonstrated conclusively . This cross-sectional study assessed the association between arsenic in drinking water and spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , and neonatal death . METHODS In this cross-sectional study , 533 women were interviewed . Information on sociodemographic characteristics , drinking water use , and adverse pregnancy outcomes was obtained through a structured pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire . The respondents reported use of a total of 223 tube wells ; for 208 wells , water samples were measured using an ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry method , whereas 15 were measured by flow-injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry ( FIHG-AAS ) . RESULTS Excess risks for spontaneous abortion and stillbirth were observed among the participants chronically exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic in drinking water after adjusting for participant's height , history of hypertension and diabetes , and ( for neonatal death only ) age at first pregnancy . Comparing exposure to arsenic concentration of greater than 50 microg/L with 50 microg/L or less , the odds ratios were 2.5 ( 95% confidence interval=1.5-4.3 ) for spontaneous abortion , 2.5 ( 1.3-4.9 ) for stillbirth , and 1.8 ( 0.9-3.6 ) for neonatal death . CONCLUSIONS These study findings suggest that chronic arsenic exposure may increase the risk of fetal and infant death .	11 24 1 2 241 112
23250196	Personal exposures to carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( c-PAHs ) bound to airborne particulate matter îº2.5âÎ¼m ( PM2.5 ) were measured in the context of a large-scale molecular epidemiological study in order to identify the impacts of air pollution on human health . Sampling was carried out in three industrial cities in the Czech Republic : Ostrava , Karvina and Havirov . The city of Prague , exhibiting much lower industrial air pollution but a high level of traffic , served as a control . The first monitoring campaigns were held in winter and were repeated in the summer of 2009 . The active personal monitors PV 1.7 for PM2.5-bound c-PAHs were used . Non-smoking city policemen from Prague , Karvina and Havirov , and office workers from Ostrava , participated in the study . All participants completed a personal questionnaire and a time-location-activity diary . The average personal winter exposure to c-PAHs ( sum of the eight PAHs-benz[a]anthracene , benzo[a]pyrene , benzo[b]fluoranthene , benzo[g,h,i]perylene , benzo[k]fluoranthene , chrysene , dibenz[a,h]anthracene and indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene ) was highest in Karvina , 39.1 , followed by Ostrava at 15.1 and Prague at 4.3âng/m(3) . The winter levels were significantly higher than the summer values ( P&lt;0.001 ) : 4.3 in Karvina , 3.0 in Ostrava , 1.6 in Havirov and 1.0âng/m(3) in Prague . The average personal benzo[a]pyrene winter/summer exposures were : 6.9/0.6 in Karvina , 2.5/0.4 in Ostrava , 0.8/0.1 in Prague and 0.2âng/m(3) in summer in Havirov . In this study , we examined personal exposure to c-PAHs and tested it for associations with potential predictor variables collected from questionnaires , addressing life style factors and day-to-day activities . We found outdoor concentration , environmental tobacco smoke exposure , home heating fuel of coal , wood or gas , frequency of exhaust fan use , cooking and commuting by a car to be the main determinants of personal exposure .	2 233 23
9438048	Recent studies have shown a strong positive correlation between chromosomal aberrations and future cancer risk . Sister chromatid exchange ( SCE ) has been widely applied in monitoring early biological effects to assess human genetic risk of cancer at the population level . We studied 45 Chinese workers ( 23 in the painting workshop of a glass factory with occupational exposure to benzene , and 22 fitters and planers in the punching and planing machine workshops of a nearby shipyard without such an exposure ) to examine the association between occupational exposure to benzene and SCE frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes . We also sought to investigate whether the glutathione S-transferase class theta gene ( GSTT1 ) affects individual susceptibility to cytogenetic damage induced by in vivo exposure to benzene or in vitro exposure to diepoxybutane . The time-weighted average concentrations of benzene were 0.71 ppm in the exposed group and 0.03 ppm in the non-exposed group . Controlling for age , gender and educational level , cigarette smoking was significantly associated with increased SCE frequencies ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , while GSTT1 genotype was significantly associated with DEB-induced SCEs ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) . There was no relationship between benzene exposure and baseline or DEB-induced SCEs . After stratification by smoking status , the GSTT1 deletion was a significant predictor of DEB-induced SCEs for both smokers ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) and nonsmokers ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) . A significant benzene-GSTT1 interaction was found in nonsmokers ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) . Our study suggests that GSTT1 is an important determinant of heterogeneity in individual susceptibility to chromosomal damage associated with exposure to benzene .	11 1111 23 1 2 111 232
24296133	Arsenic species were determined in rice and bulgur samples that were collected from 50 participants who also supplied exposure related information through a questionnaire survey . Speciation analysis was conducted using an HPLC-ICP-MS system . Ingestion exposure to arsenic and associated health risks were assessed by combining the concentration and questionnaire data both for individual participants and the subject population . Inorganic arsenic dominated both in rice and bulgur but concentrations were about an order of magnitude higher in rice ( 160Â±38ng/g ) than in bulgur . Because participants also consumed more rice than bulgur , exposures were significantly higher for rice resulting in carcinogenic risks above acceptable level for 53% and 93% of the participants when the in-effect and the proposed potencies were used , respectively , compared to 0% and 5% for bulgur . An inorganic arsenic standard for rice would be useful to lower the risks while public awareness about the relation between excessive rice consumption and health risks is built , and bulgur consumption is promoted .	24 2 243
15575555	Urine samples from the 2001/2002 pilot study for the German Environmental Survey on children ( GerES IV ) were analysed for concentrations of the primary DEHP metabolite MEHP ( mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ) and two secondary DEHP metabolites SOH-MEHP ( 2-ethyl-5-hydroxy-hexylphthalate ) and 5oxo-MEHP ( 2-ethyl-5-oxo-hexylphthalate ) . Urine samples had been taken from 254 children aged 3 to 14 . In addition , DEHP was analysed in house dust samples . These samples had been collected with vacuum cleaners in the homes of the children . The geometric mean ( GM ) was 7.9 microg/l for MEHP in urine , and the GMs for the secondary metabolites 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP were 52.1 microg/l and 39.9 microg/l. 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP concentrations were highly correlated ( r = 0.98 ) . The correlations of 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP with MEHP were also high ( r = 0.72 and r = 0.70 ) . The concentrations of 5OH-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP were 8.0-fold and 6.2-fold higher than the concentrations of MEHP . The ratios 5OH-MEHP/Soxo-MEHP and 5oxo-MEHP/MEHP decreased with increasing age . Boys showed higher concentrations than girls for all three metabolites of DEHP in urine . Children aged 13-14 had the lowest mean concentrations of the secondary metabolites in urine . The house dust analyses revealed DEHP contamination of all samples . The GM was 508 mg/kg dust . No correlation could be observed between the levels of any of the urinary DEHP metabolites and those of DEHP in house dust .	24 12 127 1 2 242
24292950	The search for reliable biomarkers of human exposure to benzene and its derivatives is still subject of research . Many of the proposed biomarkers have limitations ranging from the low sensitivity to the wide variability of results . Thus , the aim of our study was to assess the frequencies of chromosomal abnormalities ( CA ) and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCE ) in workers of gas stations , with ( cases , nâ=â19 ) and without ( local controls , nâ=â6 ) risk of exposure to benzene and its derivatives , comparing them with the results from the general population ( external controls , nâ=â38 ) . The blood dosages of benzene , toluene , and xylenes were measured in all participants . Blood solvent levels were compared with the findings obtained in cytogenetic evaluation and a research protocol which included data of the workplace , lifestyle , and health of the individuals . We did not detect the presence of benzene and its derivatives and did not find chromosomal damage that may be associated with the gas station activity in cases . Moreover , although we found an association of increased SCE and the working time in the local controls , the values found for SCE are within normal limits . Thus , our evaluation of SCE and CA reflected the levels of benzene and its derivatives observed in the blood . We believe , therefore , that SCE and CA may actually constitute possible tests for the evaluation of these exposures . However , we believe that further studies , including individuals at risk , are important to confirm this assertion .	11 1111 12 1 122 111
23261793	BACKGROUND Cadmium is a wide-spread pollutant . Observational studies suggest associations between cadmium and prevalence of type 2 diabetes . Experimental studies indicate that cadmium may cause impaired insulin production . OBJECTIVES To examine whether cadmium exposure is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes and impaired pancreatic beta-cell function . METHODS Oral glucose tolerance tests were used in a screening examination of 64-year old women ( n=2595 ) to identify all with diabetes , impaired ( IGT ) and normal ( NGT ) glucose tolerance . Random samples of women with type 2 diabetes ( n=215 ) , IGT ( n=207 ) and NGT ( n=194 ) were recruited in a cross-sectional examination including measurement of pancreatic insulin production ( acute insulin response ) and insulin sensitivity ( homeostasis model assessment ) . Cadmium concentrations were measured in blood and urine . A follow-up examination was performed after 5.4 years with assessment of new cases with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance . RESULTS At baseline , neither blood nor urinary cadmium concentrations showed any statistically significant differences between women with type 2 diabetes , IGT or NGT . The prospective analysis included 68 cases with incident diabetes , 58 with IGT and 118 women with NGT and no associations with cadmium levels at baseline were observed . Blood and urinary cadmium at baseline were not associated with insulin production , blood glucose , HbA1c , or changes in HbA1c during follow-up . CONCLUSIONS This is the first study of cadmium and diabetes with detailed data on pancreatic beta-cell function , insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance . Cadmium exposure was not associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes or IGT .	11 12 127 122 1 11122 11123 111 112 1112
24291653	Fourteen tri-deca polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were investigated in 35 human milk samples from Birmingham , UK . While none of the hepta-nona BDEs ( the main components of the octaBDE technical mixture ) was above the limit of quantitation ( LOQ ) ; BDE-47 ( average concentration=3.3ngg(-1) lipid weight ( lw) ) was quantified in all samples contributing 34-74% to Î£tri-hexa BDEs ( the principal constituents of the pentaBDE commercial formulation ) . BDE-209 ( the main congener in the decaBDE formulation ) was present above the LOQ in 69% of samples ( average concentration=0.31ngg(-1) lw ) . Concentrations of Î£tri-hexa BDEs ranged from 0.2 to 26ngg(-1) lw with concentrations of BDE-47&gt;BDE-153&gt;BDE-99 . While concentrations of Î£tri-hexa BDEs in this study ( average=5.95ngg(-1) lw ) were at the high end of those reported from other European countries , concentrations of BDE-209 were lower than those reported in human milk from other countries . The average exposure of a UK nursing infant to Î£tri-hexa BDEs ( 35ng ( kg bw)(-1)day(-1) ) via breast milk exceeded the upper-bound dietary intakes of both UK adults and toddlers . Using a simple one compartment pharmacokinetic model , PBDE intakes of UK adults via inhalation , diet and dust ingestion were converted to predicted body burdens . Predictions compared well with those observed for Î£tri-hexa BDEs and BDE-209 in breast milk .	24 12 21 23 1 2 124 243 242
23261794	BACKGROUND Phthalates are prevalent environmental exposure chemicals with rising concern on various health effects , including pulmonary function . Meanwhile , elderly people are more susceptible to environmental exposure , and their decreasing lung function is an important health issue . OBJECTIVES To investigate the association between urinary phthalate metabolite levels and indices for pulmonary function , and evaluate effect modification by genetic polymorphisms of oxidative-stress related genes , catalase ( CAT ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD2 ) , and myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) in elderly Koreans . METHODS We conducted a panel study on 418 individuals over 60 years old in Seoul , Korea , and repeatedly measured urinary phthalate metabolite levels and ran pulmonary function tests . Genetic polymorphisms of CAT ( rs769218 , rs769217 ) , SOD2 ( rs4880 , rs2758331 , rs5746136 ) and MPO ( rs2071409 , rs7208693 ) were determined . Mixed effect model was used to investigate association of phthalate levels with pulmonary function indices and to examine the effect of CAT , SOD2 and MPO polymorphisms on the association . RESULTS Inverse association was demonstrated between sum of mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate ( âDEHP ) levels and FEV1/FVC ( Î²=-0.632 , p=0.0275 ) or FEF25-75 ( Î²=-0.077 , p=0.025 ) after adjusting for age , months after previous measurements , sex , body mass index , cotinine , mean temperature and dew point . The effect of âDEHP on lung function was significant only in subjects with certain genotypes , and having all significant genotypes in three genes showed significant difference in the phthalate-pulmonary function association ( FEV1/FVC : Î²=-2.169 , p=0.0032 ; FEF25-75 : Î²=-0.155 , p=0.0103 ) , while other combinations showed less estimate size without any significance . CONCLUSIONS Urinary phthalate metabolites levels are associated with decreasing pulmonary function in elderly Koreans , and effect modification of certain CAT , SOD2 and MPO polymorphisms on the association is suggested .	11 1 127 12 112
9456085	A mercapturic acid attached to the aromatic ring of toluene was for the first time detected in human urine as a metabolite of toluene . Since the metabolism of toluene is usually considered to take place at the side-chain , this gives , besides the biosynthesis of cresols , a further hint of a metabolic conversion of the aromatic system . We examined a group of 33 workers occupationally exposed to toluene , determining the concentrations of toluene in ambient air and in whole blood , o-cresol and hippuric acid in urine and p-toluylmercapturic acid ( p-TMA ) in urine . All blood and urine samples were collected post-shift . The renal excretion of S-p-toluylmercapturic acid showed highly significant correlations with established parameters of a biological monitoring of toluene . The median ambient air concentration was 63 ppm , ranging from 13 to 151 ppm , the median concentration of toluene in whole blood was 804 microg/l , corresponding to median urinary concentrations for o-cresol of 2.3 mg/l , hippuric acid of 2.3 g/l and p-TMA of 20.4 microg/l. p-TMA was not detectable in urine samples of a control group of 10 non-exposed persons . Both the German Biological Tolerance Values ( BAT-values ) for toluene in blood ( 1000 microg/l ) and o-cresol in urine ( 3 mg/l ) correspond to a mean p-TMA elimination of approximately 50 microg/l , and thus are in agreement with each other . According to our results p-TMA reflects internal toluene exposure diagnostically sensitive and specifical . With the developed analytical procedure we determined a median benzylmercapturic acid ( BMA ) concentration of 190 microg/l in the urine samples of the toluene exposed persons . We also determined a median BMA concentration of 30 microg/l in the control samples of non-exposed persons . However , these results are preliminary and require further confirmation as the reliability of the method was determined only for p-TMA .	12 23 1 122 2 127 232
23276485	Few studies investigated the association between chronic arsenic exposure and the mortality of cancers by estimating individual urinary arsenic methylation profiles . Therefore , we compared with the general population in Taiwan to calculate the standardized mortality ratio ( SMR ) in arseniasis-endemic area of Taiwan from 1996 to 2010 and evaluated the dose-response relationships between environmental arsenic exposure indices or urinary arsenic profiles and the mortality of cause-specific cancer . A cohort of 1563 residents was conducted and collected their urine sample and information regarding arsenic exposure from a questionnaire . All-cause death was identified using the National Death Registry of Taiwan . Urinary arsenic profiles were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-hydride generator-atomic absorption spectrometry . We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the mortality risks . In results , 193 all-site cancer deaths , and 29 , 71 , 43 deaths respectively for liver , lung and bladder cancers were ascertained . The SMRs were significantly high in arseniasis-endemic areas for liver , lung , and bladder cancers . People with high urinary InAs% or low DMA% or low secondary methylation index ( SMI ) were the most likely to suffer bladder cancer after adjusting other risk factors . Even stopping exposure to arsenic from the artesian well water , the mortality rates of the residents were higher than general population . Finally , urinary InAs% , DMA% and SMI could be the potential biomarkers to predict the mortality risk of bladder cancer .	1 12 127
9515061	Population-based studies of hospital usage have been used to identify the ongoing adverse impacts of photochemical air pollutants on respiratory health . In this study we examined the relationship between the number of daily emergency room ( ER ) visits for respiratory illnesses ( 25 hospitals ) and outdoor air pollution in Montreal , Quebec ( June-August , 1989-1990 ) . Air pollutants measured included 1- and 8-h maximum ozone ( O3 ) and estimated particulate matter &lt ; 2.5 microns in aerometric diameter ( PM2.5 ) . Seasonal and day-of-week trends , autocorrelation , temperature , and relative humidity were controlled for in-time series regressions . Although O3 levels never exceeded the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard ( NAAQS ) of 120 ppb ( maximum day , 106 ppb ) , statistically significant ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) relationships were found between respiratory ER visits for patients over the age of 64 and both 1- and 8-h maximum O3 measured 1 day prior to the ER visit day during the 1989 summer : ER visits were 18.7% higher than average ( 95% Cl , 6.5-30.9% ) for a mean increase of 44 ppb O3 ( 1-h maximum ) , and 21.8% higher than average ( 95% Cl , 9.7-33.8% ) for a mean increase of 38 ppb O3 ( 8-h maximum ) . There was an association between respiratory ER visits for the elderly and estimated PM2.5 lagged 1 day ( 0.1 visit/microgram/m3 PM2.5 , P &lt ; 0.07 ) , but this was confounded by both temperature and O3 . The only finding for a reference group of nonrespiratory conditions was an inverse association between ER visits for infants and O3 , but this was confounded by weather . These findings confirm the impression that while air quality standards may protect the respiratory health of the general population , this is not the case for susceptible subgroups such as the elderly .	2 231 23
15364595	Environmental measurements of organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides were conducted in the homes of 13 children , who lived either in the Seattle metropolitan area or in the agricultural region of Washington State , to ascertain exposure through multiple pathways . Each home was sampled for two 24-h periods during two seasons , summer and fall . Samples included 24-h indoor air , drinking water , soil , house dust , and hand and toy wipes and 24-h duplicate diets . At least one OP pesticide was found in each of the matrices sampled except for drinking water . Half of the indoor air samples contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos or diazinon . Detectable levels of diazinon and azinphosmethyl in house dust were found in most of the agricultural homes , whereas only diazinon was found in the Seattle homes in the summer . Quantifiable chlorpyrifos and azinphosmethyl were found on either agricultural children's hands or their toys . These findings suggest different exposure pathways for children living in agricultural and nonagricultural regions .	24 23 245 244 2 241 243 242 232
23290941	OBJECTIVE This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the relationship between exposure to cadmium and circulating reproductive hormone levels in urban and rural male workers . MATERIALS AND METHODS Urinary cadmium , blood cadmium , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and testosterone were obtained from 86 non-smoking traffic policemen and 86 subjects working as roadmen in a rural area . All subjects were monitored to evaluate airborne exposure to cadmium . RESULTS The mean value of exposure to cadmium was 1.3 ng m(-3) in traffic policemen , while the mean value was less than 0.5 ng m(-3) in roadmen . The mean concentrations of urinary cadmium ( 1.4 vs. 0.9 Î¼g g(-1) creatinine ; p=0.001 ) , blood cadmium ( 1.1 vs. 0.7 Î¼g l(-1) ; p=0.000 ) , FSH ( 2.6 vs. 3.2 Î¼lU ml(-1) ; p=0.02 ) and LH ( 2.6 vs. 3.1 Î¼lU ml(-1) ; p=0.03 ) were significantly different between traffic policemen and roadmen . No differences were found in the mean values of testosterone between the two groups . Multiple linear regression models showed associations between ( a ) urinary cadmium , airborne cadmium , working life , job category and consumption of water from water supply ( b ) blood cadmium , airborne cadmium and job category ( c ) the values of FSH and age , working life , job category , urinary cadmium and blood cadmium ( d ) the values of LH and both the age and working life . CONCLUSION The above results must be confirmed by further studies , but they indicate the influence of exposure to the cadmium present in urban air on the circulating FSH , even at low doses .	24 11 12 23 1 11121 122 11123 241 127 2 111 1112 233
24278238	BACKGROUND Triclosan-a ubiquitous chemical in toothpastes , soaps , and household cleaning supplies-has the potential to alter both gut microbiota and endocrine function and thereby affect body weight . METHODS We investigated the relationship between triclosan and body mass index ( BMI ) using National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES ) from 2003-2008 . BMI and spot urinary triclosan levels were obtained from adults . Using two different exposure measures-either presence vs. absence or quartiles of triclosan-we assessed the association between triclosan and BMI . We also screened all NHANES serum and urine biomarkers to identify correlated factors that might confound observed associations . RESULTS Compared with undetectable triclosan , a detectable level was associated with a 0.9-point increase in BMI ( p&lt;0.001 ) . In analysis by quartile , compared to the lowest quartile , the 2nd , 3rd and 4th quartiles of urinary triclosan were associated with BMI increases of 1.5 ( p&lt;0.001 ) , 1.0 ( pâ=â0.002 ) , and 0.3 ( pâ=â0.33 ) respectively . The one strong correlate of triclosan identified in NHANES was its metabolite , 2,4-dichlorophenol ( Ïâ=â0.4 ) ; its association with BMI , however , was weaker than that of triclosan . No other likely confounder was identified . CONCLUSIONS Triclosan exposure is associated with increased BMI . Stronger effect at moderate than high levels suggests a complex mechanism of action .	11 1 127 12 112
15331262	To assess the influence of a new hazardous waste incinerator ( HWI ) on public health , a preoperational monitoring program was established during the period of construction . In this study , the levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDD ) and dibenzofurans ( PCDF ) accumulated in adipose tissue of 15 autopsied subjects living in the area under potential impact of the HWI were determined after approximately 3 years of regular operations in the facility . The non-ortho PCBs 77 , 126 and 169 were also determined . PCDD/F concentrations ranged between 1.5 and 41 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 2.4 and 72 WHO-TEQ/g fat , respectively , including PCBs ) , with a mean value of 11 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat and a median value of 7.4 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 22 and 13 WHO-TEQ/g fat , respectively , including PCBs ) . In the baseline study , the mean level of PCDD/Fs was 36 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 61 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat , including non-ortho PCBs 77 , 126 and 169 ) , which means a reduction of 70% ( 64% including PCBs ) . This notable reduction is in accordance with the important decrease observed in recent years in PCDD/F intake through the diet . The current concentrations of PCDD/Fs in human adipose tissue , as well as recent data on PCDD/F levels in plasma and breast milk of subjects living in the vicinity of the same HWI , indicate that there is not any additional significant exposure to PCDD/Fs for this population .	1 121 12
9560354	To determine the contaminants that should be studied further in the subsequent population-based study , a profile of Great Lakes ( GL ) sport fish contaminant residues were studied in human blood and urine specimens from 32 sport fish consumers from three Great Lakes : Lake Michigan ( n = 10 ) , Lake Huron ( n = 11 ) , and Lake Erie ( n = 11 ) . Serum was analyzed for 8 polychlorinated dioxin congeners , 10 polychlorinated furan congeners , 4 coplanar and 32 other polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners , and 11 persistent chlorinated pesticides . Whole blood was analyzed for mercury and lead . Urine samples were analyzed for 10 nonpersistent pesticides ( or their metabolites ) and 5 metals . One individual was excluded from statistical analysis because of an unusual exposure to selected analytes . Overall , the sample ( n = 31 ) consumed , on average , 49 GL sport fish meals per year for a mean of 33 years . On average , the general population in the GL basin consume 6 meals of GL sport fish per year . The mean tissue levels of most persistent , bioaccumulative compounds also found in GL sport fish ranged from less than a twofold increase to that of PCB 126 , which was eight times the selected background levels found in the general population . The overall mean total toxic equivalent for dioxins , furans , and coplanar PCBs were greater than selected background levels in the general population ( dioxins , 1.8 times ; furans , 2.4 times ; and coplanar PCBs , 9.6 times ) . The nonpersistent pesticides and most metals were not identified in unusual concentrations . A contaminant pattern among lake subgroups was evident . Lake Erie sport fish consumers had consistently lower contaminant concentrations than consumers of sport fish from Lake Michigan and Huron . These interlake differences are consistent with contaminant patterns seen in sport fish tissue from the respective lakes ; GL sport fish consumption was the most likely explanation for observed contaminant levels among this sample . Frequent consumers of sport fish proved to be effective sentinels for identifying sport fish contaminants of concern . In the larger study to follow , serum samples will be tested for PCBs ( congener specific and coplanar ) , DDE , dioxin , and furans .	24 12 1 122 2 243 127
23312110	BACKGROUND Despite growing concern over potential health effects associated with exposures to the endocrine disruptor , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , insufficient information is available on determinants of BPA concentrations among minority populations in the US . OBJECTIVES To describe concentrations and predictors of BPA in an inner-city longitudinal birth cohort . METHODS We analyzed spot urines for total BPA collected during pregnancy and child ages 3 , 5 , and 7 years from African Americans and Dominicans ( n=568 ) enrolled in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health birth cohort and residing in Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx . Adjusting for specific gravity , generalized estimating equations were used to compare BPA concentrations across paired samples and linear regression analyses were used to determine relationships between BPA , season of sample collection , socio-demographic variables and urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites . RESULTS BPA was detected in â¥ 94% of samples . Prenatal concentrations were significantly lower than postnatal concentrations . Geometric means were higher among African Americans compared to Dominicans in prenatal ( p=0.008 ) , 5 year ( p&lt;0.001 ) and 7 year ( p=0.017 ) samples . Geometric means at 5 and 7 years were higher ( p=0.021 , p=0.041 respectively ) for children of mothers never married compared to mothers ever married at enrollment . BPA concentrations were correlated with phthalate metabolite concentrations at prenatal , 3 , 5 and 7 years ( p-values &lt;0.05 ) . Postnatal BPA concentrations were higher in samples collected during the summer . CONCLUSIONS This study shows widespread BPA exposure in an inner-city minority population . BPA concentration variations were associated with socio-demographic characteristics and other xenobiotics .	1 12 127
9593624	Methylmercury in serum ( S-MeHg ) was assessed from serum concentrations of total ( S-TotHg ) and inorganic mercury ( S-InoHg ) , determined by cold vapor-atomic absorption spectrometry . The samples were collected from 135 women on two occasions , in 1968-1969 and 1980-1981 . In a subgroup of 29 women , an association was found between S-MeHg and the amount of fish consumed in 1968-1969 ( r = 0.38 , P = 0.04 ) . The association was stronger ( r = 0.50 ; P = 0.006 ) when the individuals ' mean S-MeHg from 1968-1969 and 1980-1981 were plotted vs fish consumption 1968-1969 . In the group , as a whole , there was an association between S-InoHg and number of dental amalgam surfaces , in both 1968-1969 ( r = 0.48 , P = 0.0001 ) and 1980-1981 ( r = 0.57 , P &lt ; 0.0001 ) . The S-InoHg increased by approximately 0.1 nmol/L per amalgam tooth surface , corresponding to an uptake of approximately 0.2 microgram/day per amalgam surface , but with considerable interindividual differences . The levels were lower in 1980-1981 than in 1968-1969 for both MeHg and InoHg . The medians and ranges ( nmol/L ) were for MeHg 1968-1969 : 3.6 ( 0.3-11.9 ) ; MeHg 1980-1981 , 2.0 ( -0.4-8.7 ) ; InoHg 1968-1969 , 3.3 ( 0.7-11.8 ) ; InoHg 1980-1981 , 1.7 ( 0.1-11.8 ) ; TotHg 1968-1969 , 7.2 ( 1.9-18.8 ) ; and TotHg 1980-1981 , 3.9 ( 1.0-14.2 ) . The decrease in S-MeHg is probably due to a decreased consumption of MeHg via contaminated fish . The decrease in S-InoHg may reflect a decrease in environmental exposure , but the possibility of contamination of the 1968-1969 samples at sampling and/or storage cannot be excluded .	24 12 1 244 122 2 243
15289161	Exposure to methyl mercury , a risk factor for neurodevelopmental toxicity , was assessed in U.S. children 1-5 years of age ( n = 838 ) and women 16-49 years of age ( n = 1,726 ) using hair mercury analysis during the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) . The data are nationally representative and are based on analysis of cross-sectional data for the noninstitutionalized , U.S. household population . The survey consisted of interviews conducted in participants ' homes and standardized health examinations conducted in mobile examination centers . Distributions of total hair mercury levels expressed as micrograms per gram hair Hg and the association of hair Hg levels with sociodemographic characteristics and fish consumption are reported . Geometric mean ( standard error of the geometric mean ) hair mercury was 0.12 microg/g ( 0.01 microg/g ) in children , and 0.20 microg/g ( 0.02 microg/g ) in women . Among frequent fish consumers , geometric mean hair mercury levels were 3-fold higher for women ( 0.38 vs. 0.11 micro g/g ) and 2-fold higher for children ( 0.16 vs. 0.08 microg/g ) compared with nonconsumers . The NHANES 1999-2000 data provide population-based data on hair mercury concentrations for women and children in the United States . Hair mercury levels were associated with age and fish consumption frequency .	24 12 1 123 243 2
23321147	Because of the disadvantages of invasive sampling , it is desirable to explore non-invasive matrices for human biomonitoring of perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) . The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of nail , hair and urine for human biomonitoring of PFOS and PFOA . The concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in matched nail , hair , urine and serum samples collected from 64 donors were measured . The chemicals of interest were detected with high detection frequency in these matrices ( 90%-100% ) except for PFOA in urine samples ( 56% ) . Generally , the gender influences on the levels of PFOS and PFOA in these non-invasive matrices were in agreement with that in serum . For PFOS , the coefficients of Spearman correlation between serum samples and nail , hair and urine samples were 0.786 ( p&lt;0.001 ) , 0.545 ( p&lt;0.001 ) and 0.302 ( p&lt;0.05 ) , respectively . For PFOA , the correlation was only observed between nail samples and serum samples with a correlation coefficient of 0.299 ( p&lt;0.05 ) . The results suggested that nail has more potential than hair and urine to be applied in human biomonitoring for PFOS and PFOA in general populations .	1 122 12 127 123
9617382	BACKGROUND We conducted a population-based case-control study to describe the relationship between occupational exposure to estrogenic chemicals and the occurrence of breast cancer in Cape Cod , Massachusetts . METHODS Incident cases of breast cancer ( n = 261 ) diagnosed from 1983 through 1986 and controls ( n = 753 ) were interviewed to gather information on breast cancer risk factors and all full-time jobs held since age 18 . Blinded exposure assessments were employed using the data from the NIOSH National Occupational Exposure Survey , chemical production and usage information , and the expert judgement of a certified industrial hygienist . RESULTS Overall , 29.5% of cases and 32.5% of controls had probable occupational exposure to one or more xenoestrogens . Probable exposure to nonylphenol ( 21.5% of cases , 21.4% of controls ) , butyl benzyl phthalate ( 10.0% of cases , 13.2% of controls ) , BHA ( 7.3% of cases , 9.6% of controls ) , bisphenol A ( 9.6% of cases , 11.6% of controls ) , and 4-tert-butylphenol ( 2.7% of cases and 5.3% of controls ) were relatively commons , while probable exposure to the other xenestrogens was rare . Only PCBs and 4-octylphenol were associated with moderate increase in the odds of breast cancer ( PCBs : 5 exposed cases and 6 exposed controls , adjust odds ratio : 3.2 , 95% CI = 0.8-12.2 , and 4-octylphenol : 6 exposed cases and 5 exposed controls , adjusted odds ratio : 2.9 , 95% CI = 10.8 ) .	2 21
9617389	Art glass manufacturing is one of the most interesting examples of exposure to complex mixtures . Among the raw materials used are silica sand , borax , carbonates , nitrates of Ca , Na , K , and a great number of compounds that are mainly oxides of As , Sb , Al , Zn , Cr , Ni , Sn , Se , Cd , Mn , Cu , Co , Fe , Nd , Er , Eu , and La . In six art glass factories that use As or Sb as fining agents , the exposure to these elements was investigated in 32 workers by means of environmental and biological monitoring . Analysis was conducted by atomic absorption spectrometry ( AAS ) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) . The results confirmed that As , which is the main carcinogen in glass production , reaches high air concentrations and is generally above the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists ( ACGIH ) threshold limit value-time-weighted average ( TLV-TWA ) of 10 micrograms/m3 . When partly substituted by antimonial compounds , As air concentrations dropped dramatically , while the air levels of Sb ( which is considered less toxic but is classified as a class 2B carcinogen by IARC ) were relatively low and below the ACGIH TLV-TWA of 500 micrograms/m3 . Exposure to As and Sb also differed in the three types of jobs investigated : As was high in oven chargers , Sb was higher in batch mixers , and both elements were low in makers-formers . Eleven to 18 elements were detected : arsenic , Al , Ba , Sb , Pb , and Zn were the elements most frequently measured ( in tens , and in some cases hundreds , of micrograms/m3 ) , followed by B , Li , Mn , Se , Sn , Sr , Ce , La , and Nd ( in micrograms or in some cases tens of micrograms/m3 . The results of biological monitoring for As , Sb , and other elements were in agreement with environmental monitoring data . We concluded that multiple detection of elements is a useful tool ( or the evaluation of exposure to complex mixtures such as those used in the art glass industry and that such detection also allows a more accurate evaluation of related epidemiological data .	1 2 12 232 23
24267793	OBJECTIVE Toxic heavy metals are released to the environment constantly from unregulated electronic waste ( e-waste ) recycling in Guiyu , China , and thus may contribute to the elevation of mercury ( Hg ) and other heavy metals levels in human hair . We aimed to investigate concentrations of mercury in hair from Guiyu and potential risk factors and compared them with those from a control area where no e-waste processing occurs . METHODS A total of 285 human hair samples were collected from three villages ( including Beilin , Xianma , and Huamei ) of Guiyu ( n=205 ) and the control area , Jinping district of Shantou city ( n=80 ) . All the volunteers were administered a questionnaire regarding socio-demographic characteristics and other possible factors contributed to hair mercury concentration . Hair mercury concentration was analyzed by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry ( AFS ) . RESULTS Our results suggested that hair mercury concentrations in volunteers of Guiyu ( median , 0.99 ; range , 0.18-3.98Î¼g/g ) were significantly higher than those of Jinping ( median , 0.59 ; range , 0.12-1.63Î¼g/g ) . We also observed a higher over-limit ratio ( &gt;1Î¼g/g according to USEPA ) in Guiyu than in Jinping ( 48.29% vs. 11.25% , P&lt;0.001 ) . Logistic regression model showed that the variables of living house also served as an e-waste workshop , work related to e-waste , family income , time of residence in Guiyu , the distance between home and waste incineration , and fish intake were associated with hair mercury concentration . After multiple stepwise regression analysis , in the Guiyu samples , hair mercury concentration was found positively associated with the time residence in Guiyu ( Î²=0.299 , P&lt;0.001 ) , and frequency of shellfish intake ( Î²=0.184 , P=0.016 ) ; and negatively associated with the distance between home and waste incineration ( Î²=-0.190 , P=0.015 ) and whether house also served as e-waste workshop ( Î²=-0.278 , P=0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS This study investigated human mercury exposure and suggested elevated hair mercury concentrations in an e-waste recycling area , Guiyu , China . Living in Guiyu for a long time and work related to e-waste may primarily contribute to the high hair mercury concentrations .	24 12 1 123 243 2
9618352	This study concerns the metabolism of inorganic arsenic ( As ) in children in three villages in northern Argentina : San Antonio de los Cobres and Taco Pozo , each with about 200 microg As/l in the drinking water , and Rosario de Lerma , with 0.65 microg As/l . Findings show that the concentrations of As in the blood and urine of the children in the two As-rich villages were on average 9 and 380 microg/l , respectively , the highest ever recorded for children . The concentrations were about 10 and 30 times higher for blood and urine , respectively , than in Rosario de Lerma . Total As in urine was only slightly higher than the sum of metabolites of inorganic As ( U-Asmet ) , i.e. , inorganic As , methylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) ; this shows that inorganic As was the main form of As ingested . In contrast to previous studies on urinary metabolites of inorganic As in various population groups , the children and women in the present study excreted very little MMA . Thus , there seems to be a polymorphism for the enzymes ( methyltransferases ) involved in the methylation of As . Interestingly , the children had a significantly higher percentage of inorganic As in urine than the women , about 50% versus 32% . Also , the percentage of inorganic As in the children is considerably higher than in previous studies on children ( about 13% in the two studies available ) and adults ( about 15-25% ) in other population groups . This may indicate that children are more sensitive to As-induced toxicity than adults , as the methylated metabolites bind less to tissue constituents than inorganic As . In the children , the percentage inorganic arsenic in urine decreased , and the percentage of DMA increased with increasing U-Asmet , indicating an induction of As methylation with increasing exposure .	1 122 12 127
23321857	Chlorpyrifos ( CPF ) is applied seasonally in Egypt by adolescent agricultural workers and the extent of occupational exposure and the potential for environmental CPF exposure in this population is poorly understood . Adolescent pesticide applicators ( n=57 ; 12-21 years of age ) and age-matched non-applicators ( n=38 ) from the same villages were followed for 10 months in 2010 , spanning pre-application through post-application . Eight urine and five blood samples were collected from participants within this time period . Blood acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ; exposure/effect biomarker ) and urine 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPy ; exposure biomarker ) were used to assess occupational CPF exposures in pesticide applicators and environmental exposures in non-applicators . Applicators demonstrated significantly higher TCPy concentration and BChE depression than non-applicators throughout CPF application . This difference persisted for 4-7 weeks after the cessation of agricultural spraying . However , both groups exhibited significantly elevated TCPy and depressed BChE , compared with their respective baseline . The peak TCPy levels during the spray season ( 95% confidence interval ( CI) ) for non-applicators and applicators reached 16.8 ( 9.87-28.5 ) and 137 ( 57.4-329)âug/g creatinine , respectively . BChE levels ( 95% CIs ) during the spray were as follows : 1.47 ( 1.28-1.68 ) for non-applicators and 0.47 ( 0.24-0.94)âU/ml for applicators . The longitudinal assessment of CPF biomarkers provided robust measures of exposure and effect throughout CPF application in adolescents and revealed significant exposures in both applicators and non-applicators . Biomarker data in the non-applicators , which mirrored that of the applicators , indicated that non-applicators received environmental CPF exposures . This suggests that similar exposures may occur in other residents of this region during periods of pesticide application .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 127 1112
24263140	Perfluoroalkyl acids ( PFAAs ) are persistent , synthetic compounds that are used in a number of consumer products . Perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) have been associated with cardiovascular risk factors , and changes in gene expression and DNA methylation in animals and cellular systems . However , whether PFAA exposure is associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation , a potential marker of cardiovascular risk , in humans remains unknown . We sought to evaluate the cross-sectional associations between serum PFAAs and LINE-1 DNA methylation in a population highly exposed to PFOA . We measured serum PFAAs twice four to five years apart in 685 adult participants ( 47% male , mean ageÂ±SD=42Â±11years ) . We measured percent LINE-1 DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes at the second time point ( follow-up ) , and estimated absolute differences in LINE-1 methylation associated with an interquartile ( IQR ) shift in mean PFAA serum levels . IQR increases in mean serum PFOA , PFOS , perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) , and perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS ) were associated with differences of -0.04 ( p=0.16 ) , 0.20 ( p=0.001 ) , 0.06 ( p=0.19 ) , and 0.02 ( p=0.57 ) , respectively , in % LINE-1 methylation at follow-up after adjustment for potential confounders . We observed a monotonic increase in LINE-1 DNA methylation across tertiles of PFOS and PFNA ( ptrend=0.02 for both associations ) , but not across tertiles of PFOA or PFHxS ( ptrend=0.71 and 0.44 , respectively ) . In summary , serum PFOS was associated with LINE-1 methylation , while serum PFOA , PFHxS , and PFNA were not . Additional research is needed to more precisely determine whether these compounds are epigenetically active .	11 1111 12 1 122 111
9485480	Environmental pollution with the nephrotoxic metal cadmium is considered a potential health risk for the general population . In 1976 it was reported that the cadmium concentration in human kidney cortex in Sweden had increased in parallel with increasing levels in soil and grain during the twentieth century . Since the cadmium concentration in farming lands is still increasing , the present study was undertaken to further elucidate whether the cadmium concentration in the kidney is still increasing . Kidney cortex biopsies were collected at 171 autopsies of victims to sudden and accidental death during 1995 and 1996 , and the cadmium concentrations were determined and compared with previously published Swedish data obtained from forensic autopsies . The geometric mean cadmium concentration in kidney cortex in subjects 40 years of age and younger was about 40% of the concentration found in the 1970s , while the reduction was less pronounced among older people . The highest individual concentration of cadmium was 41.5 microg/g wet weight ( ww ) . The geometric mean concentration was less than 14 microg/g ww at ages around 50 years of age , when the cadmium concentration in kidney cortex is highest , as compared with approximately 20 microg/g ww in the 1970s . There was also a reduction in cadmium concentrations among nonsmokers ; thus , a decrease in tobacco smoking in Sweden during the last decades is not the only explanation for the reduction of cadmium in the kidney cortex . Other reasons for this reduction could be changes in dietary habits and reduced cadmium contamination from Swedish industries .	1 12 125
23322787	BACKGROUND Arsenic ( III ) methyltransferase ( AS3MT ) has been related to urine arsenic metabolites in association studies . Other genes might also play roles in arsenic metabolism and excretion . OBJECTIVE We evaluated genetic determinants of urine arsenic metabolites in American Indian adults from the Strong Heart Study ( SHS ) . METHODS We evaluated heritability of urine arsenic metabolites [ percent inorganic arsenic ( %iAs ) , percent monomethylarsonate ( %MMA ) , and percent dimethylarsinate ( %DMA) ] in 2,907 SHS participants with urine arsenic measurements and at least one relative within the cohort . We conducted a preliminary linkage analysis in a subset of 487 participants with available genotypes on approximately 400 short tandem repeat markers using a general pedigree variance component approach for localizing quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) . RESULTS The medians ( interquartile ranges ) for %iAs , %MMA , and %DMA were 7.7% ( 5.4-10.7% ) , 13.6% ( 10.5-17.1% ) , and 78.4% ( 72.5-83.1% ) , respectively . The estimated heritability was 53% for %iAs , 50% for %MMA , and 59% for %DMA . After adjustment for sex , age , smoking , body mass index , alcohol consumption , region , and total urine arsenic concentrations , LOD [ logarithm ( to the base of 10 ) of the odds ] scores indicated suggestive evidence for genetic linkage with QTLs influencing urine arsenic metabolites on chromosomes 5 ( LOD = 2.03 for %iAs ) , 9 ( LOD = 2.05 for %iAs and 2.10 for %MMA ) , and 11 ( LOD = 1.94 for %iAs ) . A peak for %DMA on chromosome 10 within 2 Mb of AS3MT had an LOD of 1.80 . CONCLUSIONS This population-based family study in American Indian communities supports a genetic contribution to variation in the distribution of arsenic metabolites in urine and , potentially , the involvement of genes other than AS3MT .	1 12 127
24260455	BACKGROUND We utilized data from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) in Araihazar , Bangladesh , to evaluate the association of steamed rice consumption with urinary total arsenic concentration and arsenical skin lesions in the overall study cohort ( N=18,470 ) and in a subset with available urinary arsenic metabolite data ( N=4,517 ) . METHODS General linear models with standardized beta coefficients were used to estimate associations between steamed rice consumption and urinary total arsenic concentration and urinary arsenic metabolites . Logistic regression models were used to estimate prevalence odds ratios ( ORs ) and their 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for the associations between rice intake and prevalent skin lesions at baseline . Discrete time hazard models were used to estimate discrete time ( HRs ) ratios and their 95% CIs for the associations between rice intake and incident skin lesions . RESULTS Steamed rice consumption was positively associated with creatinine-adjusted urinary total arsenic ( Î²=0.041 , 95% CI : 0.032-0.051 ) and urinary total arsenic with statistical adjustment for creatinine in the model ( Î²=0.043 , 95% CI : 0.032-0.053 ) . Additionally , we observed a significant trend in skin lesion prevalence ( P-trend=0.007 ) and a moderate trend in skin lesion incidence ( P-trend=0.07 ) associated with increased intake of steamed rice . CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that rice intake may be a source of arsenic exposure beyond drinking water .	11 24 12 127 1 2 243 112
15220070	Fish consumption from the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River has been decreasing over the last years due to advisories and increased awareness of the presence of several contaminants . Methylmercury ( MeHg ) , a well-established neurotoxicant even at low levels of exposure , bioaccumulates to differing degrees in various fish species and can have serious adverse effects on the development and functioning of the human central nervous system , especially during prenatal exposure . Most studies on MeHg exposure have focussed on high-level consumers from local fish sources , although mercury ( Hg ) is also present in fresh , frozen , and canned market fish . Moreover , little information exists on the temporal variation of blood and hair Hg in pregnant women , particularly in populations with low levels of Hg . The aim of the present study was to characterize the temporal variation of Hg during pregnancy and to investigate the relation between fish consumption from various sources prior to and during pregnancy and maternal cord blood and mother's hair Hg levels . We recruited 159 pregnant women from Southwest Quebec through two prenatal clinics of the Quebec Public Health System . All women completed two detailed questionnaires concerning their fish consumption ( species and frequency ) prior to and during pregnancy . The women also provided blood samples for all three trimesters of pregnancy and hair samples after delivery of up to 9 cm in length . Blood and hair Hg levels were analyzed by cold-vapor atomic-absorption and -fluorescence spectrometry methods , respectively . Results showed that maternal blood and hair Hg levels decreased significantly between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy . However , cord blood Hg was significantly higher than maternal blood at birth . Maternal hair was correlated with Hg blood concentration and was highly predictive of the organic fraction in cord blood . A strong dose relation was observed between the frequency of fish consumption before and during pregnancy and Hg exposure in mothers and newborns . Fish consumption prior to and during pregnancy explained 26% and 20% of cord blood Hg variance , respectively . For this population , detailed multivariate analyses showed that during pregnancy market fish ( fresh , canned , and frozen ) were more important sources of Hg exposure than were fish from the St. Lawrence River . These results should be taken into account for future advisories and intervention strategies , which should consider Hg levels in different species from all sources in order to maximize the nutritional input from fish and minimize the toxic risk .	24 12 1 122 123 243 2
9600801	Suriname is experiencing a revival of small scale gold mining activities , with about 10,000 to 15,000 workers involved in 1996 . The estimated production in 1995 is at least 10,000 kg crude gold . Gold is extracted with mercury and methods used are comparable with those described for gold mining in the Amazon Basin . Since no data exist on the internal mercury exposure of workers in Suriname a study was performed . A group of mercury-exposed Maroons , who are principally involved in the mining located in the tropical rainforest , is compared with nonexposed Maroons living in a non-gold mining area . Blood and urine samples of both groups were analyzed for total mercury using an atomic absorption spectrometer with an FIAS hydride system . In the study 28 exposed and 17 controls with a comparable mean age ( P=0.544 ; exposed 27+/-7.2 years , n=26 ; controls 26+/-7.7 years , n=17 ) , all males , participated . The urine levels for both groups differ statistically significantly from each other ( P&lt;0.001 ; exposed mean 27.5+/-21.1 microg/g creatinine ; controls mean 5. 2+/-2.9 microg/g creatinine ) . This is , however , not the case with the blood levels ( P=0.036 : exposed mean 18.1+/-11.0 microg/L , n=25 ; controls mean 26.8+/-14.6 microg/L , n=16 ) . In contrast with blood the urine total mercury levels in this study confirm , on a group basis , exposure to mercury as described for individuals working in the gold mining in the Amazon Basin .	1 122 12 127
23333083	Over the last decades many epidemiologic studies considered the morbidity patterns for respiratory diseases and lung function of children in the context of ambient air pollution usually measured in the postnatal period . The main purpose of this study is to assess the impact of prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) on the recurrent broncho-pulmonary infections in early childhood . The study included 214 children who had measurements of personal prenatal PM2.5 exposure and regularly collected data on the occurrence of acute bronchitis and pneumonia diagnosed by a physician from birth over the seven-year follow-up . The effect of prenatal exposure to PM2.5 was adjusted in the multivariable logistic models for potential confounders , such as prenatal and postnatal ETS ( environmental tobacco smoke ) , city residence area as a proxy of postnatal urban exposure , children's sensitization to domestic aeroallergens , and asthma . In the subgroup of children with available PM2.5 indoor levels , the effect of prenatal exposure was additionally adjusted for indoor exposure as well . The adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) for incidence of recurrent broncho-pulmonary infections ( five or more spells of bronchitis and/or pneumonia ) recorded in the follow-up significantly correlated in a dose-response manner with the prenatal PM2.5 level ( OR=2.44 , 95%CI : 1.12-5.36 ) . In conclusion , the study suggests that prenatal exposure to PM2.5 increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and may program respiratory morbidity in early childhood . The study also provides evidence that the target value of 20Î¼g/m(3) for the 24-h mean level of PM2.5 protects unborn babies better than earlier established EPA guidelines .	2 233 232 23
15175172	In this nested case-control study we examined the relationship between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( NHL ) and organochlorine pesticide exposure . We used a data set originally collected between 1969 and 1983 in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Human Adipose Tissue Survey . Adipose samples were randomly collected from cadavers and surgical patients , and levels of organochlorine pesticide residues were determined . From the original study population , 175 NHL cases were identified and matched to 481 controls ; 173 controls were selected from accident victims , and 308 from cases with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction . Cases and controls were mainly from cadavers ( &gt ; 96% ) and were matched on sex , age , region of residence within the United States , and race/ethnicity . Conditional logistic regression showed the organochlorine pesticide residue heptachlor epoxide to be significantly associated with NHL [ compared with the lowest quartile : third quartile odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.82 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.01-3.28 ; fourth quartile OR = 3.41 , 95% CI , 1.89-6.16 ] . The highest quartile level of dieldrin was also associated with elevated NHL risk ( OR = 2.70 ; 95% CI , 1.58-4.61 ) , as were higher levels of oxychlordane , p,p'-DDE [ p,p'-1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene ] , and ss-benzene hexachloride ( ORs = 1.79 , 1.99 , and 2.47 , respectively ) . The p-values for trends for these associations were significant . In models containing pairs of pesticides , only heptachlor epoxide and dieldrin remained significantly associated with risk of NHL . Limitations of this study include collection of samples after diagnosis and a lack of information on variables affecting organochlorine levels such as diet , occupation , and body mass index . Given the persistence of pesticides in the environment , these findings are still relevant today .	1 121 12
23333758	Human biomonitoring studies measuring phthalate metabolites in urine have shown widespread exposure to phthalates in the general population . Diet is thought to be a principle route of exposure to many phthalates . Therefore , we studied urinary phthalate metabolite patterns over a period of strict fasting and additionally recorded personal activity patterns with a diary to investigate non-dietary routes of exposure . Five individuals ( 3 female , 2 male , 27-47 years of age ) fasted on glass-bottled water only over a 48-h period . All urine void events were captured in full , and measured for metabolites of the high molecular weight ( HMW ) di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) , di-isononyl phthalate ( DINP ) and di-isodecyl phthalate ( DiDP ) , and the low molecular weight ( LMW ) di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) , di-iso-butyl phthalate ( DiBP ) , butylbenzyl phthalate ( BBzP ) , dimethyl phthalate ( DMP ) , and diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) . In all , 21 metabolites were measured in a total of 118 urine events , including events before and after the fasting period . At the onset of the study all phthalate metabolite concentrations were consistent with levels found in previous general population studies . Metabolites of the HMW phthalates ( DEHP , DiNP and DiDP ) showed a rapid decline to levels 5-10 times lower than initial levels within 24h of the fast and remained low thereafter . After food consumption resumed , levels rose again . By contrast , metabolites of the LMW phthalates including DMP , DEP , BBzP , DnBP and DiBP showed a cyclical pattern of rising and declining concentrations suggestive of ongoing non-food exposures . Furthermore , metabolites of most of the LMW phthalates ( BBzP , DnBP and DiBP ) tracked each other remarkably well , suggesting concurrent exposures . Diary entries could not help explain exposure sources for these phthalates , with one exception : rises in MEP concentrations around males ' showers suggest personal care products as a major source of DEP . Exposure to HMW phthalates in this cohort appears to be driven by dietary intake , while non-dietary routes such as use of personal care products and ubiquitous sources including dust and indoor air appear to explain exposure to LMW phthalates .	1 2 12 127
24246239	Pooling of surplus serum from individual samples , collected between 2007 and 2009 during Cycle 1 of the Canadian Health Measures Survey ( CHMS ) , was performed to develop a national baseline estimate of brominated flame retardants in Canadians . Serum samples were categorized by sex and distributed by five age groups ranging from 6 to 79years . Nearly 5000 ( 4583 ) serum samples were used to form 59 composite pools . Serum pools were created to ensure a high detection frequency of these analytes in serum because low volume samples had previously resulted in non-detectable concentrations . The analytes of interest in these serum pools included 23 polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and three hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) isomers ( Î±- , Î²- and Î³-HBCD ) . PBDEs were observed in all samples tested and total PBDE concentrations ranged from 27ngg(-1) lipid to 130ngg(-1) lipid ( geometric mean [ GM ] 46ngg(-1) lipid). âPBDE concentrations were significantly elevated in samples representing the 6-11year old age group ( GM 65ngg(-1) lipid ) relative to ages above 40years , although no difference in concentration was observed between the sexes . PBDE concentrations in Canadian sera from the general population were higher than reported in Europe and Asia , but a little lower than observed in the US . PBDE 47 was the greatest contributor to âPBDE concentrations and the GM concentration for this congener was 22ngg(-1) lipid . The other dominant contributors to âPBDE concentrations were in descending order : 153 [ GM 9.4ngg(-1) lipid]&gt;99 [ GM 4.6ngg(-1) lipid]â 100 [ GM 4.1ngg(-1) lipid]&gt;209 [ GM 1.1ngg(-1) lipid ] and 183 [ GM 0.42ngg(-1) lipid]. âHBCD was detected in all samples analysed , although most samples were observed at concentrations &lt;1ngg(-1) lipid , similar to global concentrations. Î±-HBCD was the dominant contributor to âHBCD concentrations in Canadians although Î²- and Î³-HBCD were detected in 23% and 35% of the samples , respectively . No differences in âHBCD concentration were associated with age or sex . This dataset represents the first national data describing HBCD isomers and some PBDEs ( e.g. , 183 , 209 ) in Canadians .	1 122 12
15121520	Phthalates are a group of multifunctional chemicals used in consumer and personal care products , plastics , and medical devices . Laboratory studies show that some phthalates are reproductive and developmental toxicants . Recently , human studies have shown measurable levels of several phthalates in most of the U.S. general population . Despite their widespread use and the consistent toxicologic data on phthalates , information is limited on sources and pathways of human exposure to phthalates . One potential source of exposure is medications . The need for site-specific dosage medications has led to the use of enteric coatings that allow the release of the active ingredients into the small intestine or in the colon . The enteric coatings generally consist of various polymers that contain plasticizers , including triethyl citrate , dibutyl sebacate , and phthalates such as diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) and dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) . In this article we report on medications as a potential source of exposure to DBP in a man who took Asacol [ active ingredient mesalamine ( mesalazine) ] for the treatment of ulcerative colitis . In a spot urine sample from this man collected 3 months after he started taking Asacol , the concentration of monobutyl phthalate , a DBP metabolite , was 16,868 ng/mL ( 6,180 micro g/g creatinine ) . This concentration was more than two orders of magnitude higher than the 95th percentile for males reported in the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) . The patient's urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate ( 443.7 ng/mL , 162.6 micro g/g creatinine ) , mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( 3.0 ng/mL , 1.1 micro g/g creatinine ) , and monobenzyl phthalate ( 9.3 ng/mL , 3.4 micro g/g creatinine ) were unremarkable compared with the NHANES 1999-2000 values . Before this report , the highest estimated human exposure to DBP was more than two orders of magnitude lower than the no observable adverse effect level from animal studies . Further research is necessary to determine the proportional contribution of medications , as well as personal care and consumer products , to a person's total phthalate burden .	24 12 1 244 2 127
24238303	INTRODUCTION Dyslipidemia in children is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and earlier cardiovascular disease development . Environmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) have been shown to be associated with dyslipidemia in adults . However , there are few general population studies examining this association in children or adolescents . In this context , we examined the association between serum PFOA and PFOS levels and dyslipidemia in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents . METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed on 815 participants â©½18years of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2008 . The main outcome was dyslipidemia , defined as total cholesterol &gt;170mg/dL , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) &gt;110mg/dL , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) &lt;40mg/dL or triglycerides &gt;150mg/dL . RESULTS We found that serum PFOA and PFOS were positively associated with high total cholesterol and LDL-C , independent of age , sex , race-ethnicity , body mass index , annual household income , physical activity and serum cotinine levels . Compared to subjects in quartile 1 ( referent ) , the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio ( 95% confidence interval ) for high total cholesterol among children in quartile 4 was 1.16 ( 1.05-2.12 ) for PFOA and 1.53 ( 1.11-1.64 ) for PFOS . PFOA and PFOS were not significantly associated with abnormal HDL-C and triglyceride levels . DISCUSSION Our findings indicate that serum PFOA and PFOS are significantly associated with dyslipidemia in adolescents , even at the lower " background " exposure levels of the US general population .	11 12 1 11121 122 1112 111
9600810	Within a cohort of 1022 consecutive singleton births in the Faroe Islands , we assessed prenatal methylmercury exposure from the maternal hair mercury concentration . At approximately 7 years of age , 917 of the children underwent detailed neurobehavioral examination . Little risk is thought to occur as long as the hair mercury concentration in pregnant women is kept below 10-20 microg/g ( 50-100 nmol/l ) . A case group of 112 children whose mothers had a hair mercury concentration of 10-20 microg/g was therefore matched to children with exposure below 3 microg/g , using age , sex , time of examination , and the mother's score on Raven's Progressive Matrices as matching criteria . The two groups were almost identical with regard to other factors that might affect neurobehavioral performance in this community . On six neuropsychological test measures , the case group showed mild decrements , relative to controls , especially in the domains of motor function , language , and memory . Subtle effects on brain function therefore seem to be detectable at prenatal methylmercury exposure levels currently considered to be safe .	11 1 123 12 112
9600811	Color vision was evaluated in twenty-one mercury exposed workers and referents matched for sex , age , tobacco smoking , and alcohol habits . The Lanthony 15 Hue desaturated panel ( D-15 d ) was applied . In the workers , mean urinary Hg ( HgU ) was 115+/-61.5 microg/g creatinine ; in all but one the values exceeded the biological limit ( BEI ) proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists . A dose-related subclinical color vision impairment was observed in Hg-exposed workers compared to the referents . Just after the survey , working conditions were improved . Twelve months later the workers were reexamined . Mean HgU was 10.0 microg/g creatinine and in no subjects was the BEI exceeded . Color perception was significantly improved compared to the first examination and , furthermore , no differences were observed between exposed workers and referents . The results add evidence that the color vision loss observed during the first part of the study was related to Hg exposure and , moreover , show that this effect is reversible . These data indicate that metallic Hg can induce a reversible impairment in color perception . This suggests that color vision testing should be included in studies on the early effects of Hg . The possibility of applying the D-15 d as an early effect index in the biological monitoring of Hg exposed workers should also be entertained .	11 1 127 12 112
24236202	BACKGROUND Ambient air pollution ( AAP ) may be associated with increased risk for Pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) . The mechanisms underlying this association remain uncertain . OBJECTIVES To determine if real-life exposures to AAP are associated with suppressed IgM antibody responses to P. jirovecii in HIV-infected ( HIV+ ) patients with active PCP , and to determine if AAP , mediated by suppressed serologic responses to Pneumocystis , is associated with adverse clinical outcomes . METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study in HIV+ patients residing in San Francisco and admitted to San Francisco General Hospital with microscopically confirmed PCP . Our AAP predictors were ambient air concentrations of particulate matter of &lt ; 10 Âµm in diameter ( PM10 ) and &lt ; 2.5 Âµm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , ozone ( O3 ) , and sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) measured immediately prior to hospital admission and 2 weeks prior to admission . Our primary outcomes were the IgM serologic responses to four recombinant P. jirovecii major surface glycoprotein ( Msg ) constructs : MsgC1 , MsgC3 , MsgC8 , and MsgC9 . RESULTS Elevated PM10 and NO2 exposures immediately prior to and two weeks prior to hospital admission were associated with decreased IgM antibody responses to P. jirovecii Msg . For exposures immediately prior to admission , every 10 Âµg/m(3) increase in PM10 was associated with a 25 to 35% decrease in IgM responses to Msg ( statistically significant for all the Msg constructs ) , and every 10 ppb increase in NO2 was associated with a 19-45% decrease in IgM responses to Msg ( statistically significant for MsgC8 and MsgC9 ) . Similar findings were seen with exposures two weeks prior to admission , but for fewer of the Msg constructs . CONCLUSIONS Real life exposures to PM10 and NO2 were associated with suppressed IgM responses to P. jirovecii Msg in HIV+ patients admitted with PCP , suggesting a mechanism of immunotoxicity by which AAP increases host susceptibility to pulmonary infection .	11 23 231 1 11123 111 2 1112
15091293	This study analyzes the relationship between arsenic exposure through drinking water and bladder cancer mortality . The county-specific white male bladder cancer mortality data ( 1950-1979 ) and county-specific groundwater arsenic concentration data were obtained for 133 U.S. counties known to be exclusively dependent on groundwater for their public drinking water supply . No arsenic-related increase in bladder cancer mortality was found over the exposure range of 3 to 60 microg/L using stratified analysis and regression analyses ( both unweighted and weighted by county population and using both mean and median arsenic concentrations ) . These results , which provide a direct estimate of arsenic-related cancer risk for U.S. residents , exclude the National Research Council's 2001 risk estimate that was based on Southwest Taiwan data and required adjusting for differences between the body mass and water consumption rates of U.S. and Taiwanese residents .	24 2 241
24231411	Epidemiological studies have shown associations between ambient air pollution and changes in heart rate variability ( HRV ) . However , studies using personal air pollution measurements , especially with exposure averages &lt;24h , are still rare . Between February and March 2008 HRV data as well as personal exposure to particulate matter &lt;2.5Î¼m ( PM2.5 ) , and particle number concentrations ( PNC ) were collected in five volunteers for up to 8.3h on a 5min resolution . Information about the participant's whereabouts was also collected . Mixed models were used to analyze concurrent and up to 30min delayed effects of air pollutants as well as being in traffic on 5min-averages of heart rate ( HR ) , high and low frequency power ( HF and LF ) , standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals ( SDNN ) , and the root mean square of successive interval differences ( RMSSD ) . Results are presented as %-change from the mean per increase in interquartile range of air pollutant . In total , 474 5-min segments were available for analysis . We observed concurrent and delayed reductions in SDNN of about 0.8-1.0% in association with a 5.4Î¼g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 . However , being in traffic by car led to an increase of about 20% 10-14min and 15-19min later . An increase in PM2.5 or PNC was associated with lagged decreases for RMSSD and HF . We detected concurrent reductions in RMSSD ( -17.6% [ 95%-confidence interval : 29.1 ; -4.3] ) when being in traffic by bike/foot . Being in traffic by car was associated with an immediate reduction in LF while more delayed increases in LF were observed when being in traffic by bike/foot . Air pollution and traffic effects on HR were less consistent . These rapid changes in HRV within 30min might be mediated by the autonomic nervous system in response to direct reflexes from receptors in the lungs .	11 23 1 2 112 233
24225723	BACKGROUND Particulate matter and proximity to large roadways may promote disease mechanisms , including systemic inflammation , hormonal alteration , and vascular proliferation , that may contribute to the development and severity of endometriosis . OBJECTIVE Our goal was to determine the association of air pollution exposures during adulthood , including distance to road , particulate matter&lt;2.5 Î¼m , between 2.5 and 10 Î¼m , and &lt;10 Î¼m , ( PM2.5 , PM10-2.5 , PM10 ) , and timing of exposure with risk of endometriosis in the Nurses ' Health Study II . METHODS Proximity to major roadways and outdoor levels of PM2.5 , PM10-2.5 , and PM10 were determined for all residential addresses from 1993 to 2007 . Multivariable-adjusted time-varying Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the relation between these air pollution exposures and endometriosis risk . RESULTS Among 84,060 women , 2,486 incident cases of surgically confirmed endometriosis were identified over 710,230 person-years of follow-up . There was no evidence of an association between endometriosis risk and distance to road or exposure to PM2.5 , PM10-2.5 , or PM10 averaged over follow-up or during the previous 2- or 4-year period . CONCLUSIONS Traffic and air pollution exposures during adulthood were not associated with incident endometriosis in this cohort of women .	2 231 23
23349674	The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is increasing worldwide and diverse environmental and genetic risk factors are well recognized . Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the calpain-10 gene ( CAPN-10 ) , which encodes a protein involved in the secretion and action of insulin , and chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) through drinking water have been independently associated with an increase in the risk for T2DM . In the present work we evaluated if CAPN-10 SNPs and iAs exposure jointly contribute to the outcome of T2DM . Insulin secretion ( beta-cell function ) and insulin sensitivity were evaluated indirectly through validated indexes ( HOMA2 ) in subjects with and without T2DM who have been exposed to a gradient of iAs in their drinking water in northern Mexico . The results were analyzed taking into account the presence of the risk factor SNPs SNP-43 and -44 in CAPN-10 . Subjects with T2DM had significantly lower beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity . An inverse association was found between beta-cell function and iAs exposure , the association being more pronounced in subjects with T2DM . Subjects without T2DM who were carriers of the at-risk genotype SNP-43 or -44 , also had significantly lower beta-cell function . The association of SNP-43 with beta-cell function was dependent on iAs exposure , age , gender and BMI , whereas the association with SNP-44 was independent of all of these factors . Chronic exposure to iAs seems to be a risk factor for T2DM in humans through the reduction of beta-cell function , with an enhanced effect seen in the presence of the at-risk genotype of SNP-43 in CAPN-10 . Carriers of CAPN-10 SNP-44 have also shown reduced beta-cell function .	11 24 1 2 241 112
22901373	BACKGROUND The study was carried out in order to respond to public concern on the occupational exposure of metallurgical workers to highly toxic PCDDs , PCDFs , and PCBs in the area of the city of Brescia , northern Italy . OBJECTIVES The study investigated the effects on the haematic burden of occupational exposures to the aforesaid contaminants in different work environments , attempting to establish causal relationships and providing indications for occupational health preventive measures . METHODS Chemical concentrations were measured in blood serum of " professionally exposed " ( PE ) and " not professionally exposed " ( NPE ) subjects . NPE subjects included industrial administrative employees , Brescia inhabitants , and remote rural people . RESULTS The central tendency indexes of contaminant cumulative concentrations were higher in PE than in NPE samples ( for the mean values : PCDDs+PCDFs , 22.9 vs. 19.5 pgWHO-TEQ(1997)/g lb ; DL-PCBs , 26.0 vs. 23.6 pgWHO-TEQ(1997)/g lb ; PCDDs+PCDFs+DL-PCBs ( TEQ(TOT) ) , 48.9 vs. 43.1 pgWHO-TEQ(1997)/g lb ; Î£(6)[NDL-PCBs] , 427 vs. 401 ng g(-1)lb ) ; however , no statistical differences were detected at P=0.05 . A significant difference for PCDDs+PCDFs and TEQ(TOT) was observed as the NPE data were progressively reduced to those of the remote rural people . The existence of a differential occupational exposure due to different environments was detected by applying the factor analysis to congener-specific data ( analytical profiles ) . CONCLUSIONS Findings indicate that metallurgical workers may be exposed to PCDD , PCDF , and PCB more than the general population , in particular due to non-negligible contributions to exposure from workplace ambient air . Findings also suggest that an improvement of preventive measures may be required to avoid chemical overexposure in certain metallurgical workplaces . To identify exposure groups , the DL- and NDL-PCB analytical profiles seemed to be more sensitive to environmental exposure sources/pathways than those of PCDDs and PCDFs .	1 122 12
24213019	Background : Epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 and hospital admissions . The chemical composition of particles varies across locations and time periods . Identifying the most harmful constituents and sources is an important health and regulatory concern.Objectives : We examined pollutant sources for associations with risk of hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory causes.Methods : We obtained PM2.5 filter samples for four counties in Connecticut and Massachusetts and analyzed them for PM2.5 elements . Source apportionment was used to estimate daily PM2.5 contributions from sources ( traffic , road dust , oil combustion , and sea salt as well as a regional source representing coal combustion and other sources ) . Associations between daily PM2.5 constituents and sources and risk of cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations for the Medicare population ( &gt ; 333,000 persons â¥ 65 years of age ) were estimated with time-series analyses ( August 2000-February 2004).Results : PM2.5 total mass and PM2.5 road dust contribution were associated with cardiovascular hospitalizations , as were the PM2.5 constituents calcium , black carbon , vanadium , and zinc . For respiratory hospitalizations , associations were observed with PM2.5 road dust , and sea salt as well as aluminum , calcium , chlorine , black carbon , nickel , silicon , titanium , and vanadium . Effect estimates were generally robust to adjustment by co-pollutants of other constituents . An interquartile range increase in same-day PM2.5 road dust ( 1.71 Î¼g/m3 ) was associated with a 2.11% ( 95% CI : 1.09 , 3.15% ) and 3.47% ( 95% CI : 2.03 , 4.94% ) increase in cardiovascular and respiratory admissions , respectively.Conclusions : Our results suggest some particle sources and constituents are more harmful than others and that in this Connecticut/Massachusetts region the most harmful particles include black carbon , calcium , and road dust PM2.5.Citation : Bell ML , Ebisu K , Leaderer BP , Gent JF , Lee HJ , Koutrakis P , Wang Y , Dominici F , Peng RD. 2014 .

14769642	Studies have found increased bladder cancer risks associated with high levels of arsenic in drinking water , but little information exists about risks at lower concentrations . Ecologic studies in Argentina have found increased bladder cancer mortality in CÃ³rdoba Province , where some wells are contaminated with moderate arsenic concentrations . This population-based bladder cancer case-control study in two CÃ³rdoba counties recruited 114 case-control pairs , matched on age , sex , and county , during 1996-2000 . Water samples , particularly from wells , were obtained from subjects ' current residences and residences in the last 40 years . Statistical analyses showed no evidence of associations with exposure estimates based on arsenic concentrations in drinking water . However , when well-water consumption per se was used as the exposure measure , time-window analyses suggested that use of well water more than 50 years before interview was associated with increased bladder cancer risk . This association was limited to ever smokers ( odds ratio = 2.5 , 95% confidence interval : 1.1 , 5.5 for 51-70 years before interview ) , and the possibility that this association is due to chance cannot be excluded . This study suggests lower bladder cancer risks for arsenic than predicted from other studies but adds to evidence that the latency for arsenic-induced bladder cancers may be longer than previously thought .	24 2 241
14754576	We performed a risk assessment of metal exposure to population subgroups living on , and growing food on , urban sites . We modeled uptake of cadmium , copper , nickel , lead , and zinc for a selection of commonly grown allotment and garden vegetables . Generalized linear cross-validation showed that final predictions of Cd , Cu , Ni , and Zn content of food crops were satisfactory , whereas the Pb uptake models were less robust . We used predicted concentrations of metals in the vegetables to assess the risk of exposure to human populations from homegrown food sources . Risks from other exposure pathways ( consumption of commercially produced foodstuffs , dust inhalation , and soil ingestion ) were also estimated . These models were applied to a geochemical database of an urban conurbation in the West Midlands , United Kingdom . Risk , defined as a " hazard index, " was mapped for three population subgroups : average person , highly exposed person , and the highly exposed infant ( assumed to be a 2-year-old child ) . The results showed that food grown on 92% of the urban area presented minimal risk to the average person subgroup . However , more vulnerable population subgroups ( highly exposed person and the highly exposed infant ) were subject to hazard index values greater than unity . This study highlights the importance of site-specific risk assessment and the " suitable for use " approach to urban redevelopment .	24 23 245 2 243 242
9676702	The objective of this study was to assess whether arsenic exposure is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus as indicated in a few earlier studies . Arsenic in drinking water is known to occur in western Bangladesh , and in 1996 , two of the authors conducted a survey of the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among 163 subjects with keratosis taken as exposed to arsenic and 854 unexposed individuals . Diabetes mellitus was determined by history of symptoms , previously diagnosed diabetes , glucosuria , and blood sugar level after glucose intake . The crude prevalence ratio for diabetes mellitus among keratotic subjects exposed to arsenic was 4.4 ( 95% confidence interval 2.5-7.7 ) and increased to 5.2 ( 95% confidence interval 2.5-10.5 ) after adjustment for age , sex , and body mass index . On the basis of a few earlier measurements of arsenic concentrations in drinking water by the authorities in Bangladesh and another 20 new ad hoc analyses , approximate time-weighted exposure levels to arsenic in drinking water could be estimated for each subject . Three time-weighted average exposure categories were created , i.e. , less than 0.5 , 0.5-1.0 , and more than 1.0 mg/liter . For the unexposed subjects , the corresponding prevalence ratios were 1.0 , 2.6 , 3.9 , and 8.8 , representing a significant trend in risk ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) . The result corroborates earlier studies and suggests that arsenic exposure is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus .	11 24 1 11122 2 241 111 1112
9681980	As a consequence of contamination by effluents from local electronics manufacturing facilities , the New Bedford Harbor and estuary in southeastern Massachusetts is among the sites in the United States that are considered the most highly contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) . Since 1993 , measures of intrauterine PCB exposure have been obtained for a sample of New Bedford area infants . Among 122 mother-infant pairs , we identified four milk samples with total PCB levels that were significantly higher than the rest , with estimated total PCBs ranging from 1,100 to 2,400 ng/g milk fat compared with an overall mean of 320 ng/g milk fat for the 122 women . The congener profile and history of one case was consistent with past occupational PCB exposures . Otherwise , the source of PCB exposures in these cases was difficult to specify . Environmental exposures including those from fish consumption were likely , whereas residence adjacent to a PCB-contaminated site was considered an unlikely exposure source . In all four cases , the infants were full-term , healthy newborns . Because the developing nervous system is believed to be particularly susceptible to PCBs ( for example , prenatal PCB exposures have been associated with prematurity , decrements in birth weight and gestation time , and behavioral and developmental deficits in later infancy and childhood , including decrements in IQ ) , it is critical to ascertain if breast-feeding is a health risk for the women's infants . Despite the potential for large postnatal PCB exposures via breast milk , there is limited evidence of significant developmental toxicity associated with the transmission of moderate PCB concentrations through breast milk . Breast-feeding is associated with substantial health benefits including better cognitive skills among breast-fed compared with formula-fed infants . We conclude , based on evidence from other studies , that the benefits of breast-feeding probably outweigh any risk from PCB exposures via breast milk among the four New Bedford infants . In this case report , PCB analysis of breast milk and infant cord serum was a research tool . PCB analysis of milk is rarely done clinically , in part because it is difficult to use the results of such analyses to predict health risks . Substantial effort is needed to achieve a better understanding of the clinical and public health significance of PCB exposures , particularly among potentially susceptible groups such as infants and children . Such efforts are critical to improving the clinical and public health management of widespread and ongoing population exposures to PCBs .	1 122 12 124
14664859	Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are a mixture of 209 possible congeners with different chlorine substitutions and they are potentially hazardous compounds in the environment for human beings . The high lipophilicity and the resistance to biodegradation of PCBs allow the bioaccumulation of these chemicals in the fatty tissues of organisms . The objective of this study was to determine the levels of PCBs in the adipose tissue of women living in Ankara , Turkey . For this purpose , levels of seven major persistent PCB congeners ( IUPAC Numbers : 28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 180 ) were measured in 29 primiparous mothers ' adipose tissue samples by gas chromatography with electron capture detection ( GC-ECD ) . PCB IUPAC numbers 138 , 153 and 180 were the most abundant congeners , each accounting for &gt ; 20% of the total PCB content of adipose tissue . PCB 153 was the dominant congener in all the samples ( 141.7 +/- 132.3 ng/g lipid wt. basis ) . The results are compared with the similar studies from other countries . The concentrations of PCB 28 , PCB 52 and PCB 101 were found to be higher than those found in industrialized countries . This study is important in terms of being the first study of determination of PCB levels in adipose tissue samples in Turkey .	1 121 12
14659948	Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins , dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are recognized environmental endocrine disruptors , which are environmentally persistent and may bio-accumulate in human bodies . Pregnant and nursing women may pass these pollutants to their babies both trans-placentally and lactationally . We measured and examined correlations of the levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in perinatal venous serum , placenta , umbilical-cord serum ( representing prenatal exposure ) , and breast milk ( postnatal exposure ) . Subjects included pregnant women without clinical complication between the ages of 25 and 35 , who delivered their babies during 2000.12.01 and 2001.11.30 in central Taiwan . A total of 20 participants were randomly selected from those provided the four biological specimens for analysis of 17 PCDD/Fs , and 12 dioxin-like PCBs and six indicator PCBs using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry . Higher PCDD/F levels were found in placenta ( 10.3 TEq-pg/g lipid ) and venous serum ( 9.1 TEq-pg/g lipid ) compared to those in breast milk ( 7.6 TEq-pg/g lipid ) . Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses showed well association of PCDD/F and PCB levels between different specimens . The total dioxin/PCB level in milk , venous and cord serum can be well predicted by that in placenta through regression functions . This first study of multi-specimen correlation further established rather consistent ratios of these chemical concentrations in various specimens relative to those in venous serum .	1 122 12 124 126
23394848	In the study presented here , we evaluated the exposure of the German population aged 14-80 years to bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) from consumption of food by means of deterministic and probabilistic estimations . The study was performed on the basis of an extensive review of literature from around the world reporting measured data on DEHP in food , as well as official German food control data . Only data from individual measurements were considered and used for fitting of distributions . A wide range of concentrations in non-representative samples are reported in the literature . On the basis of the available DEHP concentration data , 37 food categories were characterized which covered all major food classes . Food consumption data were taken from the diet history interviews of the German National Nutrition Survey II ( Nationale Verzehrsstudie II ) which was performed in 2005/2006 in a representative study population of 15,371 and is the most recent data source of this kind in Germany . Average DEHP intake was estimated deterministically using data on measured concentrations in food ( medians and means ) and food consumption ( means ) . A total dietary exposure to DEHP of 3.6 ( median based ) and 9.3Î¼g/kg of BW per day ( based on mean values ) was estimated deterministically . In addition , distributions of both concentrations and consumption figures were fitted using the @RISK best fit tool for further probabilistic estimations . This approach resulted in estimates within the same range : the estimated median DEHP intake in the whole population ( both non-consumers and consumers of the foods considered ) was 10.2 , the arithmetic mean 14.0 and the 95th percentile 28.6Î¼g/kg of BW per day . The respective estimates for consumers only were 12.4 , 18.7 and 36.5Î¼g/kg of BW per day . These results demonstrate that the probabilistic approach is able to estimate broader ranges of exposure even when using data representing an average intake . Moreover , it reflects the uncertainties of the estimation due to insufficient analytical data on concentrations of DEHP in food .	24 2 243
9728641	CONTEXT Human neurodevelopmental consequences of exposure to methyl-mercury ( MeHg ) from eating fish remain a question of public health concern . OBJECTIVE To study the association between MeHg exposure and the developmental outcomes of children in the Republic of Seychelles at 66 months of age . DESIGN A prospective longitudinal cohort study . PARTICIPANTS A total of 711 of 779 cohort mother-child pairs initially enrolled in the Seychelles Child Development Study in 1989 . SETTING The Republic of Seychelles , an archipelago in the Indian Ocean where 85% of the population consumes ocean fish daily . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prenatal and postnatal MeHg exposure and 6 age-appropriate neurodevelopmental tests : the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities , the Preschool Language Scale , the Woodcock-Johnson Applied Problems and Letter and Word Recognition Tests of Achievement , the Bender Gestalt test , and the Child Behavior Checklist . RESULTS The mean maternal hair total mercury level was 6.8 ppm and the mean child hair total mercury level at age 66 months was 6.5 ppm . No adverse outcomes at 66 months were associated with either prenatal or postnatal MeHg exposure . CONCLUSION In the population studied , consumption of a diet high in ocean fish appears to pose no threat to developmental outcomes through 66 months of age .	11 1 123 12 112
24184045	A sampling campaign from 21 sites in Italy was carried out to investigate the presence of organochlorine pesticide residues in different fish species . Samples came from marine fishery and either from sea- or freshwater aquaculture . Fish feed used in some fish farms were also analyzed . Pesticides studied belong to Persistent Organic Pollutants widely used in the past such as DDT , chlordane , heptachlor , and others . To ensure good quality results and proper data validation the main existing guidelines in the field were applied . The instrumental technique was a Dual column-Dual detector Gas Chromatography ( GC-ECD and Ion Trap GC-MS ) which allowed that complementary data on the same sample were acquired . Results for fishery showed a wide range of concentrations depending from the area and species examined . DDT , the major OC pesticide detected , varied from 0.02 to 130.03 ng g(-1) edible portion . As regards the products of aquaculture we observed slightly lower average levels of pollutants in a more narrow range of concentration : this is probably due to fish feed used as shown by some measures performed in the present study . Organochlorine pesticide residues were detected in all samples examined but they were generally well below the existing tolerance or action levels . Also the estimated daily intakes are well below than those recommended by WHO . This is a good indication about OCPs in the areas investigated but some further considerations on fish safety must be taken into account . An example on how fishes may act as bioindicators is reported .	24 2 243
24184043	Traffic-related volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) pollution has frequently been demonstrated to be a serious problem in the developing countries . Benzene and 1,3-butadiene ( BD ) have been classified as a human carcinogen based on evidence for an increased genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects in both occupational exposure assessment and in vivo/in vitro studies . We have undertaken a biomonitoring of 25 traffic policemen and 23 office policemen in Beirut , through personal air monitoring , assessed by diffusive samplers , as well as through the use of biomarkers of exposure to benzene and BD . Personal benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , and xylene ( BTEX ) exposure were quantified by GC-MS/MS , urinary trans , trans-muconic acid ( t,t-MA ) by HPLC/UV , S-phenyl mercapturic acid ( S-PMA ) , monohydroxy-butenyl mercapturic acid ( MHBMA ) and dihydroxybutyl mercapturic acid ( DHBMA ) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry ( UPLC/ESI(-)-MS/MS ) in MRM ( Multiple Reaction Monitoring ) mode . We found that individual exposure to benzene in the traffic policemen was higher than that measured in traffic policemen in Prague , in Bologna , in Ioannina and in Bangkok. t,t-MA levels could distinguish between office and traffic policemen . However , median MHBMA levels in traffic policemen were slightly elevated , though not significantly higher than in office policemen . Alternatively , DHBMA concentrations could significantly distinguish between office and traffic policemen and showed a better correlation with personal total BTEX exposure . DHMBA , measured in the post-shift urine samples , correlated with both pre-shift MHMBA and pre-shift DHMBA . Moreover , there was not a marked effect of smoking habits on DHBMA . Taken together , these findings suggested that DHBMA is more suitable than MHBMA as biomarker of exposure to BD in humans . Traffic policemen , who are exposed to benzene and BD at the roadside in central Beirut , are potentially at a higher risk for development of diseases such as cancer than office policemen .	12 23 1 2 127 233
9787848	This study describes the exposure of coke plant workers to hydrocarbons . Aromatic hydrocarbons ( AHs ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) in the breathing zone air and their oxygenated metabolites in the urine of coke plant workers are qualitatively and quantitatively determined . Concentrations of benzene , toluene , naphthalene , m + p-xylene , o-xylene and 14 different PAHs were measured at the different workplaces by personal air sampling . O-cresol , 1- and 2-naphthol , methylhippuric acid , and 1-hydroxypyrene were determined in hydrolyzed urine of workers collected after the work shift . The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) method was applied to identify AHs in air and in urine samples . Time-weighted values of exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons at a coke plant were : benzene ( 0.06-9.82 mg/m3 ) , toluene ( 0.05-4.71 mg/m3 ) , naphthalene ( 0.01-3.28 mg/m3 ) , o-xylene ( 0.01-1.76 mg/m3 ) and m + p-xylene ( 0.01-2.62 mg/m3 ) . At the coke batteries , the total concentration of PAHs ranged from 7.27 to 21.92 micrograms/m3 . At the sorting department , the total concentration of PAHs were about half this value . Concentration of the urinary metabolites ( naphthols and methylhippuric acid ) detected in workers at the tar distillation department are three times higher than those for the coke batteries and sorting department workers . A correlation between inhaled toluene , naphthalene , xylene , and urinary excretion of metabolites has been found . Time-weighted average concentrations of AHs in the breathing zone air show that exposure levels of the workers are rather low in comparison to exposure limits . The 1-hydroxypyrene concentration is below 24.75 mumol/mol creatinine . The GC/MS analysis reveals the presence of AHs , mainly benzene and naphthalene homologues . It has been found that coke plant workers are simultaneously exposed to the mixture of aromatic and polycyclic hydrocarbons present in the breathing zone air of a coke plant . Exposure levels are significantly influenced by job categories . Compounds identified in the urine appear to be the products of the hydroxylation of AHs present in the air as well as unmetabolized hydrocarbons .	12 23 1 2 127 233
23410587	In this study , the reference level of cadmium in urine and blood related with bone damage was assessed using benchmark dose in a Chinese female population . Total of 338 women was recruited , and urine and blood samples were collected from each individual for determination of cadmium in urine ( UCd ) and blood ( BCd ) . Bone mineral density was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry . BMD and BMDL were calculated corresponding to additional risk of 5% and 10% . With benchmark response ( BMR ) of 5%/10% , the BMD of BCd , UCd related with osteoporosis was 1.88Î¼g/L/3.23Î¼g/L and 5.30Î¼g/g crea/9.06Î¼g/g crea , and the BMDL-05 was 1.39Î¼g/L/2.38Î¼g/L and 3.78Î¼g/g crea/6.36Î¼g/g crea ; the BMD of BCd , UCd related with low bone mass was 0.95Î¼g/L/3.12Î¼g/L and 3.12Î¼g/g crea/5.87Î¼g/g crea , and the BMDL-05 was 0.72Î¼g/L/1.35Î¼g/L and 2.14Î¼g/g crea/3.99Î¼g/g crea . The BMD of UCd in people over 60years old was much lower than that of people less than 60years old . BMD value was related with ages and effects biomarkers . Our data showed that BMD of UCd associated with osteoporosis was lower than that previously estimated .	11 12 112 1 122 127
24169876	Individuals spend â¼90% of their time indoors in proximity to sources of particulate and gaseous air pollutants . The sulfur tracer method was used to separate indoor concentrations of particulate matter ( PM ) PM2.5 mass , elements and thermally resolved carbon fractions by origin in New York City residences of asthmatic children . Enrichment factors relative to sulfur concentrations were used to rank species according to the importance of their indoor sources . Mixed effects models were used to identify building characteristics and resident activities that contributed to observed concentrations . Significant indoor sources were detected for OC1 , Cl , K and most remaining OC fractions . We attributed 46% of indoor PM2.5 mass to indoor sources related to OC generation indoors . These sources include cooking ( NO2 , Si , Cl , K , OC4 and OP ) , cleaning ( most OC fractions ) , candle/incense burning ( black carbon , BC ) and smoking ( K , OC1 , OC3 and EC1 ) . Outdoor sources accounted for 28% of indoor PM2.5 mass , mainly photochemical reaction products , metals and combustion products ( EC , EC2 , Br , Mn , Pb , Ni , Ti , V and S ) . Other indoor sources accounted for 26% and included re-suspension of crustal elements ( Al , Zn , Fe , Si and Ca ) . Indoor sources accounted for â¼72% of PM2.5 mass and likely contributed to differences in the composition of indoor and outdoor PM2.5 exposures.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication , 30 October 2013 ; doi:10.1038/jes.2013.74 .	2 232 23
23411084	Mercury ( Hg ) is a ubiquitous heavy metal that can negatively affect human health ; however , few studies have examined the impact of prenatal low-level Hg exposure on fetal growth . We investigated prenatal exposure levels of Hg and the relationship between Hg levels and neonatal anthropometrics , including birth weight , length , and head circumference . A total of 258 mother-infant pairs were recruited from a rural community located on the southern coastal area of Laizhou Bay of the Bohai Sea in northern China between September 2010 and December 2011 . We measured maternal and cord whole blood Hg levels and examined their association with neonatal anthropometrics . The geometric means ( GMs ) of Hg in maternal and cord whole blood were 0.84Î¼gL(-1) and 1.46Î¼gL(-1) , respectively . The Hg exposure levels in our study population were much lower than those reported in previous domestic studies . No significant associations were found between maternal or cord blood Hg levels and birth weight , length , and head circumference . However , our results should be interpreted with caution given the high toxicity of Hg and its persistence in the body . Studies focusing on long-term adverse outcomes are needed to further examine the cumulative effects of low-level Hg exposure .	11 1 122 12 112
12387304	The aim of this paper is to estimate the levels of arsenic ( As ) ingestion through cooked foods consumed in an arsenic endemic area and the assessment of their dietary intake of As . The study was conducted in two villages : a population chronically exposed to a high concentration of As via drinking water ( 410+/-35 microg/l ) and to a low-exposure group ( 12+/-4 microg/l ) . A 24-h dietary recall questionnaire was applied to about 25 adult participants in each community . Samples of cooked food , ready for intake , were collected separately from each family's participants . To obtain the As estimate for each food item consumed , the mean quantity of food ingested in grams ( wet weight ) was calculated and the concentrations of total arsenic ( TAs ) in each cooked food were determined . The estimations of TAs intake were based on the sum over mean of As ingested from each food item consumed during the 24-h period for each participant . For the estimation of total daily As intake , we summed the mean obtained from food , plain water and hot beverage intakes . The TAs average intakes calculated for low-As-exposure group were 0.94 and 0.76 microg/kg body weight/day , for both summer and winter exposure scenarios , respectively . These values are 44.7 and 36% of the provisional tolerable daily intake ( PTDI ) for inorganic arsenic ( 2.14 microg/kg body weight/day ) , established by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in 1989 . The WHO reference value was obtained on a weekly basis intake estimation assuming an average body weight of 68 kg in adults . In contrast , for the high-exposure group the TAs average intakes were 16.6 and 12.3 microg/kg body weight/day for summer and winter , respectively . Ingestion via cooked food represented 32.5 and 43.9% of the total daily As intake in the high-exposure group ; for summer and winter , respectively . None the less , the bioavailability of As through food can be different than via drinking water .	24 2 241 243
23416249	BACKGROUND International studies suggest that low dose prenatal methylmercury exposure ( &gt;29 nmol/L ) has long-term adverse neurocognitive effects . There is evidence that the majority of children in Hong Kong exceed this level as a result of high fish consumption of mothers during pregnancy . OBJECTIVE To study whether there are any associations between low-dose prenatal methylmercury exposure and neurocognitive outcomes in Hong Kong children . MATERIALS AND METHODS All 1057 children from the original birth cohort were eligible for entry into the study , except children with conditions that would affect neurocognitive development , but were unrelated to methylmercury exposure . Subjects were assessed by a wide panel of tests covering a broad range of neurocognitive functions : Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ( HK-WISC ) , Hong Kong List Learning Test ( HKLLT ) , Tests of Everyday Attention for Children ( TEACH ) , Boston Naming Test , and Grooved Pegboard Test . RESULTS 608 subjects were recruited ( median age 8.2 years , IQR 7.3 , 8.8 ; 53.9% boys ) . After correction by confounders including child age and sex , multivariate analysis showed that cord blood mercury concentration was significantly associated with three subtests : Picture Arrangement of HK-WISC ( coefficient -0.944 , P=0.049 ) and Short and Long Delay Recall Difference of the HKLLT ( coefficient -1.087 , P=0.007 and coefficient -1.161 , P=0.005 , respectively ) , i.e. , performance worsened with increasing prenatal methylmercury exposure in these subtests . CONCLUSIONS Small , but statistically significant adverse associations between prenatal methylmercury exposure and long-term neurocognitive effects ( a visual sequencing task and retention ability of verbal memory ) were found in our study . These effects are compatible with findings of studies with higher prenatal methylmercury exposure levels and suggest that safe strategies to further reduce exposure levels in Hong Kong are desirable .	11 1 122 12 112
24161446	The role of phthalate exposure at different stages in the immune system and atopic disorders is not well-known . This study aims to evaluate the effects of prenatal and postnatal phthalate exposures on immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) levels and atopic dermatitis ( AD ) in children by objective biomarkers . We conducted a prospective Taiwan Birth Panel cohort study with 483 mother/infant pairs . Finally , 161 urine specimens at 3rd trimester of pregnancy , 219 urine specimens from children at age 2 , and 192 urine specimens at age 5 were analyzed after excluding missing data and loss to follow-up . Urine monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , monobutyl phthalate ( MBP ) , monobenzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) , and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) at 3rd trimester of pregnancy and at ages 2 and 5 were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry . At ages 2 and 5 , information on the development of AD and serum total IgE was collected . The association between urine phthalate metabolite levels at different stages and serum IgE and AD was evaluated by multivariate linear regression and logistic regression . Urine phthalate metabolite levels were higher at age 2 than those at pregnancy and age 5 . At each period , urine MBP levels were higher than MEP , MEHP , and MBzP . MEHP levels at age 2 positively correlated with serum IgE levels ( per ln-unit : Î²=0.191 , p=0.02 ) . Analyses stratified by gender revealed that MEHP levels positively correlated with serum IgE levels only in boys ( per ln-unit : Î²=0.256 , p=0.03 ) . When dividing into quartiles , urine MBzP levels at age 2 had a significant association with AD . We found no statistically significant association of other phthalate metabolites with IgE and AD . Early life phthalate exposure may increase the risk of allergic sensitization and atopic disorders .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
9828296	A survey was undertaken of PCB and PCDD/DF congeners in eggs and poultry meat from a smallholding close to a chemical waste incinerator , other sites in the surrounding district , and three rural locations . The concentrations from the site close to the incinerator were appreciably greater than those found elsewhere , although the contrast was less marked for poultry meat than eggs . All types of poultry produce displayed noticeable variations in congener composition when the samples were grouped according to geographical origin . These results support the view that the environment in which poultry live does influence the PCB and PCDD/DF characteristics of their products . Exposure calculations indicated that consumption of eggs from the site close to the incinerator would constitute a substantial proportion of recommended daily intakes for such contaminants and at the present time these products are not being eaten .	24 2 243
12222782	Dioxins including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) are highly toxic . Even at environmental pollution levels , they cause hormonal damage in women , and they have been shown to induce immunosuppression and genital function damage in humans . In this study , a new method using isotope dilution was established to detect PCDDs , PCDFs and Co-PCBs in human hair . This method , comprised of washing and cutting of hair , alkaline decomposition , hexane extraction , multilayer silica gel column chromatography , high performance liquid chromatography with a porous graphite carbon column and analysis by high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry , enabled us to analyze PCDDs , PCDFs and Co-PCBs at trace levels of less than pg/g with good reproducibility . In addition , there was a correlation between some isomers in human hair and blood collected from identical donors . Human hair analysis is useful to evaluate human risk assessment including that due to environmental pollution .	1 12 122 123
24161445	BACKGROUND Phthalate contamination exists in the North Coast karst aquifer system in Puerto Rico . In light of potential health impacts associated with phthalate exposure , targeted action for elimination of exposure sources may be warranted , especially for sensitive populations such as pregnant women . However , information on exposure to phthalates from a variety of sources in Puerto Rico is lacking . The objective of this study was to determine concentrations and predictors of urinary phthalate biomarkers measured at multiple times during pregnancy among women living in the Northern karst area of Puerto Rico . METHODS We recruited 139 pregnant women in Northern Puerto Rico and collected urine samples and questionnaire data at three separate visits ( 18 Â± 2 weeks , 22 Â± 2 weeks , and 26 Â± 2 weeks of gestation ) . Urine samples were analyzed for eleven phthalate metabolites : mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP ) , mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate , mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate , mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate , mono-ethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , mono-n-butyl phthalate , mono-benzyl phthalate , mono-isobutyl phthalate , mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate ( MCPP ) , mono carboxyisononyl phthalate ( MCNP ) , and mono carboxyisooctyl phthalate ( MCOP ) . RESULTS Detectable concentrations of phthalate metabolites among pregnant women living in Puerto Rico was prevalent , and metabolite concentrations tended to be higher than or similar to those measured in women of reproductive age from the general US population . Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from very weak ( MCNP ; 0.05 ) to moderate ( MEP ; 0.44 ) reproducibility among all phthalate metabolites . We observed significant or suggestive positive associations between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and water usage/storage habits ( MEP , MCNP , MCOP ) , use of personal care products ( MEP ) , and consumption of certain food items ( MCPP , MCNP , and MCOP ) . CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge this is the first study to report concentrations , temporal variability , and predictors of phthalate biomarkers among pregnant women in Puerto Rico . Preliminary results suggest several potentially important exposure sources to phthalates in this population and future analysis from this ongoing prospective cohort will help to inform targeted approaches to reduce exposure .	24 12 22 1 244 2 241 243 127
9828301	PCDD/PCDF/PCB concentrations were measured in samples from four mothers ( at delivery and during lactation ) and their infants ( at birth and the end of first year of life ) . For two of these mothers it was the second delivery and breast-feeding period , and additional data were available from first lactation period and the first-born infant at the age of 11 to 12 months . Five of the six infants were fully breast-fed for at least 17 weeks . In four of them a distinct PCDD/PCDF/PCB accumulation was observed at the end of the first year of life : concentrations in blood fat were 1.5 to 3.6 times higher than maternal levels measured at the same time . Due to decreasing maternal body burdens during lactation , PCDD/PCDF concentrations at 11 to 12 months of life were only about half as high in the second infant as in the first one at the same age . During second pregnancy , no important change of the concentrations was observed in maternal blood .	1 122 12
12222612	The concentrations of aluminium ( Al ) , arsenic ( As ) , beryllium ( Be ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , chromium ( Cr ) , mercury ( Hg ) , manganese ( Mn ) , nickel ( Ni ) , lead ( Pb ) , tin ( Sn ) , thallium ( Tl ) , vanadium ( V ) , and zinc ( Zn ) were determined in soil samples collected in AlcalÃ¡ de Henares ( Madrid , Spain ) . Human health risks derived from metal inhalation and ingestion of soils were also assessed . For noncarcinogenic risks , the current levels of metals were usually lower than those considered as safe for the general population . With respect to the potentially carcinogenic elements As , Be , Cd , and Cr , the concentrations of Be , Cd , and Cr were lower than the reference values , while the average As concentration ( 3.4 microg/g ) was higher than the safety limit for risk cancer . In general terms , the potential human health impact of ingestion/inhalation through soils of the analyzed elements seems to be rather small .	245 24 2
12176088	An investigation of total arsenic in food composites , collected from the villagers , was carried out in arsenic-affected areas of the Murshidabad district , West Bengal where the agricultural system is mostly groundwater dependent . The shallow , large-diameter tubewells installed for agricultural irrigation contain an appreciable amount of arsenic ( mean 0.085 mg/l , n=6 ) . Even the soil is arsenic-contaminated ( mean 11.35 mg/kg , n=36 ) , so some arsenic can be expected in the food chain from crops cultivated in this area . The results revealed that the individual food composite and food groups containing the highest mean arsenic concentrations ( microg/kg ) are potato skin ( 292.62 and 104 ) , leaf of vegetables ( 212.34 and 294.67 ) , arum leaf ( 331 and 341 ) , papaya ( 196.50 and 373 ) , rice ( 226.18 and 245.39 ) , wheat ( 7 and 362 ) , cumin ( 47.86 and 209.75 ) , turmeric powder ( 297.33 and 280.9 ) , cereals and bakery goods ( 156.37 and 294.47 ) , vegetables ( 91.73 and 123.22 ) , spices ( 92.22 and 207.60 ) and miscellaneous items ( 138.37 and 137.80 ) for the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively . Arsenic is absorbed by the skin of most of the vegetables . The arsenic concentration in fleshy vegetable material is low ( mean 2.72 microg/kg , n=45 ) . Higher levels of arsenic were observed in cooked items compared with raw . Daily dietary intakes of arsenic ( microg ) from the foodstuffs for adults are 171.20 and 189.13 and for children are 91.89 and 101.63 in the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively .	24 2 243
24154821	Inorganic arsenic is methylated in the body by arsenic ( III ) methyltransferase ( AS3MT ) . Arsenic methylation is thought to play a role in arsenic-related epigenetic phenomena , including aberrant DNA and histone methylation . However , it is unclear whether the promoter of the AS3MT gene , which codes for AS3MT , is differentially methylated as a function of arsenic exposure . In this study , we evaluated AS3MT promoter methylation according to exposure , assessed by urinary arsenic excretion in a stratified random sample of 48 participants from the Strong Heart Study who had urine arsenic measured at baseline and DNA available from 1989 to 1991 and 1998-1999 . For this study , all data are from the 1989-1991 visit . We measured AS3MT promoter methylation at its 48 CpG loci by bisulphite sequencing . We compared mean % methylation at each CpG locus by arsenic exposure group using linear regression adjusted for study centre , age and sex . A hypomethylated region in the AS3MT promoter was associated with higher arsenic exposure . In vitro , arsenic induced AS3MT promoter hypomethylation , and it increased AS3MT expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . These findings may suggest that arsenic exposure influences the epigenetic regulation of a major arsenic metabolism gene .	11 1111 12 1 111 127
9828307	Effects of postnatal exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) on thyroid hormone status were studied in the peripheral blood of 36 breast-fed Japanese infants . Estimated total intakes of these chemicals in toxic equivalent quantity ( TEQ ) converted into 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( 2,3,7,8-TCDD ) from the breast milk significantly and negatively correlated with the levels of triiodothyronine ( T3 ) and thyroxine ( T4 ) in the blood of breast-fed babies . Therefore , exposure to background levels of the highly toxic organochlorine chemicals through the breast milk may cause some effects on thyroid hormone status in Japanese infants .	11 24 1 11122 1112 111 243 2
12173541	Increased concentrations of arsenic were found in soil and ground water from a military training area in Munster , Lower Saxony , Germany , where chemical weapons were dumped after World War II . In order to assess the possible impact of this contamination for nursing new-borns and infants , samples from breast milk of 36 women were analysed with respect to arsenic content . Study participants came from three different regions : the city of Hamburg , the rural area of Soltau , Lower Saxony , and from Munster , the potentially contaminated area . Breast milk samples were collected immediately before and after nursing on days 2 , 5 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , and 90 post partum . At least 10 ml were required for measurements of arsenic , and 187 samples were of that volume . Samples were analysed with a Perkin-Elmer Type 403 hydride-generation atomic absorption spectrometer , equipped with an arsenic EDL-lamp . Arsenic was not detectable , i.e. below 0.3 microgram/l , in 154 of 187 samples . The highest concentration of 2.8 micrograms/l was measured in a sample from the rural area of Soltau . Geometric means of arsenic concentrations were comparable in the three regions . Concentrations did neither differ in samples obtained before and after nursing nor with respect to age of the infant . The calculated daily intake of arsenic was in the range of 0.02 to 0.06 microgram per kg body weight , which is far below the lower limit of daily permissible intake for adults ( WHO/JECFA recommendation 1993 ) of 15 micrograms/kg/wk . In conclusion , we found concentrations of arsenic in breast milk within the reported safety limits . This was also true for samples from women living in a region which has previously been shown to be contaminated with arsenic from chemical weapons .	1 2 12 124
24149084	BACKGROUND Few studies have investigated traffic-related air pollution as a risk factor for respiratory infections during early childhood . OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and pneumonia , croup , and otitis media in 10 European birth cohorts--BAMSE ( Sweden ) , GASPII ( Italy ) , GINIplus and LISAplus ( Germany ) , MAAS ( United Kingdom ) , PIAMA ( the Netherlands ) , and four INMA cohorts ( Spain)--and to derive combined effect estimates using meta-analysis . METHODS Parent report of physician-diagnosed pneumonia , otitis media , and croup during early childhood were assessed in relation to annual average pollutant levels [ nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , nitrogen oxide ( NOx ) , particulate matterâ¤2.5 Î¼m ( PM2.5 ) , PM2.5 absorbance , PM10 , PM2.5-10 ( coarse PM) ] , which were estimated using land use regression models and assigned to children based on their residential address at birth . Identical protocols were used to develop regression models for each study area as part of the ESCAPE project . Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted effect estimates for each study , and random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate combined estimates . RESULTS For pneumonia , combined adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) were elevated and statistically significant for all pollutants except PM2.5 ( e.g. , OR=1.30 ; 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.65 per 10-Î¼g/m3 increase in NO2 and OR=1.76 ; 95% CI : 1.00 , 3.09 per 10-Î¼g/m3 PM10 ) . For otitis media and croup , results were generally null across all analyses except for NO2 and otitis media ( OR=1.09 ; 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.16 per 10-Î¼g/m3 ) . CONCLUSION Our meta-analysis of 10 European birth cohorts within the ESCAPE project found consistent evidence for an association between air pollution and pneumonia in early childhood , and some evidence for an association with otitis media .	2 231 23
12963403	The breast milk concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ; sum of five congeners : BDE-47 , -99 , -100 , -153 , and -154 ) were determined ( by GC-ECD ) in samples from 93 primiparous women collected from 1996 to 1999 in Uppsala County , Sweden . Dietary and lifestyle factors were also recorded . The mean PBDE concentration was 4.0 ng/g fat and the distribution of samples was skewed with few high values ( maximum 28.2 ng/g fat ) . BDE-47 was the major congener and constituted 59% of the mean concentration of PBDEs . No significant relationship was found between breast milk concentrations of PBDEs and dietary intake of PBDE , age , body mass index , alcohol consumption , or computer usage . After adjustments for these factors , a weak but significant association between PBDE concentrations and smoking was observed . The dietary intake of PBDE for these women was estimated at 27 ng/day , of which fish contributed almost half . After inclusion of 31 additional samples , collected from 2000 to 2001 , time trends were studied . The changes in breast milk PBDE levels between 1996 and 2001 , similar to the results from another Swedish study on milk from Stockholm mothers , suggest a peak in PBDE concentrations around 1998 and thereafter decreasing levels . However , far-reaching conclusions about PBDE time trends in milk cannot be drawn from this short study .	24 12 1 2 124 243
14501272	BACKGROUND Men who were part of an Australian petroleum industry cohort had previously been found to have an excess of lympho-hematopoietic cancer . Occupational benzene exposure is a possible cause of this excess . METHODS We conducted a case-control study of lympho-hematopoietic cancer nested within the existing cohort study to examine the role of benzene exposure . Cases identified between 1981 and 1999 ( N = 79 ) were age-matched to 5 control subjects from the cohort . We estimated each subject's benzene exposure using occupational histories , local site-specific information , and an algorithm using Australian petroleum industry monitoring data . RESULTS Matched analyses showed that the risk of leukemia was increased at cumulative exposures above 2 ppm-years and with intensity of exposure of highest exposed job over 0.8 ppm . Risk increased with higher exposures ; for the 13 case-sets with greater than 8 ppm-years cumulative exposure , the odds ratio was 11.3 ( 95% confidence interval = 2.85-45.1 ) . The risk of leukemia was not associated with start date or duration of employment . The association with type of workplace was explained by cumulative exposure . There is limited evidence that short-term high exposures carry more risk than the same amount of exposure spread over a longer period . The risks for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were raised for the highest exposed workers . No association was found between non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma and benzene exposure , nor between tobacco or alcohol consumption and any of the cancers . CONCLUSIONS We found an excess risk of leukemia associated with cumulative benzene exposures and benzene exposure intensities that were considerably lower than reported in previous studies . No evidence was found of a threshold cumulative exposure below which there was no risk .	2 21
20004003	A cross sectional study was carried out to evaluate arsenic exposure of residents living in an area with a soil naturally rich in arsenic ( As ) , through urinary measurements . During the summer of 2007 , 322 people aged over 7 years and resident in the study area for at least 4 days prior to the investigation were recruited . The sum of urinary inorganic arsenic and metabolites ( iAs+MMA+DMA ) and speciation were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry , respectively . Geometric means levels of iAs+MMA+DMA were 3.6 microg/L or 4.4 microg/g creatinine . The percent of DMA , As(III) and MMA contribution to urinary arsenic concentrations was respectively 84.2% , 12% and 3.7% . We found significant associations between urinary arsenic concentrations and the consumption of seafood ( p=0.03 ) , the consumption of wine ( p=0.03 ) and beer ( p=0.001 ) , respectively 3 and 4 days before the investigation . When we focus on the various species , As(V) was rarely detected and DMA is the predominant metabolite composing the majority of measurable inorganic-related As in the urine . Considering the percent of DMA contribution to iAs+MMA+DMA urinary concentrations , almost half of the subjects had 100% of DMA contribution whatever the concentration of urinary As whereas the others had a lower DMA contribution , between 39 and 90% . Arsenic levels reported in this original study in France were between 2 and 4 times lower than in other studies dealing with iAs+MMA+DMA levels associated with soil arsenic exposure . Arsenic levels were similar to those observed in unexposed individuals in European countries , although 10% were above the French guideline values for the general population .	24 12 1 2 243 127
19945738	In 2003 UNIDO ( United Nations Industrial Development Organization ) conducted an environmental and health assessment in a small-scale mining area in Tanzania . BGS ( British Geological Survey ) performed the environmental assessment . The Institute of Forensic Medicine - University of Munich performed the health assessment . The results of the medical , neurological and neuro-psychological examination of 180 participants from the affected area of Rwamagasa and 31 controls were analyzed . Urine , blood and hair samples were analyzed to detect the level of mercury body burden . Mercury concentrations in the bio-monitors urine , blood and hair were statistically significantly higher in the exposed population from Rwamagasa compared to the control group from Katoro . Only amalgam burners showed mercury levels above the toxicological threshold limits . A speciation of mercury in hair indicated that mainly elemental mercury vapor contributed to the high body burden of the artisanal miners. 104 amalgam-burners , the most exposed population group , were examined. 25 of these workers were found to be intoxicated . Small-scale mining is a serious health hazard for amalgam burners . Reduction of the exposure is essential to prevent further damage .	1 12 122 123 127
21111447	The aim was to determine half-life of six most abundant PCB congeners in the body of early adolescents . In 304 environmentally exposed children , PCB serum concentration was determined at the age of 8 and 12years . Half-life was determined for each child assuming exponential decrease or for the whole cohort using multiple regression . Results obtained by both approaches were in agreement . PCB reuptakes corrupting half-life estimates for each child and each congener were evaluated . If one of the serum PCB concentration values fell below the level of detection ( LOD ) the pair was excluded and if PCB half-life value exceeded the arbitrary value of 30years . The following median half-lives in years 4.46 , 10.59 , 9.7 , 4.7 , 9.1 and 9.8 were obtained for PCB congeners 118 , 138(+163) , 153 , 156(+171) , 170 and 180 , respectively . The elimination half-life values were not systematically related to PCB serum concentration at any examination age . Between half-life values , percentage of children with significant reuptakes and PCB congener abundance in serum were found significant associations .	1 122 12
22237700	15 road and 14 soil dust samples were collected from an oilfield city , Dongying , from 11/2009-4/2010 and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy ( ICP-MS ) for V , Cr , Mn , Co , Ni , Cu , Zn , As , Cd and Pb within PM(2.5) , PM(10) and PM(100) fractions synchronously . Metal concentrations , sources and human health risk were studied . Results showed that both soil and road dust exhibited higher values for Mn and Zn and lower values for Co and Cd for the three fractions . Mass concentration ratios of PM(2.5)/PM(10) and PM(10)/PM(100) for metals in road and soil dust indicate that most of the heavy metals tend to concentrate in fine particles . Geoaccumulation index and enrichment factors analysis showed that Cu , Zn and Cd exhibited moderate or heavy contamination and significant enrichment , indicating the influence of anthropogenic sources . Vanadium , Cr , Mn and Co were mostly not enriched and were mainly influenced by crustal sources . For Ni , As and Pb , they ranged from not enriched to moderately enriched and were influenced by both crustal materials and anthropogenic sources . The conclusions were confirmed by multivariate analysis methods . Principle component analysis revealed that the major sources were vehicle emission , industrial activities , coal combustion , agricultural activities and crustal materials . The risk assessment results indicated that metal ingestion appeared to be the main exposure route followed by dermal contact . The most likely cause for cancer and other health risks are both the fine particles of soil and road dusts .	245 24 2 22
14594622	No previous reports exist on polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) congeners in human milk from individual U.S. mothers . This article on PBDEs is an extension of our previous studies on concentrations of dioxins , dibenzofurans , polychlorinated biphenyls , and other chlorinated organic compounds in human milk in a number of countries . PBDE commercial products are used as flame retardants in flexible polyurethane foam ( penta-BDE ) , in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins ( octa-BDE ) , and in high-impact polystyrene resins ( deca-BDE ) . Their use is permitted in the United States but is banned in some European countries because of presumed toxicity , demonstrated persistence , and bioaccumulation . Different commercial products can be found in various consumer products such as television sets , computers , computer monitors and printers , carpets , and upholstery . Analyses of human levels of these compounds suggest low but rising levels in European human milk , which may have peaked , at least in Sweden , in the late 1990s . Very few data exist on levels of PBDEs in humans in the United States , and none from milk from individual nursing mothers . To address this issue , we analyzed 47 individual milk samples from nursing mothers , 20-41 years of age , from a milk bank in Austin , Texas , and a community women's health clinic in Dallas , Texas . Up to 13 PBDE congeners were measured . The concentrations of the sum of PBDE congeners varied from 6.2 to 419 ng/g ( or parts per billion ) lipid , with a median of 34 ng/g and a mean of 73.9 ng/g lipid . The PBDE levels in breast milk from Texas were similar to levels found in U.S. blood and adipose tissue lipid from California and Indiana and are 10-100 times greater than human tissue levels in Europe . Their detection in breast milk raises concern for potential toxicity to nursing infants , given the persistence and bioaccumulative nature of some of the PBDE congeners . These results indicate a need for more detailed investigation of the levels of PBDE in people and food , as well as determining if animal fat in food is the major route of exposure of the general U.S. population . Other routes of intake may also be significant .	1 12 124
19888312	The accuracy of the exposure assessment is a critical factor in epidemiological investigations of pesticide exposures and health in agricultural populations . However , few studies have been conducted to evaluate questionnaire-based exposure metrics . The Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) is a prospective cohort study of pesticide applicators who provided detailed questionnaire information on their use of specific pesticides . A field study was conducted for a subset of the applicators enrolled in the AHS to assess a pesticide exposure algorithm through comparison of algorithm intensity scores with measured exposures . Pre- and post-application urinary biomarker measurements were made for 2,4-D ( n=69 ) and chlorpyrifos ( n=17 ) applicators . Dermal patch , hand wipe , and personal air samples were also collected . Intensity scores were calculated using information from technician observations and an interviewer-administered questionnaire . Correlations between observer and questionnaire intensity scores were high ( Spearman's r=0.92 and 0.84 for 2,4-D and chlorpyrifos , respectively ) . Intensity scores from questionnaires for individual applications were significantly correlated with post-application urinary concentrations for both 2,4-D ( r=0.42 , P&lt;0.001 ) and chlorpyrifos ( r=0.53 , P=0.035 ) applicators . Significant correlations were also found between intensity scores and estimated hand loading , estimated body loading , and air concentrations for 2,4-D applicators ( r-values 0.28-0.50 , P-values&lt;0.025 ) . Correlations between intensity scores and dermal and air measures were generally lower for chlorpyrifos applicators using granular products . A linear regression model indicated that the algorithm factors for individual applications explained 24% of the variability in post-application urinary 2,4-D concentration , which increased to 60% when the pre-application urine concentration was included . The results of the measurements support the use of the algorithm for estimating questionnaire-based exposure intensities in the AHS for liquid pesticide products . Refinement of the algorithm may be possible using the results from this and other measurement studies .	12 22 23 1 2 127 233
21094490	BACKGROUND Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that metal-rich particles may enhance allergic responses to house dust mites and induce an increased release of allergy-related cytokines . OBJECTIVES The main goal of this analysis is to define the possible association of intrauterine exposure to lead and mercury with the occurrence of skin sensitization to common aeroallergens in early childhood . MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study refers to a sample of 224 women in the second trimester of pregnancy recruited from Krakow inner city area who had full term pregnancies and whose children underwent skin prick testing ( SPT ) at the age of 5 . Lead and mercury levels were assessed in cord blood and retested in children at age of 5 years . Aeroallergen concentrations in house dust were measured at the age of 3 years . The main health outcome ( atopic status ) was defined as the positive SPT to at least one common aeroallergen ( Der f1 , Der p1 , Can f1 and Fel d1 ) at the age of 5 years . In the statistical analysis of the association between atopic status of children and exposure to metals , the study considered a set of covariates such as maternal characteristics ( age , education , atopy ) , child's gender , number of older siblings , prenatal ( measured via cord blood cotinine ) and postnatal environmental tobacco smoke together with exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) as measured by PAH-DNA adducts . RESULTS AND CONCLUSION In the binary regression analysis , which controlled for the confounders , the risk ratio ( RR ) estimate for atopic sensitization was significantly associated with the lead exposure ( RR=2.25 , 95%CI : 1.21-4.19 ) . In conclusion , the data suggest that even very low-level of prenatal lead exposure may be implicated in enhancing sensitization to common aeroallergens in early childhood .	1 122 12
14594632	Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) , the most commonly used plasticizer in flexible polyvinylchloride formulations , is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant . To date , no information exists on the potential health hazards from exposure to DEHP and/or its main metabolite , mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( MEHP ) , in high-risk conditions , such as pregnancy and during the neonatal period . The aim of this study was to evaluate prenatal exposure to DEHP and/or MEHP and its possible biologic effects . We measured serum DEHP and MEHP concentrations in the cord blood of 84 consecutive newborns by high-performance liquid chromatography . Relationships between DEHP/MEHP and infant characteristics were tested using Fisher's exact test , unpaired t-tests , and univariate linear regression analyses , and significant differences on univariate analysis were evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis . We found detectable cord blood DEHP and/or MEHP concentrations in 88.1% of the samples . Either DEHP or MEHP was present in 65 of 84 ( 77.4% ) of the examined samples . Mean concentrations of DEHP and MEHP were 1.19 +/- 1.15 microg/mL [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.93-1.44 , range = 0-4.71 ] and 0.52 +/- 0.61 microg/mL ( 95% CI , 0.39-0.66 , range = 0-2.94 ) , respectively . MEHP-positive newborns showed a significantly lower gestational age compared with MEHP-negative infants ( p = 0.033 ) . Logistic regression analysis results indicated a positive correlation between absence of MEHP in cord blood and gestational age at delivery ( odds ratio = 1.50 , 95% CI , 1.013-2.21 ; p = 0.043 ) . These findings confirm that human exposure to DEHP can begin in utero and suggest that phthalate exposure is significantly associated with a shorter pregnancy duration .	11 1 122 12 112
22334237	Prenatal mercury exposure and its fetotoxic effects may be of particular concern in urban immigrant communities as a result of possible contributing cultural factors . The most common source of exposure in these communities is ingestion of fish and shellfish contaminated with methylmercury . Other sources of exposure may occur in ritualistic practices associated with Hispanic and Caribbean-based religions . This study 1 ) assessed total mercury levels in both random urine specimens from pregnant women , and in cord blood ; and 2 ) examined environmental sources of exposure from a convenience sample in a predominantly Caribbean immigrant population in Brooklyn , New York . A questionnaire designed in collaboration with health professionals from the Caribbean community assessed the frequency of fish consumption , ritualistic practices , occupational exposures , and use of dental amalgams and mercury-containing skin and household products . The geometric mean for total mercury in cord blood was 2.14 Î¼g L(-1) ( 95%CI : 1.76-2.60 ) ( n = 78 ) , and 0.45 Î¼g L(-1) ( 95%CI : 0.37-0.55 ) ( n = 183 ) in maternal urine corrected for creatinine ( Î¼g g(-1) ) . Sixteen percent of cord blood mercury levels exceeded the estimated equivalent of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Reference Dose ( 5.8 Î¼g L(-1) blood ) . Predictors of cord blood mercury included maternal fish consumption and foreign birth of the mother . Predictors of urine mercury included foreign birth of the mother , number of dental amalgams , and special product use . There were no reports of mercury use in ritualistic practices or in cosmetics ; however some women reported use of religious medals and charms . This study characterized risk factors for mercury exposure in a sample of urban , predominantly Caribbean-born blacks . Findings may help target interventions in this population , which might include appropriate fish selection and consumption frequency during pregnancy , and safe handling of mercury-containing products in the home .	24 12 1 244 122 2 243 127
19878931	The purposes of this study were to assess the hair mercury concentration of women of childbearing age in Taiwan , and to calculate a hazard quotient ( HQ ) to evaluate the risk of fish consumption for these women . We also examined perceptions of risk associated with fish consumption and whether women in our study changed their habits in response to such risks . The average concentration of mercury was 1.73+/-2.12microgg(-1) ( range : 0.02-16.34microgg(-1) ) , exceeding the US EPA reference dose of 1microgg(-1) in 52.9% of study subjects . The WHO tolerance limit of 10microgg(-1) was exceeded in 1.5% of study subjects . Hair mercury concentration in groups who consumed fish was significantly higher than in groups who never consumed fish ( p&lt;0.05 ) . The hazard quotient ( exposure estimate/oral reference dose ) exceeded 1.0 for 29% of subjects , based on the US EPA's reference dose ( 0.1microgkg(-1)d(-1) ) , and the average HQ equaled 1.26 . When told that some fish contain high levels of mercury that may be harmful for unborn babies , 67.6% of women still indicated that they would not change their amount of fish intake . The high hair mercury concentrations among women of childbearing age in Taiwan are a cause for concern , due to the effect on babies ' brain development . The government should provide specific information about risks and benefits of fish consumption for women to make risk-balancing decisions .	24 12 1 123 243 2
19854248	Cadmium ( Cd ) is a widespread , highly toxic environmental pollutant known to accumulate in human placenta . The aim of the present study was to elucidate to what extent the accumulation of Cd in human placenta interacts with the transport of micronutrients to the fetus . Cd and micronutrients were measured in placenta and umbilical cord blood from 44 non-smoking , rural Bangladeshi women , using ICPMS . Metallothionein ( MT ) protein expression was determined in placenta using Western blot . Cd in placenta ( median 110 microg/kg dry weight , 20 microg/kg wet weight ) was positively associated with maternal urinary Cd . It was also positively associated with Cd in umbilical cord blood ( median 0.16 microg/kg ) , but negatively associated with zinc ( Zn ; median 3mg/kg ) in umbilical cord blood . Umbilical cord blood Zn was positively associated with birth anthropometry measures , and the Cd-related impairment of Zn in umbilical cord blood seemed to decrease size at birth . In multivariate analysis , MT protein expression was associated with Cd ( positively ) in placenta , but not with Zn or copper ( Cu ) in placenta . In conclusion , the Cd concentrations in placenta were clearly elevated , which seemed to impair Zn transfer to the fetus . Induction of MT explained the placental accumulation of Cd , but not the impairment of Zn transport .	11 12 112 1 122 11123 111 126 127 1112
14644662	Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic ( In-As ) from drinking water is associated with different health effects , including skin , lung , bladder , and kidney cancer as well as vascular and possibly reproductive effects . In-As is metabolized through the process of methylation , resulting in the production and excretion of methylated species , mainly monomethylarsenate ( MMA ) and dimethylarsenate ( DMA ) . Because a large percentage of the dose is excreted in urine , the distribution of urinary In-As , MMA , and DMA is considered a useful indicator of methylation patterns in human populations . Several factors affect these patterns , including sex and exposure level . In this study , we investigated the profile of urinary In-As , MMA , and DMA of pregnant women . Periodic urine samples were collected from early to late pregnancy among 29 pregnant women living in Antofagasta , Chile , who drank tap water containing 40 micro g/L In-As . The total urinary arsenic across four sampling periods increased with increasing weeks of gestation , from an initial mean value of 36.1 to a final value of 54.3 micro g/L . This increase was mainly due to an increase in DMA , resulting in lower percentages of In-As and MMA and a higher percentage of DMA . Our findings indicate that among women exposed to moderate arsenic from drinking water during pregnancy , changes occur in the pattern of urinary arsenic excretion and metabolite distribution . The toxicologic significance of this is not clear , given recent evidence suggesting that intermediate methylated species may be highly toxic . Nevertheless , this study suggests that arsenic metabolism changes throughout the course of pregnancy , which in turn may have toxicologic effects on the developing fetus . Key words : arsenic , arsenic metabolism , arsenic methylation , Chile , pregnancy , urinary arsenic .	24 12 1 2 241 127
21074246	Levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) were measured in the breast milk of mothers living in Giugliano ( Campania , Italy ) , an area at increased risk of PCDD and PCDF exposure caused by recent and serious open-air waste-combustion accidents . Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in milk samples were also studied . Breast milk was also monitored in two cities in northern Italy , Milan and Piacenza , which were selected as controls . Other variables , such as diet and age of the mothers , were also studied . PCDD/F and PCB levels and congener profiles in breast-milk samples were similar in all these cities , though total PCDD/F and DL-PCB TEQs in samples from Giugliano were significantly lower than those in Milan and Piacenza ( 8.65 pg WHO-TEQ in Giugliano vs. 11.0 and 9.94 pg WHO-TEQ in Milan and Piacenza respectively ) . Thus no direct correlations were found between PCDD/F and PCB levels in breast milk and the suspected increased exposure through open-air waste combustion in Giugliano . Diet did not seem to affect PCDD/F and PCB levels , whereas a significant correlation was observed between the mother's age and an increased concentration of PCDDs/Fs and PCBs in milk . Comparison of these findings with those of previous surveys in Italy in 2000-2001 showed a marked reduction of PCDD/F ( about 60% ) and DL-PCB ( about 20% ) levels in breast milk occurring over the last 10 years . This might well be a result of well functioning legislation , for example European Directives on of the reduction of the emission limits of PCDDs/Fs and PCBs from waste incineration set by EU Directive 2000/76/EC implemented in 2000 , or Commission Regulations such as ( EC ) No. 466/2001 and 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs .	24 12 1 2 124 243
14644672	Remote coastal populations that rely on seafood for subsistence often receive unusually high doses of organochlorines and methyl mercury . Immunosuppression resulting from prenatal exposure to organochlorines has been reported in wildlife species and humans . In this study , we assessed lymphocyte activation and associated cytokine secretion in 47 newborns from a remote maritime population living on the Mid and Lower North Shore regions of the St. Lawrence River ( QuÃ©bec , Canada ; subsistence fishing group ) and 65 newborns from nearby urban settings ( reference group ) . Cord blood samples were collected for organochlorine and mercury analyses and also to isolate cord blood mononuclear cells ( CBMCs ) for the in vitro assessment of cytokine production and expression of surface markers after mitogenic stimulation ( CD4(+)CD45RO(+) , CD8(+)CD45RO(+) , CD3(+)CD25(+) , and CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) ) . Blood mercury and plasma concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) , and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) were significantly higher in the subsistence fishing group than in the reference group ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) . No difference was observed between the two groups regarding subsets of lymphocytes showing markers of activation . In vitro secretion of cytokines by CBMCs after mitogenic stimulation was lower in the subsistence fishing group than in the reference group ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) . Moreover , we found an inverse correlation between tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) secretion and plasma PCB , p,p'-DDE , and HCB concentrations ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) . Our data support a negative association between TNF-alpha secretion by CBMCs and prenatal organochlorine exposure . If the relationship between organochlorine and TNF-alpha secretion is causal , it would suggest a role for this important proinflammatory cytokine in mediating organochlorine-induced immunotoxicity in infants developmentally exposed to these compounds .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 1112
14652304	Numerous epidemiologic investigations have identified links between high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water and cancer , although the risks at lower exposures are largely unknown . This paper presents the results of a case-control study of arsenic ingestion and bladder cancer in seven counties in the western United States . These counties contain the largest populations historically exposed to drinking water arsenic at concentrations near 100 microg/liter . All incident cases diagnosed from 1994 to 2000 were recruited . Individual data on water sources , water consumption patterns , smoking , and other factors were collected for 181 cases and 328 controls . Overall , no increased risks were identified for arsenic intakes greater than 80 microg/day ( odds ratio=0.94 , 95% confidence interval : 0.56 , 1.57 ; linear trend , p=0.48 ) . These risks are below predictions based on high dose studies from Taiwan . When the analysis was focused on exposures 40 or more years ago , an odds ratio of 3.67 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.43 , 9.42 ; linear trend , p&lt;0.01 ) was identified for intakes greater than 80 microg/day ( median intake , 177 microg/day ) in smokers . These data provide some evidence that smokers who ingest arsenic at concentrations near 200 microg/day may be at increased risk of bladder cancer .	24 2 241
22420473	AIMS Bisphenol A ( BPA)-based dental composites have commonly been used to fill dental cavities or seal pits and fissures on teeth . However , epidemiological evidence with regard to the BPA exposure from dental composites among children has rarely been reported . This study investigated whether there is a relationship between the BPA concentration in urine and the presence of composite restorations and sealants among South Korean children . METHODS Oral examinations and urine sample analyses were conducted on a total of 495 children aged 8-9 years . We classified the participants into four groups by the number of resin composites and sealant surfaces ( 0 , 1-5 , 6-10 and 11+ ) . RESULTS BPA concentrations in urine were higher in children with 11 or more surfaces restored with sealants and resin composites than in those with zero restored surfaces , although no difference was seen in the group with 1-10 surfaces . After adjusting for gender and age , the urinary BPA concentration in children with 11 or more resin composite surfaces was 2.67 Î¼g/g creatinine , which was higher than the concentration found in those with no filling surfaces ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS Having many dental composite filling surfaces on teeth may increase the urinary BPA concentration in children .	24 12 1 244 2 127
12493183	In order to evaluate the influence of specific factors on mercury ( P-Hg ) levels and antioxidant power ( P-FRAP ) in human plasma , 26 healthy donors were examined by a dentist , their plasma analyzed for Hg by atomic absorption spectrometry and for total antioxidant activity by FRAP method . Hg plasma concentration was found to be correlated with the number of amalgam fillings , suggesting that Hg released from fillings is a source of Hg in non-occupational exposed subjects . P-FRAP correlated negatively with P-Hg suggesting a pro-oxidant role of the Hg released from amalgam fillings . Though age by itself was not significantly correlated with P-FRAP , when considered together with P-Hg in multivariate analysis , it was found to be a major related cofactor . Multivariate analysis showed no influence of fish consumption or cigarette smoking on P-FRAP .	24 11 12 1 244 122 2 111 1114 243
22433121	BACKGROUND Jet propulsion fuel-8 ( JP-8 ) is the primary jet fuel used by the US military , collectively consuming billion gallons annually . Previous reports suggest that JP-8 is potentially toxic to the immune , respiratory , and nervous systems . The objectives of this study were to evaluate inhalation exposure to JP-8 constituents among active duty United States Air Force ( USAF ) personnel while performing job-related tasks , identify significant predictors of inhalation exposure to JP-8 , and evaluate the extent to which surrogate exposure classifications were predictive of measured JP-8 exposures . METHODS Seventy-three full-time USAF personnel from three different air force bases were monitored during four consecutive workdays where personal air samples were collected and analyzed for benzene , ethylbenzene , toluene , xylenes , total hydrocarbons ( THC ) , and naphthalene . The participants were categorized a priori into high- and low-exposure groups , based on their exposure to JP-8 during their typical workday . Additional JP-8 exposure categories included job title groups and self-reported exposure to JP-8 . Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate predictors of personal air concentrations . RESULTS The concentrations of THC in air were significantly different between a priori exposure groups ( 2.6 mg m(-3) in high group versus 0.5 mg m(-3) in low , P &lt ; 0.0001 ) , with similar differences observed for other analytes in air . Naphthalene was strongly correlated with THC ( r = 0.82 , P &lt ; 0.0001 ) and both were positively correlated with the relative humidity of the work environment . Exposures to THC and naphthalene varied significantly by job categories based on USAF specialty codes and were highest among personnel working in fuel distribution/maintenance , though self-reported exposure to JP-8 was an even stronger predictor of measured exposure in models that explained 72% ( THC ) and 67% ( naphthalene ) of between-worker variability . In fact , both self-report JP-8 exposure and a priori exposure groups explained more between-worker variability than job categories . CONCLUSIONS Personal exposure to JP-8 varied by job and was positively associated with the relative humidity . However , self-reported exposure to JP-8 was an even stronger predictor of measured exposure than job title categories , suggesting that self-reported JP-8 exposure is a valid surrogate metric of exposure when personal air measurements are not available .	2 233 23
22470285	Zinc supplementation reduces the duration , severity and recurrence of diarrhoea in young children . This study examines whether zinc , found naturally in drinking water , reduced infant deaths from diarrhoea in rural Bangladesh . Information was compiled for births over two calendar years with follow-up for deaths within one year of birth . The study included 29,744 live births and 934 deaths in some 600 villages under the care of Gonoshasthaya Kendra ( GK ) , grouped into 15 health centre regions within 12 upazillas . Individual matching of death to birth data was not possible , but information on exposures through well water and on potential confounders was available for each upazilla . Average concentration of zinc in well water , reported by the British Geological Survey , was grouped into high ( &gt;0.07 mg/L ) , moderate ( 0.020-0.070 mg/L ) and low ( &lt;0.020 mg/L ) concentrations . Odds ratios ( OR ) were calculated for zinc by age and cause of death . Zinc concentration was unrelated to all-cause mortality but a decrease in deaths from diarrhoea ( N = 50 ) was seen in areas with high zinc ( OR = 0.30 ; 95% CI 0.13-0.69 ) . No relation to diarrhoeal deaths was found with other well contaminants ( arsenic , manganese ) having accounted for zinc . Upazillas with a high proportion of women without education had higher rates of death from diarrhea , but the decrease in risk with high zinc remained ( OR adjusted = 0.41 ; 95% CI 0.20-0.84 ) . It is concluded that exposure to zinc through drinking water may reduce risk of diarrhoeal deaths .	24 2 241
19608217	This study was performed to explore possible environmental risk factors , including indoor chemicals , mold , and dust mite allergens , which could cause sick building syndrome ( SBS)-type symptoms in new houses . The study was conducted in 2004 and 2005 and the final study population consisted of 86 men and 84 women residing in Okayama , Japan . The indoor concentrations of indoor aldehydes , volatile organic compounds , airborne fungi , and dust mite allergens in their living rooms were measured and the longitudinal changes in two consecutive years were calculated . A standardized questionnaire was used concomitantly to gather information on frequency of SBS-type symptoms and lifestyle habits . About 10% of the subjects suffered from SBS in the both years . Crude analyses indicated tendencies for aldehyde levels to increase frequently and markedly in the newly diseased and ongoing SBS groups . Among the chemical factors and molds examined , increases in benzene and in Aspergillus contributed to the occurrence of SBS in the logistic regression model . Indoor chemicals were the main contributors to subjective symptoms associated with SBS . A preventive strategy designed to lower exposure to indoor chemicals may be able to counter the occurrence of SBS .	11 23 1 2 112 232
12523955	Through literature survey , paired data on cadmium ( Cd ) and beta(2)-microglobulin ( beta(2)-MG ) levels ( as corrected for creatinine concentration ) in urine ( i.e. , Cd-Ucr and beta(2)-MG-Ucr ) among Japanese populations were available for 32 groups of men and 58 groups of women in 12 publications . Plotting of the Cd-Ucr and beta(2)-MG-Ucr data for the groups of women showed that beta(2)-MG-Ucr stayed unchanged when Cd-Ucr was at lower levels , whereas beta(2)-MG-Ucr increased sharply when Cd-Ucr was in excess of 10-20 microg/g cr . Regression analysis was made for groups of women with no elevation in beta(2)-MG-Ucr , and those with &gt;400 or &gt;1000 microg beta(2)-MG-U/g cr . A threshold Cd-Ucr level in relation to an increase in beta(2)-MG-Ucr was estimated as Cd-Ucr at the point of intercept of the two regression lines , one with no beta(2)-MG-Ucr elevation , and the other with &gt;400 or &gt;1000 microg beta(2)-MG-U/g cr . Cd-Ucr at the point of flexion thus calculated was 11-12 microg/g cr . Such observation was quantitatively reproduced by the analysis of data for men , giving 10-11 microg Cd-U/g cr at the point of flexion . This study suggests that the relationship of beta(2)-MG-Ucr with Cd-Ucr is not linear but in the shape of letter ' J ' , i.e. , beta(2)-MG-Ucr increases sharply when Cd-Ucr is in excess of 10-12 microg/g cr .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
22502665	BACKGROUND High incidence of gallbladder cancer ( GBC ) is reported from North India , with elevated concentrations of heavy metals in water and soil . This Indo-Japan collaborative study compared presence of heavy metals in gallbladder tissues . METHODS Heavy metal concentrations were estimated in Indian GBC and cholecystitis tissues and compared with Japanese GBC and cholecystitis tissues . Spectrophotometry was done for 13 Indian gallbladder tissues ( 8 GBC , 5 cholecystitis ) and 9 Japanese ( 5 GBC , 4 cholecystitis ) . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) thin foil element analysis was done in 10 Indian samples ( 6 GBC , 4 cholecystitis ) . RESULTS Chromium , lead , arsenic and zinc were significantly high in Indian GBC compared with Japanese GBC . Chromium , lead and arsenic were significantly high in the Indian cholecystitis tissues compared to the Japanese . TEM of Indian tissues demonstrated electron dense deposits in GBC . CONCLUSION Heavy metals- chromium , lead , arsenic and zinc are potential carcinogens in Indian GBC from endemic areas . This preliminary study links presence of heavy metals in gallbladder cancer tissues in endemic areas .	1 12 125
12526896	A baseline for exposure to organochlorine and metal contaminants has been established for mothers and newborns in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut areas of Arctic Canada . Maternal and umbilical cord blood plasma organochlorine levels are described for Inuit , Dene , MÃ©tis , Caucasian and Other non-Aboriginal participants . Overall , 523 women volunteered to participate by giving their written informed consent between May 1994 and June 1999 , resulting in the collection of 386 maternal blood samples , 407 cord blood samples and 351 maternal/cord pairs . Nearly half of all the participants regularly smoked cigarettes , including 77% of the Inuit participants . Maternal and cord results are presented for PCBs ( as Aroclor 1260 and 14 congeners ) and organochlorine pesticides , including p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDE , beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( beta-HCH ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , cis and trans nonachlor , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane , mirex , dieldrin and toxaphene . Maternal PCB levels ( as Aroclor 1260 ) averaged 4.42 ( +/-9.03 ) microg/l in Inuit , which was 3.3 times higher than those found in Dene/MÃ©tis , and 3.4 times higher than levels in Caucasians . Mean DDE levels were 2.8 times higher in the Other non-Aboriginal group ( Chinese , Filipino , East Indian and multiple ethnicity ) than in the Inuit group , at 3.99 microg/l and 1.42 microg/l , respectively . Cord blood PCB levels ( as Aroclor 1260 ) averaged 1.16 ( +/-2.42 ) microg/l for Inuit participants , which was 3.3-4 fold higher than the other ethnic groups . PCBs , p,p'-DDE and hexachlorobenzene were detected in all maternal samples , and p,p'-DDE was detected in all cord samples . Regression coefficients for maternal/cord pairs are presented for selected organochlorines . Other results from this study , including maternal and cord metals data , will be presented elsewhere .	1 122 12
19573893	BACKGROUND In 2005 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) - International Programme on Chemical Safety reevaluated the toxic equivalency factors ( TEFs ) for dioxin-like compounds and made changes that affect the calculation of the total toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) . The impact of these changes on the TEQs for human blood and abiotic matrices such as soil and household dust has not been widely assessed or reported . METHODS AND RESULTS Using a major exposure study which examined blood , household dust , and soil levels of dioxin-like compounds in several regions of Michigan , we found the mean total TEQ was significantly reduced by 26% , 12% and 14% for serum , household dust , and soil , respectively , when the TEQ was based on the 2005 TEFs compared to the 1998 TEFs . The decrease in the serum total TEQ was largely due to the down-weighting of the TEFs for the majority of mono-ortho PCBs . In contrast , the decrease in the soil total TEQ was mostly due to the down-weighting of the TEF for 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran ( PeCDF ) ( 1998 TEF=0.5 , 2005 TEF=0.3 ) . For household dust , the decrease in total TEQ was not due to any single TEF but was due to small changes in a number of compounds . There was a dramatic decrease ( -88% ) in the mean and 95th percentile for mono-ortho PCB TEQ due to the 2005 TEFs . DISCUSSION These findings suggest that comparisons between studies based on the TEQ-WHO(98) and TEQ-WHO(05) may need to consider an appropriate conversion factor to assure comparability . Furthermore , the changes in TEFs may have impact in locations where regulations of soil contamination are triggered by specific TEQ levels .	24 245 12 1 122 2 242
19573251	BACKGROUND The deleterious biological effects of low-level , long-term exposure to heavy metals are well known , and children are the most susceptible population . Dabaoshan Mine in the southeast of Guangdong Province is at high risk of discharging multi-metals pollutants into a local river ( Hengshihe ) and the surrounding area . The present study aimed to estimate relationships between measured multi-metal exposures and the presence of behavioural problems for the school-aged children in the polluted area . METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed . Children aged 7-16 years living in three villages of the Hengshihe area with different degrees of heavy-metal pollution participated in this study . Local environmental samples ( water and crops ) and children's hair were collected , and concentrations of heavy metals were determined . The Child Behaviour Check-list ( CBCL ) was used to assess the presence of behaviour problems . General linear regression was used to analyze the contribution of hair metals to each CBCL subscale with adjustment for socio-demographic confounding factors . RESULTS Multiple regression analyses revealed significant effects of hair lead , cadmium and zinc levels on CBCL subscales . Log-transformed hair lead , cadmium and zinc levels accounted for an incremental of 8% to 15% variance in anxious/depressed , withdrawn , somatic complaints , social problems , thought problems , attention problems , delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour . The concurrent log-transformed hair lead and zinc levels were strongly associated with all subscales while the concurrent log-transformed hair cadmium was only significantly associated with withdrawn , social problems and attention problems . CONCLUSION This study reveals that heavy metal exposure was associated with increased risk of behavioral problems for school-aged children .	11 1 123 12 112
22536276	Heavy metals , particularly cadmium , lead , and arsenic , constitute a significant potential threat to human health . This study was conducted to determine the levels of cadmium , lead , and arsenic in nail samples from farmers at Muda Agricultural Development Authority ( MADA ) , Kedah , Malaysia , and evaluate factors that can contribute to their accumulations . A total of 116 farmers participated in this study . Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) was used to analyze concentration of heavy metals in the nail samples and questionnaires were given to participants to get demographic , health status , and their agricultural activities data . In this paper , the level of heavy metals was within the normal range and varies according to demographic factors . We found that there were significant correlations between working period with level of lead and arsenic ( r=0.315 and r=0.242 , resp. , P&lt;0.01 ) and age with lead level ( r=0.175 , P&lt;0.05 ) . Our findings suggested that agricultural activities could contribute to the accumulation of heavy metals in farmers . Hence , the control of environmental levels of and human exposure to these metals to prevent adverse health effects is still an important public health issue .	1 123 12
12553183	The health hazards of occupational exposure to Mercury ( Hg ) in adult gold miners are well known , but little attention has been given to the effects of Hg exposure in the children of gold miners . Children who assist their parents in gold mining operations or live in mining enclaves may be exposed to elemental Hg vapors or methylmercury-contaminated food , both of which may induce neurodevelopmental disabilities . Brainstem auditory-evoked responses ( BAER ) were measured as biomarkers of subtle mercury-induced neurological impairment in Andean children of gold miners living in the Ecuadorian gold mining settlement of Nambija , where Hg exposure is prevalent . Thirty-one children ( 19 boys and 12 girls , aged 4-14 years , mean age : 10 years ) in the study group were found to have a mean blood mercury ( HgB ) level of 23.0 micrograms/L ( SD : 19 , range : 2.0-89.0 micrograms/L ; median : 20 micrograms/L ) , which was significantly higher than the mean HgB level of a reference group of 21 Ecuadorian children ( 4.5 micrograms/L , SD : 2.3 ; t = 4.39 , P = 0.0001 ) , and in excess of the health-based biological limits for the U.S . ( 10 micrograms/L ) . The BAER measures indicated statistically significant differences in interpeak III-V ( P = 0.03 ) and I-V ( P = 0.008 ) neural conduction times for children with HgB levels above the median . BAERs at the conventional click stimulus rate of 10/second showed statistically significant positive correlations between HgB level and the absolute latency of wave V ( P = 0.03 ) , and the neural conduction times of the eighth nerve to midbrain I-V interval ( P = 0.02 ) . BAER at 50/second revealed statistically significant relationships between HgB and the latency of wave VI ( P = 0.03 ) , and the I-VI interpeak interval ( P = 0.02 ) . Brainstem neural conduction times suggested that some of the Hg-intoxicated children in the study group have subtle neurophysiological anomalies that may be more manifest at higher BAER stimulus rates , and that the Hg-exposed children of gold miners are at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities .	11 1 122 12 112
20934951	BACKGROUND Most empirical estimates of human elimination kinetics for persistent chemicals reflect apparent elimination half-lives that represent the aggregated effect of intrinsic elimination , ongoing exposure , and changes in body weight . However , estimates of intrinsic elimination at background levels are required for risk assessments for the general population . OBJECTIVE To estimate intrinsic human elimination half-lives at background levels for nine polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners , we used a novel approach based on population data . METHODS We used a population pharmacokinetic model to interpret two sets of congener-specific cross-sectional age-concentration biomonitoring data of PCB concentrations measured in lipid and blood samples that were collected from 229 individuals in 1990 and 2003 . Our method is novel because it exploits information about changes in concentration in the human population along two dimensions : age and calendar time . RESULTS Our approach extracted information about both elimination kinetics and exposure trends from biomonitoring data . The longest intrinsic human elimination half-lives estimated in this study are 15.5 years for PCB-170 , 14.4 years for PCB-153 , and 11.5 years for PCB-180 . CONCLUSIONS Our results are further evidence that a maximum intrinsic elimination half-life for persistent chemicals such as PCBs exists and is approximately 10-15 years . A clear conceptual distinction between apparent and intrinsic half-lives is required to reduce the uncertainty in elimination half-lives of persistent chemicals . The method presented here estimates intrinsic elimination half-lives and the exposure trends of persistent pollutants using cross-sectional data available from a large and growing number of biomonitoring programs .	12 21 1 121 122 2
12559694	Styrene ( ST ) occurs ubiquitously in the environment and it is an important industrial chemical . After its uptake by the exposed mammalian organism , ST is oxidized to styrene-7,8-oxide ( SO ) by cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases . This reactive intermediate is further metabolized by epoxide hydrolase ( EH ) and glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) . In long-term animal studies , ST induced lung tumors in mice but not in rats . Considering the lung to be the relevant target organ for ST induced carcinogenicity in mice , we extended a previously developed physiological toxicokinetic model in order to simulate the lung burden with ST and SO in the ST exposed mouse , rat and human . The new model describes oral and pulmonary uptake of ST , its distribution into various tissues , its exhalation and its metabolism to SO in lung and liver . It also simulates the distribution of the produced SO into the tissues and its EH and GST mediated metabolism in liver and in lung . In both organs the ST induced GSH consumption is described together with the formation of adducts to hemoglobin and to DNA of lymphocytes in ST exposed mice , rats and humans . The model includes compartments for arterial , venous and pulmonary blood , liver , muscle , fat , richly perfused tissues and lung . The latter organ is represented by two compartments , namely by the conducting and the alveolar zone . The physiological description of the pulmonary compartments relies on measured alveolar retentions , literature values of surface area of capillary endothelium , of the thickness of the tissue ' air-to-plasma ' , of the partition coefficient lung:blood and of metabolic parameters of ST and SO measured in pulmonary cell fractions of rodents and humans . Simulations of average pulmonary GSH levels in ST exposed rodents agree with measured data . The model predicts a significant GSH depletion ( 40% ) in the conducting zone of mice exposed for 6 h to a ST concentration of only 20 ppm . In the conducting zone of rats , exposure to 200 ppm ST results in a loss of GSH of about 15% only . In humans , a pulmonary GSH reduction does not occur . The highest average pulmonary SO concentrations are predicted for mice , somewhat lower values for rats and by far the lowest ones for humans . Following steady state exposure to 20 ppm ST , the average SO concentration in mouse lungs is expected to be only three times higher than in rats . This difference diminishes to a factor of less than two at 70 ppm . In humans exposed to 20 ppm ST for 8 h , the average pulmonary SO burden of 0.016 micromol/kg is predicted to be about 17 and 50 times smaller than the corresponding values for rat and mouse . In agreement with reported values , pulmonary DNA adduct levels in rodents exposed to 160 ppm ST were simulated to be similar in rats and mice . In summary , there was no dramatic difference in the calculated average pulmonary SO burden between both animal species . However , pulmonary GSH loss was by far more expressed in ST exposed mice than rats . Since the model was validated on all available ST/SO data in mice , rats and humans , we consider it to be useful for estimating the risk resulting from exposure to ST .	2 21
20923744	BACKGROUND Oxidative damage to placental DNA can result in negative pregnancy outcomes , including intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) and low birth weight ( LBW ) . OBJECTIVE We investigated associations between the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2Â´-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodG ) , a marker of oxidative DNA damage , in placental DNA , exposure to air pollutants during pregnancy , genetic polymorphisms in 94 selected genes , and pregnancy outcomes . METHODS We studied 891 newborns who were IUGR- or LBW-affected or normal weight and were born between 1994 and 1999 in the Czech Republic in two districts with different levels of air pollution . RESULTS We found nonsignificantly elevated 8-oxodG levels in the IUGR-affected group compared with the non-IUGR group ( p = 0.055 ) . Similarly , slightly elevated 8-oxodG levels were found in the LBW-affected group compared with the non-LBW group ( p &lt ; 0.050 ) . In univariate analyses , we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with 8-oxodG levels , IUGR , and LBW . Exposure to particulate matter &lt ; 2.5 Âµm was associated with increased 8-oxodG levels in placental DNA and LBW . However , multivariate-adjusted logistic regression revealed that above-median 8-oxodG levels were the only factor significantly associated with IUGR [ OR = 1.56 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.07-2.37 ; p = 0.022 ] . Above-median levels of 8-oxodG were associated with LBW ( OR = 1.88 ; 95% CI , 1.15-3.06 ; p = 0.011 ) . Other variables associated with LBW included sex and gestational age of the newborn , maternal smoking , and haplotypes in the promoter region of the gene encoding mannose-binding lectin 2 ( MBL2 ) . The role of air pollutants in the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes seemed to be less important . CONCLUSIONS Levels of 8-oxodG in placental DNA were associated with the risk of IUGR as well as LBW . Newborn's sex , gestational age , maternal smoking , and genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region of the MBL2 gene were associated with LBW incidence .	11 1111 23 1 11122 2 111 1114 112 1112
22579118	We undertook a community-level aggregate analysis in South Carolina , USA , to examine associations between mother-child conditions from a Medicaid cohort of pregnant women and their children using spatially interpolated arsenic ( As ) and lead ( Pb ) concentrations in three geographic case areas and a control area . Weeks of gestation at birth was significantly negatively correlated with higher estimated As ( r(s) = -0.28 , p = 0.01 ) and Pb ( r(s) = -0.26 , p = 0.02 ) concentrations in one case area . Higher estimated Pb concentrations were consistently positively associated with frequency of black mothers ( all p &lt ; 0.02 ) and negatively associated with frequency of white mothers ( all p &lt ; 0.01 ) , suggesting a racial disparity with respect to Pb .	1 11 2 112
12661181	Arsenic is a known carcinogen , but data are especially lacking on the health effects of low-level exposure , and on the health significance of methylation ability . We conducted a case-control study ( 76 cases and 224 controls from 1996 to 1999 ) in southwestern Taiwan to explore the association among primary and secondary arsenic methylation index ( PMI and SMI , respectively ) , cumulative arsenic exposure ( CAE ) , and the risk of skin cancer . As compared with the controls , the skin cancer group reported more sun exposure ( P = 0.02 ) and had a lower BMI ( P = 0.03 ) , as well as lower education level ( P = 0.01 ) . Skin cancer patients and controls were similar with regard to age , gender , smoking and alcohol consumption . Given a low SMI ( &lt ; or = 5 ) , CAE &gt ; 15 mg/L-year was associated with an increased risk of skin cancer ( OR , 7.48 ; 95% CI , 1.65-33.99 ) compared to a CAE &lt ; or = 2 mg/L-year . Given the same level of PMI , SMI , and CAE , men had a higher risk of skin cancer ( OR , 4.04 ; 95% CI , 1.46-11.22 ) when compared to women . Subjects with low SMI and high CAE have a substantially increased risk of skin cancer . Males in all strata of arsenic exposure and methylation ability had a higher risk of skin cancer than women .	1 1111 2 111 11
19515364	BACKGROUND Information on the impact of genetic predisposition on metal toxicokinetics in the human body is limited . There is increasing evidence that certain genetic polymorphisms modify lead and mercury toxicokinetics . This called for analysis of further candidate genes . OBJECTIVES Medical students ( N=324 ) were examined in order to detect potential associations between lead exposure and polymorphisms in HFE , VDR , ALAD , and MT genes , as well as between mercury exposure and GSTT1 , GSTM1 , GSTA1 , GSTP1 , GCLC , and MT polymorphisms . METHODS The levels of lead and mercury exposure of students were determined by blood , urine , and hair analyses ( ICP-MS , CV-AAS ) . Genotyping of common polymorphisms was examined by MALDI-TOF MS and the TaqMan methodology . Associations between lead and mercury exposures and genetic background were examined by bivariate analysis , and by categorical regression analysis ( CATREG ) controlled by metal- and matrix-specific variables . RESULTS Lead and mercury levels in urine , blood , and hair indicated low exposures . VDR polymorphism and joint presence of VDR/ALAD polymorphisms were significantly and independently associated with urine lead concentrations ( CATREG P&lt;0.05 ) . Polymorphisms in GSTP1-114 and MT4 genes as well as dual gene combinations including GSTP1 , GCLC , GSTT1 , and GSTM1 polymorphisms were independent variables related to mercury body burdens ( CATREG P&lt;0.05 ) . GSTP1-114/GSTT1 and GSTP1-105/GCLC combinations showed synergistic effects on hair mercury levels compared to single-gene variants . CONCLUSIONS We found evidence that certain genetic backgrounds were associated with lead and mercury metabolism , suggesting gene-environment and gene-gene-environment interactions . The modes of interaction remain to be evaluated .	1 122 12 127 123
22579217	Road dust , household total suspended particulate matters ( TSP ) and PMâ.â  were collected in urban area of Guangzhou , south of China , to investigate the concentrations of total mercury ( THg ) and methyl mercury ( MeHg ) . The household PMâ.â  concentrations varied between 16.2 and 623 Î¼g/mÂ³ . The average PMâ.â  level ( 174 Î¼g/mÂ³ ) from all of the locations exceeded 24-h concentration from WHO air quality guideline The average concentrations of THg and MeHg were : 235 Î¼g/kg and 0.392 Î¼g/kg in road dust , 600 Î¼g/kg and 1.49 Î¼g/kg in TSP ; 1006 Î¼g/kg ( 104 pg/mÂ³ ) and 1.40 Î¼g/kg ( 0.134 pg/mÂ³ ) in PMâ.â  . Risk assessment showed that the Hazardous quotients ( HQs ) of exposure to Hg and MeHg via road dust and TSP were less than 1 , indicating that no adverse risk was manifested . Ingestion of dust was found to constitute a relatively minor pathway of Guangzhou residents ' exposure to Hg . Furthermore , human hair samples from 88 Guangzhou citizens were also analyzed to investigate the mercury accumulation in human body in Guangzhou . The average concentrations of THg and MeHg in human hair samples were 869Â±831 Î¼g/kg and 104Â±108 Î¼g/kg respectively . However , no significant correlations of the mercury species were noted between human hair and road dust , TSP and PMâ.â  .	24 12 23 1 123 242 2 232
20889376	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES We applied an updated hybrid approach to estimate the benchmark doses ( BMD ) and their 95% lower confidence limits ( BMDL ) for cadmium-induced renal effects as the threshold of urinary cadmium in humans . Using this method , the BMD and BMDL were estimated based on continuous exposure and continuous effect marker , thereby avoiding categorization of subjects , an inevitable outcome of previously used approaches . METHODS The target subjects were 547 men and 723 women , aged 50 years or older , who lived in a cadmium non-polluted area of Japan . We measured urinary cadmium ( U-Cd ) as a marker of long-term exposure , and urinary protein , Î²2-microglobulin ( Î²2-MG ) and N-acetyl-Î²-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) as renal effect markers . BMD and BMDL corresponding to an additional risk ( BMR ) of 5% , were calculated with the background risk at zero exposure set at 5% . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The BMDL of U-Cd for renal effect markers were 2.1 ( urinary protein ) , 2.6 ( Î²2-MG ) and 4.1 ( NAG ) Î¼g/g creatinine in men and 1.5 ( urinary protein ) , 1.4 ( Î²2-MG ) and 3.1 ( NAG ) Î¼g/g creatinine in women . The BMDLs in the present study may contribute to further discussion on health risk assessment of cadmium exposure , when compared to BMDLs obtained by previously reported methods .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
12661183	Perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride ( POSF , C8F17SO2F ) is used to create applications for surfactants and paper , packaging , and surface ( e.g. , carpets , textiles ) protectants . Such POSF-based products or their residuals may degrade or metabolize to PFOS ( C8F17SO3- ) . PFOS concentrates in liver and serum and results in hypolipidemia as an early effect of cumulative dosages . Male and female employees of two perfluorooctanyl-manufacturing locations ( Antwerp , Belgium and Decatur , Alabama ) participated in a periodic medical surveillance program that included hematology , clinical chemistry , thyroid hormone , and urinalysis testing . Serum concentrations of PFOS and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA , C7F15CO2- , used as a fluoropolymer emulsifier ) were measured via mass spectrometry methods . The mean serum PFOS and PFOA concentrations for 263 Decatur employees were 1.32 parts per million ( ppm ; geometric mean 0.91 , range 0.06-10.06 ppm ) and 1.78 ppm ( geometric mean 1.13 , range 0.04-12.70 ppm ) , respectively . Mean concentrations were approximately 50% lower among 255 Antwerp workers . Adjusting for potential confounding factors , there were no substantial changes in hematological , lipid , hepatic , thyroid , or urinary parameters consistent with the known toxicological effects of PFOS or PFOA in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses of the workers ' measured serum fluorochemical concentrations .	11 12 1 11121 122 1112 111
12663187	The province of Guizhou in Southwestern China is currently one of the world's most important mercury production areas . Emissions of mercury from the province to the global atmosphere have been estimated to be approximately 12% of the world total anthropogenic emissions . The main objective of this study was to assess the level of contamination with Hg in two geographical areas of Guizhou province . Mercury pollution in the areas concerned originates from mercury mining and ore processing in the area of Wanshan , while in the area of Quingzhen mercury pollution originates from the chemical industry discharging Hg through wastewaters and emissions to the atmosphere due to coal burning for electricity production . The results of this study confirmed high contamination with Hg in soil , sediments and rice in the Hg mining area in Wanshan . High levels of Hg in soil and rice were also found in the vicinity of the chemical plant in Quingzhen . The concentrations of Hg decreased with distance from the main sources of pollution considerably . The general conclusion is that Hg contamination in Wanshan is geographically more widespread , due to deposition and scavenging of Hg from contaminated air and deposition on land . In Quingzhen Hg contamination of soil is very high close to the chemical plant but the levels reach background concentrations at a distance of several km . Even though the major source of Hg in both areas is inorganic Hg , it was observed that active transformation of inorganic Hg to organic Hg species ( MeHg ) takes place in water , sediments and soils . The concentration of Hg in rice grains can reach up to 569 microg/kg of total Hg of which 145 microg/kg was in MeHg form . The percentage of Hg as MeHg varied from 5 to 83% . The concentrations of selenium can reach up to 16 mg/kg in soil and up to 1 mg/g in rice . A correlation exists between the concentration of Se in soil and rice , indicating that a portion of Se is bioavailable to plants . No correlation between Hg and Se in rice was found . Exposure of the local population to Hg may occur due to inhalation of Hg present in air ( in particular in Hg mining area ) and consumption of Hg contaminated food ( in particular rice and fish ) and water . Comparison of intake through these different routes showed that the values of Hg considerably exceed the USA EPA Reference Concentration ( RfC ) for chronic Hg exposure ( RfC is 0.0004 mg/m(3) ) close to the emission sources . Intake of Hg through food consumption , particularly rice and fish , is also an important route of Hg exposure in study area . In general , it can be concluded that the population mostly at risk is located in the vicinity of smelting facilities , mining activities and close to the waste disposal sites in the wider area of Wanshan . In order to assess the real level of contamination in the local population , it is recommended that biomonitoring should be performed , including Hg and MeHg measurements in hair , blood and urine samples .	24 2 232 243 23
22582496	BACKGROUND Psoriasis is a noncontagious , chronic skin disease affecting 1 in 50 people worldwide . METHODS The aim of present study was to compare the levels of arsenic ( As ) and selenium ( Se ) in samples of whole blood , urine , and scalp hair of 418 psoriasis patients of both genders aged 25 - 55 years . All psoriatic patients lived in the vicinity of a cement factory , and were categorized as mild , moderate , and severe . For comparison purposes , 395 healthy age-matched referent/control subjects , residents of industrial and non-industrial areas , were selected . The concentrations of essential trace and toxic elements were measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy after microwave-assisted acid digestion . The validity and accuracy of methodology was checked by using certified reference materials ( CRMs ) and the conventional wet acid digestion method on the same CRMs and real samples . RESULTS The observed mean values of As were significantly higher in scalp hair , blood , and urine samples of patients with mild and severe psoriasis as compared to the controls ( p = 0.01 - 0.001 ) , while the concentrations of Se were lower in the scalp hair and blood , but higher in the urine samples of psoriasis patients of all categories . CONCLUSIONS The deficiency of Se in psoriatic patients may undoubtedly be caused by the toxic element exposures via dust produced by the cement factory .	1 122 12 127 123
19452922	Manganese exposure and biomarker concentrations during early pregnancy and lactation were investigated in 408 women living in an area with elevated concentrations of both arsenic and manganese in drinking water derived from wells . About 40% of the water samples had manganese concentrations above the World Health Organization's guideline value and showed a strong inverse correlation with arsenic concentrations . Water manganese was found to correlate to urine concentrations , but not to blood or breast milk concentrations . No correlations were found among manganese concentrations in urine , blood , or breast milk . Compared to other populations , manganese concentrations in both urine and blood , but not breast milk , were elevated in the Bangladeshi women and more similar to those of occupationally exposed groups . The lack of associations with water manganese is likely due to variable exposure via water and food , and differences in bioavailability , as well as a complex and/or strict regulation of intestinal manganese absorption , in turn being influenced by nutritional as well as physiological and genetic factors . The results indicate that elevated maternal manganese exposure does not necessarily lead to exposure of breast-fed infants , stressing the importance of breast feeding in high manganese areas . However , the implications of fetal exposurefrom elevated maternal exposure need further investigation .	1 122 12 124 127
20870568	BACKGROUND Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a chronic disease of unclear etiology , characterized by an overactive immune system and the production of antibodies that may target normal tissues of many organ systems , including the kidneys . It can arise at any age and occurs mainly in women . OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate the potential influence of particulate matter ( PM ) air pollution on clinical aspects of SLE . METHODS We studied a clinic cohort of SLE patients living on the island of Montreal , followed annually with a structured clinical assessment . We assessed the association between ambient levels of fine PM [ median aerodynamic diameter â¤ 2.5 Î¼m ( PM2.5) ] measured at fixed-site monitoring stations and SLE disease activity measured with the SLE Disease Activity Index , version 2000 ( SLEDAI-2K ) , which includes anti-double-stranded DNA ( anti-dsDNA ) serum-specific autoantibodies and renal tubule cellular casts in urine , which reflects serious renal inflammation . We used mixed effects regression models that we adjusted for daily ambient temperatures and ozone levels . RESULTS We assessed 237 patients ( 223 women ) who together had 1,083 clinic visits from 2000 through 2007 ( mean age at time of first visit , 41.2 years ) . PM2.5 levels were associated with anti-dsDNA and cellular casts . The crude and adjusted odds ratios ( reflecting a 10-Î¼g/m3 increase in PM2.5 averaged over the 48 hr prior to clinical assessment ) were 1.26 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.96-1.65 ] and 1.34 ( 95% CI , 1.02-1.77 ) for anti-dsDNA antibodies and 1.43 ( 95% CI , 1.05-1.95 ) and 1.28 ( 0.92-1.80 ) for cellular casts . The total SLEDAI-2K scores were not associated with PM2.5 levels . CONCLUSIONS We provide novel data that suggest that short-term variations in air pollution may influence disease activity in established autoimmune rheumatic disease in humans . Our results add weight to concerns that pollution may be an important trigger of inflammation and autoimmunity .	11 23 231 1 1113 11123 111 2 1112
22619491	Neurodevelopment as Gesell development scores ( GDSs ) in relation to mercury exposure in infants ( &lt;6 months of age ) of one urban center and two rural villages , respectively , of fisherman and cassiterite miners . Mean total hair-Hg ( HHg ) concentrations of infants from ItapuÃ£ ( 3.95 Â± 1.8âppm ) were statistically ( P = 0.0001 ) different from those of infants from Porto Velho ( 3.84 Â± 5.5âppm ) and Bom Futuro ( 1.85 Â± 0.9âppm ) . Differences in vaccine coverage among these populations resulted in significantly higher ( P = 0.0001 ) mean ethylmercury ( EtHg ) exposure in urban infants ( 150âÎ¼g ) than in infants from either village ( 41.67âÎ¼g , ItapuÃ£ ; 42.39âÎ¼g , Bom Futuro ) . There was an inverse significant ( Spearman r = -0.2300 ; P = 0.0376 ) correlation between HHg and GDS for infants from Porto Velho , but not for the rural infants from Bom Futuro ( Spearman r = 0.1336 ; P = 0.0862 ) and ItapuÃ£ ( Spearman r = 0.1666 ; P = 0.5182 ) . Logistic regression applied to variables above or below the median GDS showed that EtHg exposure ( estimated probability = -0.0157 ; P = 0.0070 ) and breastfeeding score ( estimated probability = -0.0066 ; P = 0.0536 ) score were significantly associated with GDS . Conclusion . In nurslings whose mothers are exposed to different levels of fish-MeHg ( HHg ) , a higher score of neurological development at six months was negatively associated with exposure to additional TCV-EtHg . Results should be interpreted with caution because of unaccounted variables .	11 1 123 12 112
20843552	INTRODUCTION Polyfluoroalkyl chemicals ( PFCs ) are commercially synthesized chemicals used in consumer products . Exposure to certain PFCs is widespread , and some PFCs may act as endocrine disruptors . We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( ALSPAC ) in the United Kingdom to conduct a nested case-control study examining the association between age at menarche , and exposure to PFCs during pregnancy . METHODS Cases were selected from female offspring in the ALSPAC who reported menarche before the age of 11.5 years ( n = 218 ) , and controls were a random sample of remaining girls ( n = 230 ) . Serum samples taken from the girls ' mothers during pregnancy ( 1991-1992 ) were analyzed using on-line solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for 8 PFCs . Logistic regression was used to determine association between maternal serum PFC concentrations , and odds of earlier age at menarche . RESULTS PFOS and PFOA were the predominant PFCs ( median serum concentrations of 19.8 ng/mL and 3.7 ng/mL ) . All but one PFC were detectable in most samples . Total PFC concentration varied by number of births ( inverse association with birth order ; p-value &lt ; 0.0001 ) and race of the child ( higher among whites ; p-value = 0.03 ) . The serum concentrations of carboxylates were associated with increased odds of earlier age at menarche ; concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonamide , the sulfonamide esters and sulfonates were all associated with decreased odds of earlier age at menarche . However , all confidence intervals included the null value of 1.0 . CONCLUSIONS ALSPAC study participants had nearly ubiquitous exposure to most PFCs examined , but PFC exposure did not appear to be associated with altered age at menarche of their offspring .	11 1 122 12 112
19419713	A significant proportion of groundwater in south Asia is contaminated with arsenic . Pakistan has low levels of arsenic in groundwater compared with China , Bangladesh and India . A representative multi-stage cluster survey conducted among 3874 persons &gt ; or = 15 years of age to determine the prevalence of arsenic skin lesions , its relation with arsenic levels and cumulative arsenic dose in drinking water in a rural district ( population : 1.82 million ) in Pakistan . Spot-urine arsenic levels were compared among individuals with and without arsenic skin lesions . In addition , the relation of age , body mass index , smoking status with arsenic skin lesions was determined . The geographical distribution of the skin lesions and arsenic-contaminated wells in the district were ascertained using global positioning system . The total arsenic , inorganic and organic forms , in water and spot-urine samples were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry . The prevalence of skin lesions of arsenic was estimated for complex survey design , using surveyfreq and surveylogistic options of SAS 9.1 software.The prevalence of definitive cases i.e. hyperkeratosis of both palms and soles , was 3.4 per 1000 and suspected cases i.e. any sign of arsenic skin lesions ( melanosis and/or keratosis ) , were 13.0 per 1000 among &gt ; or = 15-year-old persons in the district . Cumulative arsenic exposure ( dose ) was calculated from levels of arsenic in water and duration of use of current drinking water source . Prevalence of skin lesions increases with cumulative arsenic exposure ( dose ) in drinking water and arsenic levels in urine . Skin lesions were 2.5-fold among individuals with BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m2 . Geographically , more arsenic-contaminated wells and skin lesions were alongside Indus River , suggests a strong link between arsenic contamination of groundwater with proximity to river.This is the first reported epidemiological and clinical evidence of arsenic skin lesions due to groundwater in Pakistan . Further investigations and focal mitigation measures for arsenic may be carried out alongside Indus River .	11 24 12 127 1 2 241 112
12738198	An investigation of arsenic , copper , nickel , manganese , zinc and selenium concentration in foodstuffs and drinking water , collected from 34 families and estimation of the average daily dietary intake were carried out in the arsenic-affected areas of the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , Murshidabad district , West Bengal where arsenic-contaminated groundwater ( mean : 0.11 mg/l , n=34 ) is the main source for drinking . The shallow large diameter tubewells , installed for agricultural irrigation contain an appreciable amount of arsenic ( mean : 0.094 mg/l , n=10 ) . So some arsenic can be expected in the food chain and food cultivated in this area . Most of the individual food composites contain a considerable amount of arsenic . The mean arsenic levels in food categories are vegetables ( 20.9 and 21.2 microg/kg ) , cereals and bakery goods ( 130 and 179 microg/kg ) and spices ( 133 and 202 microg/kg ) for the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively . For all other heavy metals , the observed mean concentration values are mostly in good agreement with the reported values around the world ( except higher zinc in cereals ) . The provisional tolerable daily intake value of inorganic arsenic microg/kg body wt./day ) is : for adult males ( 11.8 and 9.4 ) ; adult females ( 13.9 and 11 ) ; and children ( 15.3 and 12 ) in the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively ( according to FAO/WHO report , the value is 2.1 microg/kg body wt./day ) . According to WHO , intake of 1.0 mg of inorganic arsenic per day may give rise to skin lesions within a few years . The average daily dietary intake of copper , nickel and manganese is high , whereas for zinc , the value is low ( for adult males : 8.34 and 10.2 mg/day ; adult females : 8.26 and 10.3 mg/day ; and children : 4.59 and 5.66 mg/day ) in the Jalangi and Domkal blocks , respectively , compared to the recommended dietary allowance of zinc for adult males , adult females and children ( 15 , 12 and 10 mg/day , respectively ) . The average daily dietary intake of selenium microg/kg body wt./day ) is on the lower side for the children ( 1.07 and 1.22 ) , comparable for the adult males ( 0.81 and 0.95 ) and slightly on the higher side for the adult females ( 1.08 and 1.26 ) , compared to the recommended value ( 1.7 and 0.9 microg/kg body wt./day for infants and adults , respectively ) .	24 2 241 243
19394668	UNLABELLED PCB exposure has been associated with increased risk for cancer , neurological disease , and for birth defects in children exposed in utero . Because of the long half-lives of PCB congeners , they remain a public health problem in the United States 30 years after being banned . Workers ( n=3569 ) at an Indiana capacitor manufacturing plant were exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) from 1957 to 1977 . The purpose of this work was to develop a period-specific job-exposure matrix ( JEM ) for a follow-up epidemiologic study investigating the increased risks for cancer previously observed in the cohort . METHODS We used eight exposure determinants to estimate PCB exposures systematically . Work history , job description , capacitor production factors , PCB usage trends , and air sample data were used to develop the JEM in four steps : ( 1 ) all job titles ( n=884 ) were assessed for exposure determinants , ( 2 ) jobs with similar exposure determinants were grouped , ( 3 ) for each job exposure category , exposure intensity ( high-medium-low-background ) and frequency ( continuous-intermittent ) were qualitatively rated separately for inhalation and dermal exposure , and ( 4 ) for each job exposure category , the product of intensity ( based on air sampling data ) and frequency ( fraction of day exposed ) was calculated . The JEM was then modified for two eras of different PCB exposure conditions . RESULTS The resulting JEM consists of inhalation and dermal exposure values for 19 job exposure categories . CONCLUSION The JEM showed an exposure-response trend associated with increased brain cancer mortality in the epidemiologic study .	232 2 21 22 23
20714930	This study aimed to determine the levels of placental cadmium ( PCd ) and cord blood cadmium ( CBCd ) and the resulting expression of placental metallothionein ( MT ) in neonates and to investigate cadmium ( Cd ) exposure levels in neonates and mothers who live in Guiyu , China , an electronic waste ( e-waste ) pollution site . Among the 423 mothers included in the study from 2004/2005 to 2007 , 289 lived in Guiyu ( exposed group ) and 134 lived in Chaonan , located 10 km away from Guiyu ( controls ) and had never been exposed to e-waste pollution . CBCd and PCd levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry . Placental MT was examined by immunohistochemistry . Information on maternal and neonatal characteristics and exposure conditions was obtained from hospital records and by personal interviews . For the 3 years , the median CBCd was higher for Guiyu neonates than for controls ( 3.61 vs. 1.25 Î¼g/L ) , with 25.61% of Guiyu subjects exhibiting a median CBCd that exceeded the safety limit defined by the World Health Organization ( 5 Î¼g/L ) , as compared with 14.18% of control neonates ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) . In Guiyu , the mean PCd was higher than that for controls ( 0.17 Â± 0.48 vs. 0.10 Â± 0.11 Î¼g/g , p â¤ 0.01 ) . The high levels of CBCd and PCd were significantly associated with parents ' occupational and environmental exposure to e-waste recycling pollutants . Staining for MT was positive and dense for 67.00% ( 67/100 ) of Guiyu neonates as compared with 32.69% ( 17/52 ) of controls ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) . Exposure to e-waste recycling pollutants increased Cd exposure in neonates , which was accompanied by increased placental MT expression .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 126 1112
19351571	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are lipophilic , persistent pollutants found worldwide in environmental and human samples . Exposure pathways for PBDEs remain unclear but may include food , air and dust . The aim of this study was to conduct an integrated assessment of PBDE exposure and human body burden using 10 matched samples of human milk , indoor air and dust collected in 2007-2008 in Brisbane , Australia . In addition , temporal analysis was investigated comparing the results of the current study with PBDE concentrations in human milk collected in 2002-2003 from the same region . PBDEs were detected in all matrices and the median concentrations of BDEs -47 and -209 in human milk , air and dust were : 4.2 and 0.3 ng/g lipid ; 25 and 7.8 pg/m(3) ; and 56 and 291 ng/g dust , respectively . Significant correlations were observed between the concentrations of BDE-99 in air and human milk ( r=0.661 , p=0.038 ) and BDE-153 in dust and BDE-183 in human milk ( r=0.697 , p=0.025 ) . These correlations do not suggest causal relationships - there is no hypothesis that can be offered to explain why BDE-153 in dust and BDE-183 in milk are correlated . The fact that so few correlations were found in the data could be a function of the small sample size , or because additional factors , such as sources of exposure not considered or measured in the study , might be important in explaining exposure to PBDEs . There was a slight decrease in PBDE concentrations from 2002-2003 to 2007-2008 but this may be due to sampling and analytical differences . Overall , average PBDE concentrations from these individual samples were similar to results from pooled human milk collected in Brisbane in 2002-2003 indicating that pooling may be an efficient , cost-effective strategy of assessing PBDE concentrations on a population basis . The results of this study were used to estimate an infant's daily PBDE intake via inhalation , dust ingestion and human milk consumption . Differences in PBDE intake of individual congeners from the different matrices were observed . Specifically , as the level of bromination increased , the contribution of PBDE intake decreased via human milk and increased via dust . As the impacts of the ban of the lower brominated ( penta- and octa-BDE ) products become evident , an increased use of the higher brominated deca-BDE product may result in dust making a greater contribution to infant exposure than it does currently . To better understand human body burden , further research is required into the sources and exposure pathways of PBDEs and metabolic differences influencing an individual's response to exposure . In addition , temporal trend analysis is necessary with continued monitoring of PBDEs in the human population as well as in the suggested exposure matrices of food , dust and air .	24 12 23 1 2 124 243 242 232
22713347	OBJECTIVE To reduce arsenic ( As ) exposure , we evaluated the effectiveness of training community members to perform water arsenic ( WAs ) testing and provide As education compared to sending representatives from outside communities to conduct these tasks . METHODS We conducted a cluster based randomized controlled trial of 20 villages in Singair , Bangladesh . Fifty eligible respondents were randomly selected in each village . In 10 villages , a community member provided As education and WAs testing . In a second set of 10 villages an outside representative performed these tasks . RESULTS Overall , 53% of respondents using As contaminated wells , relative to the Bangladesh As standard of 50âÎ¼g/L , at baseline switched after receiving the intervention . Further , when there was less than 60% arsenic contaminated wells in a village , the classification used by the Bangladeshi and UNICEF , 74% of study households in the community tester villages , and 72% of households in the outside tester villages reported switching to an As safe drinking water source . Switching was more common in the outside-tester ( 63% ) versus community-tester villages ( 44% ) . However , after adjusting for the availability of arsenic safe drinking water sources , well switching did not differ significantly by type of As tester ( Odds ratio = 0.86[95% confidence interval 0.42-1.77 ) . At follow-up , among those using As contaminated wells who switched to safe wells , average urinary As concentrations significantly decreased . CONCLUSION The overall intervention was effective in reducing As exposure provided there were As-safe drinking water sources available . However , there was not a significant difference observed in the ability of the community and outside testers to encourage study households to use As-safe water sources . The findings of this study suggest that As education and WAs testing programs provided by As testers , irrespective of their residence , could be used as an effective , low cost approach to reduce As exposure in many As-affected areas of Bangladesh .	24 12 1 2 241 127
22713597	Prenatal arsenic exposure is associated with increased infant morbidity and reduced thymus size , indicating arsenic-related developmental immunotoxicity . We aimed to evaluate effects of prenatal arsenic exposure on thymic function at birth and related mechanisms of action . In a Bangladeshi cohort , arsenic was measured in urine ( U-As , gestational week ( GW ) 8 and 30 ) and blood ( B-As , GW14 ) in 130 women . Child thymic index was measured by sonography at birth and thymic function by signal-joint T-cell receptor-rearrangement excision circles ( sjTRECs ) in cord blood mononuclear cells ( CBMC ) . In a subsample ( n = 44 ) , sjTRECs content in isolated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells , expression of oxidative-stress defense and apoptosis-related genes in CBMC , arsenic concentrations ( urine , placenta , and cord blood ) , and oxidative stress markers in placenta and cord blood were measured . In multivariable-adjusted regression , ln U-As ( GW8 ) was inversely associated with ln sjTRECs in CBMC ( B = -0.25 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] -0.48 to -0.01 ) . Using multivariable-adjusted spline regression , ln U-As ( GW30 ) and ln B-As ( GW14 ) were inversely associated with ln sjTRECs in CBMC ( B = -0.53 ; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.13 and B = -1.27 ; 95% CI -1.89 to -0.66 , respectively ) below spline knots at U-As 150 Âµg/l and B-As 6 Âµg/kg . Similar inverse associations were observed in separated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells . Arsenic was positively associated with 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in cord blood ( B = 0.097 ; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.13 ) , which was inversely associated with sjTRECs in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells . In conclusion , prenatal arsenic exposure was associated with reduced thymic function , possibly via induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis , suggesting subsequent immunosuppression in childhood .	11 1111 12 127 11122 1 122 1112 111 1114 126 112
12738208	This study investigated commuter exposure to aromatic volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) in different commuting microenvironments . In Hong Kong , more than 90% of the local citizens rely on public transport facilities in their daily commutes . During five winter months in late 2001 and early 2002 , in-vehicle monitoring was performed in nine popular public transportation modes : tram , public light bus , air-conditioned bus , non-air-conditioned bus , taxi , ferry and three railway systems ( Mass Transit Railway-MTR , Kowloon-Canton Railway-KCR and Light Rail Transit-LRT ) . These transports were grouped into three categories : railway transport , roadway transport and marine transport . Air samples of benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene and m/p/o-xylene were collected by canisters and analysed by gas chromatography and mass selective detector technique . Results indicated that the in-vehicle VOC exposure levels were greatly influenced by the mode of transport . For benzene , mean concentration ranged from 4.8 to 6.1 microg x m(-3) in roadway transports , 3.0-3.8 microg x m(-3) in railway transports and it was 2.1 microg x m(-3) in ferry . Regardless of the results in MTR and air-conditioned buses , the VOC levels in roadway transport were the highest and was followed by railway transport . The exposure levels in marine transport were the lowest . The TEX concentrations were found to be substantially higher in air-conditioned buses and MTR trains than in other transports , suggesting the existence of additional solvent-related sources in their vehicle interiors . Measurements in non-air-conditioned double deck vehicles indicate that there was slightly higher VOC levels in the lower deck than in the upper deck microenvironment . The average upper to lower deck exposure ratio ranged from 0.79 to 0.87 in trams and 0.78-0.83 in non-air-conditioned buses , depending on the compound of concern . The VOC exposure levels of public transport commuters in Hong Kong are far lower than those in most oversea cities . The experimental concentrations obtained in this study are within the relevant health-protecting limits as stated in the Hong Kong Indoor Air Quality Objective . Influences of recent VOC pollution control measures and local traffic characteristics on in-vehicle level are discussed .	2 232 23
12785511	People driving in a vehicle might receive an enhanced dose of mobile source pollutants that are considered a potential risk for cardiovascular diseases . The exposure to components of air pollution in highway patrol vehicles , at an ambient , and a roadside location was determined during 25 work shifts ( 3 p.m. to midnight ) in the autumn of 2001 , each day with two cars . A global positioning system and a diary provided location and activity information . Average pollutant levels inside the cars were low compared to ambient air quality standards : carbon monoxide 2.7 ppm , nitrogen dioxide 41.7 microg/m3 , ozone 11.7 ppb , particulate matter smaller 2.5 microm ( PM2.5 ) 24 microg/m3 . Volatile organic compounds inside the cars were in the ppb-range and showed the fingerprint of gasoline . PM2.5 was 24% lower than ambient and roadside levels , probably due to depositions associated with the recirculating air conditioning . Levels of carbon monoxide , aldehydes , hydrocarbons , and some metals ( Al , Ca , Ti , V , Cr , Mn , Fe , Cu , and Sr ) were highest in the cars , and roadside levels were higher than ambient levels . Elevated pollutant levels were related to locations with high traffic volumes . Our results point to combustion engine emissions from other vehicles as important sources of air pollutants inside the car .	2 232 23
19252989	During the recent two decades , a remarkable drop in fertility rates has been noticed almost all over the world . A series of studies have showed that environmental factors had the primary role causing the observed adverse trends in the male reproductive health problems . Especially chlorinated hydrocarbons , for instance polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) and pesticides , could mimic or antagonize the effects of steroid hormones , like estrogens and androgens and possibly interfering with male reproductive capacity . Organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) ( i.e. p.p'-DDT , endosulfan... ) and PCBs are widespread used chemicals in agriculture and industry for different purposes all over the world . Although direct evidence is lacking , theoretical considerations and epidemiological evidence implicate these compounds as potential hazards to human and wildlife reproductive health . For this purpose , in this study adipose tissue samples have provided from healthy males which were diagnosed as infertile men living in Ankara , Turkey at least for 5 years . Residual levels of OCPs ( alpha-BHC , beta-BHC , gamma-BHC , HCB , Endosulfan I , II , p,p'-DDE , and p,p'-DDT ) and seven major persistent PCB congeners ( PCB 28 , 52 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) were measured in 25 infertile men and 21 healthy men's adipose tissue samples by GC-ECD . Levels of OCPs and PCBs in adipose tissue of infertile men compared with those provided from controls . When the concentrations of each of the OCP were compared between the fertile and infertile groups , no statistical significance was obtained . Concentrations of each of the PCB congeners were compared between the fertile and infertile groups , no statistical significance was obtained ( p &gt ; 0.05 ) , except for 2,2',5,5'-Tetrachlorobiphenyl ( PCB 52 ) ( p = 0.032 ) and 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl ( PCB 180 ) ( p = 0.017 ) .	1 121 12
12849688	Comparative evaluation was made on alpha(1)-microglobulin ( alpha(1)-MG ) , beta(2)-microglobulin ( beta(2)-MG ) , retinol binding protein ( RBP ) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , as a marker of renal tubular dysfunction after environmental exposure to cadmium ( Cd ) , with special references to the effects of aging and correction for creatinine concentration . For this purpose , a previously established database of 817 never-smoking Japanese women ( at the ages of 20 to 74 years ) on hematological [ hemoglobin , serum ferritin ( FE ) , etc. ] and urinary parameters [ alpha(1)-MG , beta(2)-MG , creatinine ( cr ) , and a specific gravity ] was revisited . For the present analysis , the database was supplemented by the data on RBP and NAG in urine . The exposure of the women to Cd was such that the geometric mean Cd in urine was 1.3 microg/g cr . Among the four tubular dysfunction markers , NAG showed the closest correlation with Cd , followed by alpha(1)-MG and then beta(2)-MG , and RBP was least so although the correlations were all statistically significant . The observed values of the markers gave the best results , whereas correction for a urine specific gravity gave poorer correlation , and it was the worst when correction for creatinine concentration was applied . Age was the most influential confounding factor . The effect of age appeared to be attributable at least in part to the fact that both creatinine and , to a lesser extent , the specific gravity decreased as a function of age . Iron deficiency anemia of sub-clinical degree as observed among the women did not affect any of the four tubular dysfunction markers . In conclusion , NAG and alpha(1)-MG , rather beta(2)-MG or RBP , are more sensitive to detect Cd-induced tubular dysfunction in mass screening . The use of uncorrected observed values of the markers rather than traditional creatinine-corrected values is recommended when comparison covers people of a wide range of ages .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
22821556	Risk assessments often do not quantify the risk associated with soil inhalation . This pathway generally makes a negligible contribution to the cumulative risk , because soil ingestion is typically the dominant exposure pathway . Conditions in northern or rural centers in Canada characterized by large areas of exposed soil , including unpaved roads , favor the resuspension of soil particles , making soil inhalation a relevant risk pathway . The authors determined and compared human exposure to metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) from soil ingestion and inhalation and analyzed the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks before and after roads were paved in a northern community . To determine the inhalation exposure , three size fractions of airborne particulate matter were collected ( total suspended particulates [ TSP ] , particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10âÂµm [ PM10 ] , and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5âÂµm [ PM2.5] ) before and after roads were paved . Road paving reduced the concentration of many airborne contaminants by 25 to 75% , thus reducing risk . For example , before paving , the carcinogenic risk associated with inhalation of Cr was 3.4 excess cancers per 100,000 people exposed , whereas after paving , this risk was reduced to 1.6 in 100,000 . Paving roads reduced the concentrations of total suspended particulates ( TSP ; pâ&lt;â0.1 ) and PM10 ( pâ&lt;â0.05 ) but not PM25 . Consequently , the ingestion of inhaled soil particles was substantially reduced . The authors conclude that resuspended soil is likely an important source of risk for many northern communities and that paving roads is an effective method of reducing risk from the inhalation of soil particles .	245 24 2 23
19178930	The breast milk concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ; sum of eight congeners : BDE-28 , 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , 183 and 209 ) were determined ( by high resolution gas chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometry ) in samples from primiparous women collected in 2006 in Tianjin , China . Dietary and lifestyle habits of the participants were obtained by questionnaires . The median total PBDE concentration ( including BDE-28 , 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , 183 ) was 2500 pg g(-1) lipid weight , ranging from 1700 to 4500 pg g(-1) lipid weight . These levels were in the same range as those from Europe and Japan but much lower than those from North America . The congener profile in China was also different from other countries . The contribution of BDE-28 was around 15% , much higher than any other country , implying that a different Penta-BDE formulation might be used in the Chinese market . The lower ratio of the sum of BDE-47 , 99 , and 100 to the sum of BDE-153 and 154 suggested that Octa-products were in more demand in China . A significant correlation was found between a woman's PBDE concentration and the time she used electronic appliances ( h/d ) . This implies that electronics are a potential source of PBDEs to people . Inhalation or ingestion of particulate matter ( such as dust ) may also be an important exposure pathway . There was no significant correlation between the PBDE concentration and the consumption of meat , fish , and milk . Further research is needed to determine the specific contribution of each exposure route and their health effects .	24 12 1 244 2 124 243
19155055	This paper discusses the dioxin TEQ levels as determined by the chemically activated luciferase gene expression assay ( CALUX ) and by HRGC-HRMS in eggs , soils , faeces and kitchen waste samples obtained in the CONTEGG study . The samples were collected in each Belgian province at private homes and in small gardens where chickens are held . The CALUX levels for eggs sampled in autumn were higher than the levels in eggs obtained at the same locations in spring ( median values of 5.86 and 4.08 pg CALUX TEQ/g fat , respectively ) . The total WHO-TEQ levels in eggs , determined by HRGC-HRMS , ranged from 3.29 to 95.35 pg TEQ/g fat in autumn and from 1.50 to 64.79 pg TEQ/g fat in spring . In the soils on which the chickens forage , levels of 2.51-11.35 pg I-TEQ/g in autumn and 2.00-7.86 pg I-TEQ/g in spring were found . The congener pattern of PCDD/Fs in the eggs , soils and faeces was dominated by OCDD , in addition to 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HeptaCDD , OCDF and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HeptaCDF . The predominant dioxin-like PCBs were PCB118 , PCB 105 and PCB 156 . The dioxin-like PCBs contributed on average 47% , 14% and 20% to the total WHO-TEQ in eggs , soils and faeces , respectively . Kitchen waste samples were very low-contaminated with dioxin-like compounds . The present results showed a good agreement between egg and soil TEQ levels for PCDD/Fs but not for dioxin-like PCBs . This study showed that current soil levels found in some private gardens do not lead to egg levels below the current EU maximal level of 6 pg total TEQ/g fat for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs . The consumers of the analysed eggs attained 5-79% of the tolerable weekly intake ( TWI ) of 14 pg TEQ/kg bw for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs by exposure to their home-produced eggs only .	24 2 243
23872245	Exposure to environmental pollutants has been recognised as a risk factor for cardiovascular events. 1-hydroxypyrene ( 1-OHP ) is a biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) from traffic-related air pollution . Experimental studies indicate that PAH exposure could be associated with inflammation and atherogenesis . Thus , the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the biomarker of PAH exposure is associated with biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress and if these effects modulate the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in workers exposed to air pollution . This study included 60 subjects , comprising 39 taxi drivers and 21 non-occupationally exposed persons . Environmental PM2.5 and benzo[a]pyrene ( BaP ) levels , in addition to biomarkers of exposure and oxidative damage , were determined . Inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1Î² , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-Î± , IFN-Î³ and hs-CRP ) and serum levels of oxidised LDL ( ox-LDL ) , auto-antibodies ( ox-LDL-Ab ) and homocysteine ( Hcy ) were also evaluated . PM2.5 and BaP exhibited averages of 12.4Â±6.9 Î¼g m(-3) and 1.0Â±0.6 ng m(-3) , respectively . Urinary 1-OHP levels were increased in taxi drivers compared to the non-occupationally exposed subjects ( p&lt;0.05 ) and were positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and negatively correlated with antioxidants . Furthermore , taxi drivers had elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines , biomarkers of oxidative damage , and ox-LDL , ox-LDL-Ab and Hcy levels , although antioxidant enzymes were decreased compared to the non-occupationally exposed subjects ( p&lt;0.05 ) . In summary , our findings indicate that taxi drivers showed major exposure to pollutants , such as PAHs , in relation to non-occupationally exposed subjects . This finding was associated with higher inflammatory biomarkers and Hcy , which represent important predictors for cardiovascular events . These data suggest a contribution of PAHs to cardiovascular diseases upon occupational exposure .	11 12 1 11121 11122 11123 111 1114 127 1112
18079760	Ascertaining the true risk associated with exposure to particulate matter ( PM ) is difficult , given the fact that pollutant components are frequently correlated with each other and with other gaseous pollutants ; relationships between ambient concentrations and personal exposures are often not well understood ; and PM , unlike its gaseous co-pollutants , does not represent a single chemical . In order to examine differences between observed versus true health risk estimate from epidemiologic studies , we conducted a simulation using data from a recent multi-pollutant exposure assessment study in Baltimore , MD . The objectives of the simulation were twofold : ( a ) to estimate the distribution of personal air pollutant exposures one might expect to observe within a population , given the corresponding ambient concentrations found in that location and ; ( b ) using an assumed true health risk with exposure to one pollutant , to estimate the distribution of health risk estimates likely to be observed in an epidemiologic study using ambient pollutant concentrations as a surrogate of exposure as compared with actual personal pollutant exposures . Results from the simulations showed that PM2.5 was the only pollutant where a true association with its total personal exposures resulted in a significant observed association with its ambient concentrations . The simulated results also showed that true health risks associated with personal exposure to O3 and NO2 would result in no significant observed associations with any of their respective ambient concentrations . Conversely , a true association with PM2.5 would result in a significant , observed association with NO2 ( beta=0.0115 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.0056 , 0.0185 ) and a true association with exposure to SO4(2-) would result in an observed significant association with O3 ( beta=0.0035 , 95% CI : 0.0021 , 0.0051 ) given the covariance of the ambient pollutant concentrations . The results provide an indication that , in Baltimore during this study period , ambient gaseous concentrations may not have been adequate surrogates for corresponding personal gaseous exposures to allow the question to be investigated using central site monitors . Alternatively , the findings may suggest that in some locations , observed associations with the gaseous pollutants should be interpreted with caution , as they may be reflecting associations with PM or one of its chemical components .	2 233 231 23
11226969	A significant association between ingested arsenic and bladder cancer has been reported in an arseniasis-endemic area in southwestern Taiwan , where many households share only a few wells in their villages . In another arseniasis-endemic area in northeastern Taiwan , each household has its own well for obtaining drinking water . In 1991-1994 , the authors examined risk of transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) in relation to ingested arsenic in a cohort of 8,102 residents in northeastern Taiwan . Estimation of each study subject's individual exposure to inorganic arsenic was based on the arsenic concentration in his or her own well water , which was determined by hydride generation combined with atomic absorption spectrometry . Information on duration of consumption of the well water was obtained through standardized questionnaire interviews . The occurrence of urinary tract cancers was ascertained by follow-up interview and by data linkage with community hospital records , the national death certification profile , and the cancer registry profile . Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate multivariate-adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals . There was a significantly increased incidence of urinary cancers for the study cohort compared with the general population in Taiwan ( standardized incidence ratio = 2.05 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.22 , 3.24 ) . A significant dose-response relation between risk of cancers of the urinary organs , especially TCC , and indices of arsenic exposure was observed after adjustment for age , sex , and cigarette smoking . The multivariate-adjusted relative risks of developing TCC were 1.9 , 8.2 , and 15.3 for arsenic concentrations of 10.1-50.0 , 50.1-100 , and &gt;100 microg/liter , respectively , compared with the referent level of &lt ; or =10.0 microg/liter .	24 2 241
23850662	Punjab state in India is an agrarian society , where agriculture is the lifeline of farming community . To keep pace with increasing demands of food for growing population the indiscriminate use of pesticides has led to the contamination of environment and food commodities in this region . Analysis of human breast milk samples ( n=53 ) for pesticide residues revealed the presence of Î²- , Î³-HCH , p,p ' DDD , p,p ' DDE , p,p ' DDT and endrin with mean concentration of 97.9 , 101.7 , 239.8 , 1574.1 , 100.3 and 90.7 ng g(-1) lipid wt. , respectively . In addition , occurrence of Î²-endosulfan , endosulfan sulphate , cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos in this study have also been reported for the first time in human breast milk in Punjab , India . With increase in parity , HCH and DDT residue burden in donor's milk decreased . Although levels of HCH and DDT residues in breast milk samples have decreased significantly , yet estimated daily intake values for DDT are higher than the FAO/WHO permissible tolerable daily intake values for few infants .	24 12 1 2 124 243
23841501	To investigate the hypothesis that general environmental arsenic ( As ) exposure can impair male fertility , we designed a case-control study examining possible correlations between the concentrations of different As species in urine [ controls ( n = 151 ) vs cases ( n = 140) ] , urinary metabolic biomarkers [ controls ( n = 158 ) vs cases ( n = 135) ] , and infertility characterized by poor semen quality . Regional participants were recruited sequentially from the affiliated hospitals of Nanjing Medical University . Elevated inorganic arsenate ( Asi(V) ) exposure was associated with infertility : in comparison with the first quartile , subjects with Asi(V) levels above the median were more likely to exhibit male idiopathic infertility with increasing adjusted odds ratios ( AOR ) of 4.9 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.8-13.6 ] and 13.6 ( 95% CI , 4.8-38.6 ) at the third and fourth quartiles ( P = 0.000 for trend ) , respectively . Other As species did not exhibit a significant dose-dependent correlation with infertility risk . Levels of urinary biomarkers correlated with both male infertility and Asi(V) concentrations [ controls ( n = 145 ) vs cases ( n = 123) ] ; the latter correlation was independent of disease . These included acylcarnitines , aspartic acid , and hydroxyestrone , which were negatively associated with infertility , and uridine and methylxanthine , which were positively associated . In conclusion , for the first time we show that elevated urinary concentrations of Asi(V) from general As exposure are significantly associated with male infertility , and As species may exert toxicity via oxidative stress and sexual hormone disrupting mechanisms , as indicated by related biomarkers .	11 1 127 12 112
11227634	Mercury exposure and health status were examined in 40 gold workers in the area surrounding El Callao , Venezuela . Concentrations of mercury in workplace air were measured on 3 successive days , and spot urine and hair samples were also taken for analysis . Subjects underwent a physical examination and completed a questionnaire regarding employment history , work activities involving mercury exposure , use of protective clothing and equipment , and frequency of 37 symptoms associated with mercury toxicity . A complete set of health data was collected for 29 of the subjects . Use of protective equipment was limited , and 17.9% , 24.1% , and 48.3% of subjects had mercury concentrations in air , hair , and urine , respectively , above contemporary occupational exposure guidelines . Physical examination found the workers to be generally healthy and without overt symptoms of mercury toxicity . The frequency of psychoneurological , gastrointestinal , cardio-respiratory , and dermal symptoms was unrelated to any of the measures of mercury exposure . Two subjects had modestly elevated urinary levels of N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminidase . Despite substantial occupational exposure to mercury among a number of the subjects , few adverse health effects were observed that were plausibly related to mercury .	11 12 23 127 1 123 111 11123 112 2 1112 232
17976230	BACKGROUND This study describes exposure levels of bakery and pastry apprentices to flour dust , a known risk factor of occupational asthma . METHODS Questionnaires on work activity were completed by 286 students . Among them , 34 performed a series of two personal exposure measurements using a PM2.5 and PM10 personal sampler during a complete work shift , one during a cold ( "winter" ) period , and the other during a hot ( "summer" ) period . RESULTS Bakery apprentices experience greater average PM2.5 and PM10 exposures than pastry apprentices ( p &lt ; 0.006 ) . Exposure values for both particulate fractions are greater in winter ( average PM10 values among bakers = 1.10 mg.m-3 [ standard deviation : 0.83] ) than in summer ( 0.63 mg.m-3 [ 0.36] ) . While complying with current European occupational limit values , these exposures exceed the ACGIH recommendations set to prevent sensitization to flour dust ( 0.5 mg.m-3 ) . Over half the facilities had no ventilation system . CONCLUSION Young bakery apprentices incur substantial exposure to known airways allergens , a situation that might elicit early induction of airways inflammation .	23 2 233
23827356	Methylmercury ( MeHg ) toxicity may vary widely despite similar levels of exposure . This is hypothetically related to genetic differences in enzymes metabolizing MeHg . MeHg causes oxidative stress in experimental models but little is known about its effects on humans . The aims of the present study was to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in glutathione ( GSH)-related genes ( GSTM1 , GSTT1 , GSTP1 and GCLM ) on Hg concentrations in blood and hair , as well as MeHg-related effects on catalase ( CAT ) and glutathione-peroxidase ( GPx ) activity and GSH concentrations . Study subjects were from an Amazonian population in Brazil chronically exposed to MeHg from fish . Hg in blood and hair were determined by ICP-MS , CAT , GPx and GSH were determined by spectrophotometry , and multiplex PCR ( GSTM1 and GSTT1 ) and TaqMan assays ( GSTP1 and GCLM ) were used for genotyping . Mean Hg concentrations in blood and hair were 48Â±36 Î¼g/L and 14Â±10 Î¼g/g . Persons with the GCLM-588 TT genotype had lower blood and hair Hg than did C-allele carriers ( linear regression for Hg in blood Î²=-0.32 , p=0.017 ; and hair Î²=-0.33 ; p=0.0090 ; adjusted for fish intake , age and gender ) . GSTM1*0 homozygous had higher blood ( Î²=0.20 ; p=0.017 ) and hair Hg ( hair Î²=0.20 ; p=0.013 ) . Exposure to MeHg altered antioxidant status ( CAT : Î²=-0.086 ; GSH : Î²=-0.12 ; GPx : Î²=-0.16 ; all p&lt;0.010 ; adjusted for gender , age and smoking ) . Persons with GSTM1*0 had higher CAT activity in the blood than those with GSTM1 . Our data thus indicate that some GSH-related polymorphisms , such as GSTM1 and GCLM may modify MeHg metabolism and Hg-related antioxidant effects .	11 12 1 122 123 111 1114 11123 1112
23016600	This study measured inhalation exposure to 13 volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) among workers in the leatherwear industry in Spain , examined the changes in those exposures over a 5-year period , and documented local exhaust ventilation practices that affected exposure . In collaboration with an occupational risk prevention company , air samples were collected from 849 workers ' personal breathing zones using personal air pumps with activated charcoal tubes . VOCs were analyzed using a GC/MS-optimized method modified in our laboratory from that proposed by Spanish authorities ( INSHT ) . Airborne concentrations were compared with occupational exposure limit ( OEL ) values from the European authorities . The most frequently detected VOCs were acetone ( 98.1% ) , toluene ( 94.8% ) , n-hexane ( 71.2% ) and other C6-C7 branched alkyl hydrocarbons ( 97.5% ) . Other frequently detected VOCs were MEK ( 64.9% ) , ethylacetate ( 60.7% ) , and cyclohexane ( 29.3% ) . Benzene was detected in 24.6% of samples . Although all the samples were taken while workers performed tasks judged to have the highest VOC exposure potential , only 14% of samples showed excessive aggregate exposure , and chemical-specific OELs were exceeded in a relatively small number of cases : 7.2% for n-hexane , 2.8% for toluene , 0.6% for acetone , and 0.4% for hexane isomers . Over the study period , a diminished use of n-hexane in solvent formulations and an increased use of branched hexane and heptane isomers were observed . Six factors relating to work location conditions and types were evaluated . Most high-exposure cases were associated with three task types . The presence of local exhaust ventilation was an important exposure control , but significant exposures despite the use of local exhaust were observed . Although n-hexane exposures significantly decreased over the study period , the overall level of VOC exposure did not decrease . More effective exposure prevention measures need to be implemented .	23 2 233
11266324	Between September 1995 and September 1996 , 4-day composite duplicate plate samples ( 379 solid food samples and 303 beverage samples ) were obtained from a stratified random sample of 75 individuals in Maryland and analyzed for the presence of 10 pesticides . Samples were collected in each of six approximately equally spaced cycles as part of a larger pilot investigation of longitudinal exposure to pesticides and other elements . Chlorpyrifos was detected in 38.3% of the solid food samples , malathion in 75.2% , and p,p'-DDE in 21.4% . Other pesticides were detected in less than 10% of the solid food samples . Pesticide residues were not detected in duplicate beverage samples . In solid food samples , the mean concentration of chlorpyrifos was 0.7 ( SD 1.7 ) microg/kg , 1.8 ( 2.1 ) for malathion , and 0.2 ( 0.6 ) for p,p'-DDE . The detection rate and mean concentration of chlorpyrifos , malathion , and p,p'-DDE varied by a factor of 2-3 among sampling cycles and significantly according to results from several statistical analyses . Co-occurrence of chlorpyrifos and malathion in solid food samples was found relatively frequently and also varied with time . Pesticides were detected in food samples with greatest frequency in spring and summer months and with lowest frequency in winter months . These results support the hypothesis that 4-day average exposure to chlorpyrifos and malathion varies over time for this population mean and for individual members of the population and that correlation between exposures to these two organophosphate pesticides can occur . The measurements of pesticide levels in duplicate plate samples presented here can be used to evaluate and set parameters for dietary exposure models .	24 2 243
23792252	Personal care products ( PCPs ) , such as soaps , perfumes , cosmetics , lotions , etc. , contain a variety of chemicals that have been described as potentially hormone disrupting chemicals . Therefore , it is important to assess the internal exposure of these chemicals in humans . Within the 2nd Flemish Environment and Health Study ( FLEHS II , 2007-2011 ) , the human exposure to three classes of pollutants that are present in a wide variety of PCPs--i.e. polycyclic musks ( galaxolide , HHCB and tonalide , AHTN in blood ) , parabens ( urinary para-hydroxybenzoic acid , HBA ) and triclosan ( urinary TCS)--was assessed in 210 Flemish adolescents ( 14-15 years ) and in 204 adults ( 20-40 years ) randomly selected from the general population according to a stratified two stage clustered study design . The aim of this study was to define average levels of exposure in the general Flemish population and to identify determinants of exposure . Average levels ( GM ( 95% CI) ) in the Flemish adolescents were 0.717 ( 0.682-0.753 ) Î¼g/L for blood HHCB ; 0.118 ( 0.108-0.128 ) Î¼g/L for blood AHTN ; 1022 ( 723-1436 ) Î¼g/L for urinary HBA and 2.19 ( 1.64-2.92 ) Î¼g/L for urinary TCS . In the adults , levels of HBA were on average 634 ( 471-970 ) Î¼g/L . Inter-individual variability was small for HHCB and AHTN , intermediate for HBA , and large for TCS . All biomarkers were positively associated with the use of PCPs . Additionally , levels of HHCB and AHTN increased with higher educational level of the adolescents . Both in adults and adolescents , urinary HBA levels were negatively correlated with BMI . We define here Flemish exposure values for biomarkers of PCPs , which can serve as baseline exposure levels to identify exposure trends in future biomonitoring campaigns .	24 12 22 1 244 122 2 127
17850849	The Alvarado Lagoon System ( ALS ) is located within the Papaloapan River Basin in southern Veracruz , Mexico . The ALS is a shallow system ( 2 m ) connected to the Gulf of Mexico through a narrow sea channel . There are a large number of riverbank communities within the ALS that are dependent upon its biological productivity for comestible and economic subsistence . The purpose of this project was to determine the levels of mercury in water , sediment , fish , and hair samples from within the Papaloapan River Basin and to characterize the risk of Hg exposure to the individuals that reside in these communities . Water and fish samples were collected during the wet ( September 2005 ) and dry ( March 2003 and 2005 ) seasons . Hair samples , dietary surveys , and sediment samples were obtained during the wet and dry seasons of 2005 . Total Hg in the water column ranged from 1.0 to 12.7 ng/L . A strong correlation ( R(2)=0.82 ; p&lt;0.001 ) between total Hg and total suspended solids in the water column suggests that particulate matter is a transport mechanism for Hg within the lagoon system . Total Hg in the sediments ranged from 27.5 to 90.5 ng Hg/g dry weight with no significant difference between the 2005 wet and dry seasons . There was a mild , but significant , correlation between total Hg and % carbon for the March 2005 sediment samples ( R(2)=0.435 ; p=0.020 ) , suggesting that Hg is associated with organic matter on the solid phase . Concentrations of total Hg in fish and shellfish harvested from the ALS ranged from 0.01 to 0.35 microg Hg/g wet . The levels of total Hg in hair ranged from 0.10 to 3.36 microg Hg/g ( n=47 ) and 58% of the samples were above 1.00 microg Hg/g . The findings from this study suggest that individuals who frequently consume fish and shell fish containing low levels of Hg ( &lt;0.3 microg/g ) can accumulate low to moderate body burdens of Hg , as indicated by hair Hg concentrations&gt;1.0 microg/g , and may be at risk for experiencing low dose mercury toxicity .	24 12 1 123 243 2
11266329	Pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) , hexachlorocyclohexane-[alpha] , -beta , and -[gamma] ( HCH-[alpha] , -beta , and -[gamma] ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) are widely distributed industrial chemicals . They are suspected to induce immunologic impairments in exposed individuals . We examined dose-response relationships of blood levels of these chemicals with cellular ( numbers of lymphocyte subpopulations , in vitro lymphocyte response ) or humoral ( plasma cytokine levels , immunoglobulin autoantibodies ) immunologic dysfunctions . We studied 146 patients who had been occupationally exposed primarily to PCBs for more than 6 months . Lymphocyte subpopulations , in vitro responses to mitogens and allogeneic stimulator cells , plasma neopterin , cytokines , soluble cytokine receptors , soluble adhesion molecules , anti-Ig autoantibodies , and liver transaminases were determined . Blood levels of the different compounds were strongly correlated with one another . There were only weak dose-response relationships between blood levels of PCBs with cellular immune parameters , and of HCHs and HCB with humoral immune parameters . An exception was the statistically significant negative association of HCB with interferon-[gamma] ( IFN-[gamma] ) , indicating that HCB has a significant impact on Th1 lymphocytes . Patients with HCB blood levels above the mean of 1,109 ng/L more often had undetectable IFN-[gamma] blood levels than patients below the mean . Patients with increased PCB 138 ( &gt ; 710 ng/L ) had more frequently undetectable interleukin-4 blood levels than patients with PCB 138 below the mean , and patients with increased PCB 101 ( &gt ; 31 ng/L ) more often had low DR+ cell counts in the blood ( &lt ; 190/microL ) than patients with PCB 101 below the mean . To assess possible cumulative effects , we compared patients who had blood levels of all compounds below background with patients who had blood levels of all compounds above background . Patients with low or absent blood levels of the compounds studied had higher IFN-[gamma] plasma levels , providing some evidence for a cumulative effect of several weakly active compounds . In conclusion , exposure to PCBs , HCB , or HCHs is associated with weak immunologic abnormalities . These results contrast with those obtained in earlier studies of blood levels of PCP , which showed a strong dose-dependent relationship with immunologic impairments . Our data suggest that long-term exposure of patients to HCB suppresses IFN-[gamma] production .	11 12 122 1 11122 11123 111 1112 1113
23787105	INTRODUCTION Information on the relationship between levels of particulate matter ( PM ) smaller than 2.5 Î¼m and mortality rates in Europe is relatively sparse because of limited availability of PM2.5 measurement data . Even less information is available on the health effects attributable to PM2.5-10 , especially for North-West Europe . OBJECTIVES To investigate the relationship between various PM size fractions and daily mortality rates . METHODS Daily concentrations of PM from the Dutch National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Network as well as all cause and cause-specific mortality rates in The Netherlands were obtained for the period 2008-2009 . Poisson regression analysis using generalized additive models was used , with adjustment for potential confounding including long-term and seasonal trends , influenza incidence , meteorological variables , day of the week , and holidays . Different measures of PM ( PM2.5 , PM10 and PM2.5-10 ) were analysed . RESULTS PM10 and PM2.5 levels were statistically significantly ( p&lt;0.05 ) associated with all cause and cause-specific deaths . For example , a 10 Î¼g/m(3) increase in previous day PM was associated with 0.8% ( 95% CI 0.3-1.2 ) excess risk in all cause mortality for PM2.5 and a 0.6% ( CI 0.2-1.0 ) excess risk for PM10 . No appreciable associations were observed for PM2.5-10 . Effects of PM10 , and PM2.5 were insensitive to adjustment for PM2.5-10 , and vice-versa . PM10 and PM2.5 were too highly correlated to disentangle their independent effects . CONCLUSIONS PM10 and PM2.5 both were significantly associated with all cause and cause-specific mortality . We were unable to demonstrate significant effects for PM2.5-10 , possibly due to the lower temporal variability and the higher exposure misclassification in PM2.5-10 compared to PM10 or PM2.5 . The lack of effects of PM2.5-10 in our study should therefore not be interpreted as an indication that PM2.5-10 can be considered harmless .	2 231 23
23044994	OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of prenatal mercury exposure and fish intake with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD)-related behavior . METHODS For a population-based prospective birth cohort recruited in New Bedford , Massachusetts ( 1993-1998 ) , we analyzed data for children examined at age 8 years with peripartum maternal hair mercury measures ( n = 421 ) or maternal report of fish consumption during pregnancy ( n = 515 ) . Inattentive and impulsive/hyperactive behaviors were assessed using a teacher rating scale and neuropsychological testing . RESULTS The median maternal hair mercury level was 0.45 Î¼g/g ( range , 0.03-5.14 Î¼g/g ) , and 52% of mothers consumed more than 2 fish servings weekly . In multivariable regression models , mercury exposure was associated with inattention and impulsivity/hyperactivity ; some outcomes had an apparent threshold with associations at 1 Î¼g/g or greater of mercury . For example , at 1 Î¼g/g or greater , the adjusted risk ratios for mild/markedly atypical inattentive and impulsive/hyperactive behaviors were 1.4 ( 95% CI , 1.0-1.8 ) and 1.7 ( 95% CI , 1.2-2.4 ) , respectively , for an interquartile range ( 0.5 Î¼g/g ) mercury increase ; there was no confounding by fish consumption . For neuropsychological assessments , mercury and behavior associations were detected primarily for boys . There was a protective association for fish consumption ( &gt;2 servings per week ) with ADHD-related behaviors , particularly impulsive/hyperactive behaviors ( relative risk = 0.4 ; 95% CI , 0.2-0.6 ) . CONCLUSIONS Low-level prenatal mercury exposure is associated with a greater risk of ADHD-related behaviors , and fish consumption during pregnancy is protective of these behaviors . These findings underscore the difficulties of balancing the benefits of fish intake with the detriments of low-level mercury exposure in developing dietary recommendations in pregnancy .	24 11 12 1 123 243 112 2
11286209	The objective of this paper is to devise a way to facilitate the use of fixed air monitors data in order to assess population exposure . A weighting scheme that uses the data from different monitoring sites and takes into account the time-activity patterns of the study population is proposed . PM2.5 personal monitoring data were obtained within the European EXPOLIS study , in Grenoble , France ( 40 adult non-smoking volunteers , winter 1997 ) . Volunteers carried PM2.5 personal monitors during 48 h and filled in time-activity diaries . Workplaces and places of residence were classified into two categories using a Geographic Information System ( GIS ) : some volunteers ' life environments are seen as best represented by PM10 ambient air monitors located in urban background sites ; others by monitors situated close to high traffic density sites ( proximity sites ) . Measurements from the Grenoble fixed monitoring network using a TEOM PM10 sampler were available across the same period for these two types of sites ( PM10block and PM10prox ) . These data were used to compute a translator parameter deltai that forces the measured PM2.5 personal exposures ( PM2.5persoi ) to equate the average PM10 urban ambient air concentrations ( [ PM10back + PM10prox]/2 ) measured the same days . Average deltai was 4.2 microg/m3 ( CI95%[-3.4 ; 11.9] ) , with true average PM2.5 personal exposure being 36.2 microg/m3 ( 28.2 ; 44.1 ) . PM10 ambient levels at the proximity site and at the background site were respectively PM10prox = 43.8 microg/m3 ( 37.1 ; 50.6 ) and PM10back = 37.0 microg/m3 ( 31.8 ; 42.3 ) . In order to assess the consistency of this approach , six scenarios of ' proximity ' and ' background ' environments were accommodated , according to traffic intensity and road distance . Deltai was estimated for the entire EXPOLIS population and for subgroups , using terciles based on the percentage of time spent in proximity by each subject . Other similar studies need to be conducted in different urban settings , and with other pollutants , in order to assess the generalizability of this simple approach to estimate population exposures from air quality surveillance data .	2 233 231 23
23077794	INTRODUCTION Conflicting opinions exist about the reliability of biomarkers of low-level exposure to benzene . We compared the ability of the urinary excretion of trans,trans-muconic acid ( t,t-MA ) , s-phenilmercapturic acid ( s-PAMA ) and urinary benzene ( U-Benz ) to detect low level occupational and environmental exposure to benzene . METHODS We monitored airborne benzene by personal air sampling , and U-Benz , s-PMAI , t,t-MA and cotinine ( U-Cotinine ) in spot urine samples , collected at 8 am and 8 pm , in 32 oil refinery workers and 65 subjects , randomly selected among the general population of urban and suburban Cagliari , Italy . Information on personal characteristics , diet and events during the sampling day was acquired through in person interviews . RESULTS The median concentration of airborne benzene was 25.2 microg/m3 in oil refinery workers , and 8.5 microg/m3 in the general population subgroup . U-Benz in morning and evening samples was significantly more elevated among oil refinery workers than the general population subgroup ( p = 0.012 , and p = 7.4 x 10(-7) , respectively ) and among current smokers compared to non-smokers ( p = 5.2 x 10(-8) , and p = 5.2 x 10(-5) respectively ) . Benzene biomarkers and their readings in the two sampling phases were well correlated to each other . The Spearman's correlation coefficient with airborne benzene was significant for U-Benz in the evening sample , while no correlation was seen with t,t-MA and s-PMA readings in either samplings . The two benzene metabolites were frequently below limit of detection ( LOD ) , particularly among the general population study subjects ( 17-9% and 39% , for t,t-MA and s-PMA respectively ) . Morning U-Cotinine excretion showed a good correlation with U-Benz in the morning and in the evening sampling ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) , and with s-PMA in the evening sample ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) , but not with t,t-MA in either samplings. t,t-MA in the evening sample was the only biomarker showing a moderate inverse correlation with BMI ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) . The multiple regression analysis adjusting by BMI and number of cigarettes smoked during the day confirmed the results of the univariate analysis . DISCUSSION Our results suggest that unmetabolized U-Benz would allow a more reliable biomonitoring of low-level exposure to benzene than s-PMA and t,t-MA .	24 12 23 1 2 243 127 233
17687453	CONTEXT Private wells that tap groundwater are largely exempt from federal drinking-water regulations , and in most states well water is not subject to much of the mandatory testing required of public water systems . Families that rely on private wells are thus at risk of exposure to a variety of unmeasured contaminants . CASE PRESENTATION A family of seven--two adults and five children--residing in rural northwestern Connecticut discovered elevated concentrations of uranium in their drinking water , with levels measured at 866 and 1,160 microg/L , values well above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant level for uranium in public water supplies of 30 microg/L . The uranium was of natural origin , and the source of exposure was found to be a 500-foot well that tapped groundwater from the Brookfield Gneiss , a geologic formation known to contain uranium . Other nearby wells also had elevated uranium , arsenic , and radon levels , though concentrations varied widely . At least one 24-hr urine uranium level was elevated ( &gt ; 1 microg/24 hr ) in six of seven family members ( range , 1.1-2.5 microg/24 hr ) . To assess possible renal injury , we measured urinary beta-2-microglobulin . Levels were elevated ( &gt ; 120 microg/L ) in five of seven family members , but after correction for creatine excretion , the beta-2-microglobulin excretion rate remained elevated ( &gt ; 40 microg/mmol creatinine ) only in the youngest child , a 3-year-old with a corrected level of 90 microg/mmol creatinine . Three months after cessation of well water consumption , this child's corrected beta-2-microglobulin level had fallen to 52 microg/mmol creatinine . SIGNIFICANCE This case underscores the hazards of consuming groundwater from private wells . It documents the potential for significant residential exposure to naturally occurring uranium in well water . It highlights the special sensitivity of young children to residential environmental exposures , a reflection of the large amount of time they spend in their homes , the developmental immaturity of their kidneys and other organ systems , and the large volume of water they consume relative to body mass .	24 11 12 1 2 241 11123 127 111 1112
11286218	As part of the assessment of a site in northern France polluted by metals from two smelters ( in particular , lead , cadmium and mercury ) , a cross-sectional study was carried out which intended to estimate the levels of the lead burden of the adult population living on the site and the factors associated with these levels . The exposed zone included 10 municipalities in the Nord-Pas de Calais region , located in the vicinity of two non-ferrous metal smelters . The soils in these municipalities contained between 100 and 1700 ppm of lead . The non-polluted zone contained 20 municipalities from the same region , drawn randomly from those in the region of comparable size but free from any industrial lead exposure . The adult study population ( 301 men and 300 women ) was stratified according to age , sex , employment status and exposure level . The inclusion criteria required subjects who were aged between 20 and 50 years and had been living in the exposed zone for at least 8 years ; the exclusion criteria were pregnancy , cancer , kidney disease and diabetes . No more than 10% of the subjects participating could work at one of the two smelters . Data collection took place at home ; visiting nurses interviewed subjects to complete a questionnaire and also took blood samples . The lead assay was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry . The geometric mean of the blood-lead levels was 74 microg/l , 95% CI = 69-80 among men and 49 microg/l , 95% CI = 46-53 among women . Blood-lead levels exceeding 100 microg/l were found among 30% of men and 12% of women . Several factors were associated with variation of the mean blood-lead level : the blood-lead level was significantly higher among the men for subjects living less than 1 km from the smelters ( geometric mean x 1.3 , 95% CI = 1.1-1.6 ) , for those who drink alcoholic beverages ( x 1.1 , 95% CI = 1.0-1.2 for consumption of 30 g/day ) , those who smoke ( x 1.2 , 95% CI = 1.0-1.3 for 20 cigarettes/day ) , and for subjects with occupational exposure ; among the women , for subjects living less than 1 km from the smelters ( geometric mean x 1.5 , 95% CI = 1.2-1.7 ) , for those who drink alcohol ( x 1.1 , 95% CI = 1.1-1.2 for a daily consumption of 10 g ) , and for women living in a building constructed before 1948 ( x 1.2 , 95% CI = 1.0-1.4 ) .	1 122 12
11305339	In a previous study , we speculated that some of the high mercury levels observed in head hair from a total of 14 subjects who resided around Lake Victoria , Tanzania , might be attributable to the habitual use of toilet soap containing considerable amounts of mercury ( Harada et al . Sci Total Environ 1999;227:249-256 ) . In August 1998 , the current study was conducted to investigate if such mercury-containing soap was also available in the surroundings of Lake Victoria , Kenya , and if so , its toxic effects . A total of nine goldminers , 44 fishermen and their families , and 12 residents of Kisumu City , Kenya , volunteered for the study . Fourteen types of toilet soap were collected in Kisumu . Total mercury content was very significantly higher than in European-made soap ( 0.47-1.7% , as mercury iodide ) compared with Kenya-made soap ( 0.41 x 10(-4)-6.2 x 10(-4)% ) . Indeed , all the subjects with a high hair mercury level ( &gt ; 36.1 ppm ) had made habitual use of European-made soap , accompanied by various symptoms , such as tremor , lassitude , vertigo , neurosthenia , and black and white blots , suggesting inorganic-mercury poisoning . On the other hand , any subject who had used soap other than the European-made soap , did not exceed a mercury level of 10 ppm in hair that is well within normal limits ( Harada et al . Sci Total Environ 1999:227:249-256 ) . The findings obtained suggest that the mercury-containing soap must be barred from circulation without delay , and that the residents ' health in addition to the environmental pollution in Lake Victoria ( Kenya as well as Tanzania ) should be kept under close observation .	11 24 12 22 1 244 123 112 2
11305341	Workers who work near volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) source(s) , motor vehicle exhausts and/or gasoline vapor emissions , are suspected to be exposed to highly-elevated VOC levels during their work-time . This study confirmed this suspicion and evaluated the work-time exposure VOCs for traffic police officers , parking garage attendants , service station attendants , roadside storekeepers and underground storekeepers , by measuring the concentrations of six aromatic VOCs in workplace air , or personal air and breath samples . For nearly all target VOCs , the post-work breath concentrations of the workers were slightly or significantly higher than the pre-work breath concentrations , depending on the compound and occupation . Furthermore , both the pre- and post-work breath concentrations of the workers showed elevated levels compared with a control group of college students . The post-work breath concentrations were significantly correlated with the personal air concentrations , while the pre-work breath concentrations were not . Smoking workers were not always exposed to higher aromatic VOC levels than non-smoking workers . The breath and personal air concentrations for all the target compounds were both higher for underground parking garage attendants than for ground-level parking attendants . For all the target compounds except toluene , storekeepers exhibited similar levels of exposure for all store types . Print shopkeepers recorded the highest toluene exposure .	12 23 1 2 125 232 233
17612154	Synthetic musk compounds are used as additives in many consumer products , including perfumes , deodorants , and detergents . Earlier studies have reported the occurrence of synthetic musks in environmental and wildlife samples collected in the United States . In this study , human breast milk samples collected from Massachusetts , were analyzed for the determination of concentrations of synthetic musks such as musk xylene ( 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene ) , musk ketone ( 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-dinitroacetophenone ) , HHCB ( 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[gamma]-2-benzopyran ) , AHTN ( 7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene ) , and HHCB-lactone , the oxidation product of HHCB . In addition , we estimated the daily intake of synthetic musks by infants based on the ingestion rate of breast milk . Synthetic musks were found in most of the samples analyzed , and the concentrations ranged from &lt ; 2 to 150 ng musk xylene/g , &lt ; 2 to 238 ng musk ketone/ g , &lt ; 5 to 917 ng HHCB/g , &lt ; 5 to 144 ng AHTN/g , and &lt ; 10 to 88.0 ng HHCB-lactone/g , on a lipid weight basis . The concentrations of HHCB were higher than the concentrations of other synthetic musks in breast milk samples . The mean concentration of HHCB ( 220 ng/g , lipid weight ) was 5 times greater than the concentrations reported 10 years ago for breast milk samples collected in Germany and Denmark . Maternal age was not correlated with the concentrations of musk xylene , musk ketone , HHCB , or AHTN . There was a trend of decreasing concentrations of musk xylene , musk ketone , HHCB , and AHTN , with the number of children previously breast-fed , although the correlation was not significant . Based on average daily ingestion rate of breast milk , an infant is estimated to ingest 297 +/- 229 ng musk xylene , 780 +/- 805 ng musk ketone , 1830 +/- 1170 ng HHCB , 565 +/- 614 ng AHTN , and 649 +/- 598 ng HHCB-lactone per day . The ingestion rate of synthetic musks by infants in the United States is lower than that estimated for persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) . Based on the residue patterns and accumulation features , it can be concluded that the exposure characteristics for synthetic musks are different from those of POPs , and that the major source of exposure to synthetic musks is probably via dermal absorption or inhalation .	24 12 1 2 124 243
11323784	BACKGROUND Results from a 1990-1992 longitudinal study of several reinforced plastics plants showed that for those workers whose styrene exposure had decreased , color vision ( CV ) improved ; while near visual contrast sensitivity ( CS ) was poorer . METHODS In 1999 , we retested these visual functions in 18 workers with good visual acuity . A cumulative exposure index ( CEI ) , corrected for respirator use , was calculated for each worker . RESULTS Intra-individual comparison of mandelic acid ( MA ) showed a significant decrease over time ( Friedman ; P = 0.015 ) , but current values were not related to CEI . For CV , no significant difference was observed between 1992 and 1999 ; present results were not related to MA or CEI . The CS profile decreased over time , with significant differences at 3 cpd ( Friedman ; P &lt ; 0.05 ) . CS did not vary with MA levels , but was significantly depressed at the intermediate frequencies among those in the upper CEIH category ( Kruskal-Wallis ; P &lt ; 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that CS loss increases with long-term cumulative exposure , reflecting chronic damage to the neuro-optic pathways .	11 1 2 21 112
23715108	OBJECTIVE To reconstruct agent-specific occupational exposures for a cohort of jet engine manufacturing workers for use in an epidemiological mortality study . METHODS Potential chemical and physical exposures at eight jet engine manufacturing and overhaul/repair plants were evaluated for the period 1952 to 2001 . Eleven agents were selected for detailed examination , and a job-exposure matrix was constructed . RESULTS Quantitative exposure estimates were generated for metalworking fluids , nickel , cobalt , chromium , solvents , and incomplete combustion aerosol from metalworking fluids . Qualitative exposure estimates were assigned for ionizing radiation , electromagnetic fields , polychlorinated biphenyls , and lead-cadmium . All exposures showed decreasing trends over the study period . CONCLUSIONS The quantitative exposure levels generated in this study were lower than early contemporaneous professional practice recommendations and were similar to or lower than published data from other industries .	2 21
17589597	BACKGROUND Dermal and inhalation exposure to jet propulsion fuel 8 ( JP-8 ) have been measured in a few occupational exposure studies . However , a quantitative understanding of the relationship between external exposures and end-exhaled air concentrations has not been described for occupational and environmental exposure scenarios . OBJECTIVE Our goal was to construct a physiologically based toxicokinetic ( PBTK ) model that quantitatively describes the relative contribution of dermal and inhalation exposures to the end-exhaled air concentrations of naphthalene among U.S. Air Force personnel . METHODS The PBTK model comprised five compartments representing the stratum corneum , viable epidermis , blood , fat , and other tissues . The parameters were optimized using exclusively human exposure and biological monitoring data . RESULTS The optimized values of parameters for naphthalene were a ) permeability coefficient for the stratum corneum 6.8 x 10(-5) cm/hr , b ) permeability coefficient for the viable epidermis 3.0 x 10(-3) cm/hr , c ) fat:blood partition coefficient 25.6 , and d ) other tissue:blood partition coefficient 5.2 . The skin permeability coefficient was comparable to the values estimated from in vitro studies . Based on simulations of workers ' exposures to JP-8 during aircraft fuel-cell maintenance operations , the median relative contribution of dermal exposure to the end-exhaled breath concentration of naphthalene was 4% ( 10th percentile 1% and 90th percentile 11% ) . CONCLUSIONS PBTK modeling allowed contributions of the end-exhaled air concentration of naphthalene to be partitioned between dermal and inhalation routes of exposure . Further study of inter- and intraindividual variations in exposure assessment is required to better characterize the toxicokinetic behavior of JP-8 components after occupational and/or environmental exposures .	2 21 22 23
11327389	Our previous research ( Soleo L , Vacca A , Vimercati L et al . Occup Environ Med 1997;54:437-442 ) showed a reduction in tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) serum levels in workers with prolonged exposure to low doses of inorganic mercury , suggesting an in vivo functional defect of the monocyte-macrophage system . On this basis , here we wondered whether workers exposed to lower doses of metallic mercury displayed possible changes in the monocyte-macrophage system . In this particular cohort of workers , we also sought for the effects of the exposure on the polymorphonuclear leukocytes ( PMNL ) chemotaxis . The monocyte-macrophage system and the natural killer ( NK ) cells were examined in 19 exposed workers and in 25 unexposed workers , as the control group ( controls ) . Specifically , the circulating monocyte-macrophage cells and their CD13 , CD15 and CD33 subsets , serum cytokines ( IL-8 , GM-CSF and TNF-alpha ) and the NK cells were analyzed . In seven exposed and seven controls randomly chosen workers the PMNL chemotaxis was also assessed . The selected indicator of mercury exposure were the levels of mercury in the urine ( U-Hg ) , that was significantly higher in exposed workers than the controls ( 9.7 +/- 5.5 microg/l and 2.4 +/- 1.2 microg/l , respectively ) . None of the exposed workers had shown signs of either acute or chronic inorganic mercury toxicity or any form of hypersensitivity . Several immunological variables tested , monocyte-macrophage cells and their subsets , NK cells and serum cytokines overlapped between the exposed and the control workers . When the workers were considered as a whole ( exposed plus controls ) , no correlation was found between current U-Hg and all immunological parameters . However , when exposed workers were studied separately , an inverse correlation was disclosed between cumulative U-Hg and cells ( as percentage ) expressing the CD13 ( r = -0.599 ; P = 0.007 ) and CD15 ( r = -0.614 ; P = 0.005 ) molecules , and NK cells ( r = -0.455 ; P = 0.05 ) . Moreover , a significant impairment in the PMNL chemotaxis ( t = 3.70 ; P = 0.003 ) was observed in the exposed workers . The results of our study suggest that the exposure to very low levels of metallic mercury led to subtle impairment of circulating monocyte and NK cells ( as percentages ) according to the increase in U-Hg levels , as well as of the PMNL chemotactic function in this particular group of workers , even though they remain clinically asymptomatic . Therefore , we suggest that impairment of these parameters provide a sensitive indicator of metallic mercury and other chemical contaminants present in the environment .	11 12 1 1113 11123 111 127 1112
23680090	Mercury exposure is of particular concern since mercury is a neurotoxin and the developing fetus is most sensitive to its adverse effect . Human blood is routinely used as an indicator for the evaluation of human exposure to Hg . To investigate Hg species in human plasma for Hong Kong residents and the relationship between fish consumption and Hg species in plasma , 151 plasma samples were analyzed for Hg species . The mean values of total Hg ( THg ) and methyl-mercury ( MeHg ) concentration in plasma were 0.62 and 0.28 Î¼g/L , respectively . No significant differences were observed between females and males as well as among age groups . Fish consumption rate was significantly positively correlated with MeHg concentrations in plasma , which demonstrated that plasma could be a biomarker for human MeHg exposure . Two methods were used to estimate human MeHg exposure . One was based on fish MeHg content and fish consumption rate ( EDI(Fish) ) , another was employed by converting MeHg concentration in blood to MeHg exposure amount ( EDI(Blood) ) . A significant positive correlation was observed between EDI(Blood) and EDI(Fish) , and no significant difference was found between EDI(Blood) and EDI(Fish) . These results demonstrated that fish consumption was the major source of MeHg for humans .	24 12 21 1 122 2 243
23639909	During pregnancy , the fetus is exposed to contaminants from its mother's diet . This work provides an assessment of the dietary exposure of pregnant women to inorganic contaminants ( aluminum , mercury , lead , inorganic arsenic , cobalt ) , polychlorodibenzodioxins , polychlorodibenzofurans , dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls ( DL-PCBs , NDL-PCBs ) , polybromodiphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , perfluoroalkyl acids , mycotoxins ( zearalenone , patulin , trichothecenes ) , and heat-generated compounds ( acrylamide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) . Consumption data of 2002 pregnant women aged 18 to 45 from the EDEN cohort study were combined with contamination data from the second French total diet study to assess the exposure before pregnancy ( n=1861 ) and during the third trimester of pregnancy ( n=1775 ) . Exposure was also assessed considering the season during which the third trimester of pregnancy occurred . Significant changes in consumptions during pregnancy and between seasons were associated with differences in exposures for some substances . Some contaminant exposures appeared to be of health concern . Margins of exposure to acrylamide ( 635 to 1094 for mean ) , inorganic arsenic , lead , and BDE-99 ( â¤100 ) were too low to exclude all risks . For NDL-PCBs , T-2 and HT-2 toxins , and deoxynivalenol , significant exceedings of toxicological reference values were found before pregnancy , but there was no significant exceeding in the third trimester .	24 2 243
23639907	Hexabromocyclododecane diastereoisomers ( Î± , Î² , and Î³-HBCD ) and tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA ) were investigated in air conditioning filter dust ( designated as particulate phase of indoor air , PPIA ) collected from an office building in Shenzhen , China in 2009 . Concentrations of Î£HBCD ( sum of Î±- , Î²- , and Î³-HBCD ) ranged from 652 to 122 , 973 ng/g in PPIA . Generally , Î³-HBCD was the most abundant diastereomer . Concentrations of TBBPA ranged from 30 to 59 , 140 ng/g in PPIA . According to our results , approximate 61.9 pg/kg body weight/day ( pg/kg/d ) PM2.5 bound Î£HBCD can be inhaled deep into the lungs and 31.3 pg/kg/d PM10 bound Î£HBCD tends to be deposited in the upper parts of the respiratory system , and those values of TBBPA were 28.7 pg/kg/d and 14.5 pg/kg/d for the lower and upper respiratory tracts , respectively . The average intakes of Î£HBCD via dust inhalation and ingestion were 37.92 pg/kg/d and 2 , 079 pg/kg/d for adults , and those data of TBBPA were 17.62 pg/kg/d and 966.2 pg/kg/d , respectively . Our research found that exposure via indoor dust inhalation and ingestion contributed more than dietary pathway . Sensitivity analysis result suggests that the concentration of HBCD and TBBPA is the most significant parameter governing estimated results , and the other parameters , such as body weight and inhalation rate , do not affect the outcome much .	24 2 232 242 23
22359069	The objectives of this study are to investigate the volatile organic compound ( VOC ) distribution using passive samplers and to assess the resulting health risks in a high-tech science industrial park . With the advantages of passive sampling techniques , long-term and wide-area samples are collected . The results show TVOC concentrations in summer , fall , winter , and spring are 7.14 Â± 5.66 ppb , 18.17 Â± 5.81 ppb , 10.30 Â± 3.54 ppb , and 14.56 Â± 4.53 ppb , respectively ; those on weekdays and weekends are 14.36 Â± 6.80 ppb and 9.87 Â± 4.86 ppb , respectively ; and those in industrial and residential zones are 12.97 Â± 0.39 ppb and 11.13 Â± 0.68 ppb , respectively . Based on concentration variations , and benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , and xylene ratios , we can resolve the source origins . Health risks are assessed based on the resulting concentrations . In the case of non-cancer chronic effects , long-term exposure to these concentrations does not support there is a risk of adverse health effects . However , potential cancer risks of exposure to these concentrations may occur , especially to carbon tetrachloride and benzene . By applying this study's procedures , information on VOC concentration distribution , source identification , and health assessment can be obtained and they are applicable to similar studies .	2 232 23
17490710	Although the use of organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) has been prohibited in Singapore since 1980 , OCPs and PCBs still can be detected in the environment and represent a potential threat to public health . In this study , OCPs and PCBs were measured in house dust samples collected from 31 homes across the island-state of Singapore . Organochlorine pesticides , such as hexachlorocyclohexanes ( HCHs ) , chlordanes and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes ( DDTs ) were tested , with a range of &lt;LOD to 240ngg(-1) dust , &lt;LOD to 110ngg(-1) dust and &lt;LOD to 770ngg(-1) dust , respectively . Of 41 target PCB congeners measured , 28 were detected , and the median level of SigmaPCBs was 5.6ngg(-1) dust . The prevalence of these pesticides and industrial chemicals which have been banned many years ago suggests limited indoor degradation and on-going environmental accumulation . Weak negative correlations between an increased elevation of the residence and the concentration of DDTs and some low-chlorinated PCB congeners were noted , most likely due to increased ventilation and distance from ground-based sources at higher floors . Levels detected in several studies conducted in the USA were several orders of magnitude higher than concentrations observed in Singapore . Heavier use of chlorinated products in the USA , as well as different sampling methods , sampling time and site characteristics are likely explanations for the observed differences . Daily human intake of OCPs and PCBs via house dust was calculated , but values were low compared with dietary data from overseas . Ingestion of dust is indeed an exposure passway for these organochlorines , but may not be the predominant one .	24 2 242
23639905	China is one of the countries with the highest ambient particle levels in the world ; however , there have been no epidemiologic studies examining the effects of fine particle ( PM2.5 ) , coarse particle ( PM10-2.5 ) and black carbon ( BC ) simultaneously on morbidity outcomes . In this study , we conducted a time-series analysis to evaluate the acute effects of PM2.5 , PM10-2.5 , and BC on daily hospital visits in Shanghai , China . During our study period , the mean daily concentrations of PM2.5 , PM10-2.5 and BC were 53.9 Î¼g/m(3) , 38.4 Î¼g/m(3) and 3.9 Î¼g/m(3) , respectively . We found significant associations of PM2.5 , PM 10-2.5 , and BC with daily hospital visits . An inter-quartile range increase of the average concentrations of the current and previous days in PM2.5 , PM10-2.5 and BC was associated with a 1.88% ( 95% CI : 0.69% to 3.06% ) , a 1.30% ( 95% CI : 0.25% to 2.34% ) and a 1.33% ( 95% CI : 0.34% to 2.32% ) increase in emergency-room visits , respectively . For outpatient visits , the corresponding estimated changes were -2.44% ( 95% CI : -6.62% to 1.74% ) , 1.09% ( 95% CI : -2.72% to 4.90% ) and 3.34% ( 95% CI : 0.10% to 6.57% ) respectively . The effects of BC were more robust than the effects of PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 in two-pollutant models . To our knowledge , this is the first study in China , or even in Asian developing countries , to report the effect of PM2.5 , PM10-2.5 , and BC simultaneously on morbidity . Our findings also suggest that BC could serve as a valuable air quality indicator that reflects the health risks of airborne particles .	2 231 23
23621775	Data on early human fetal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) is limited . However , early pregnancy , in particular the first trimester , is critical for fetal development . We investigated exposure to PBDEs and placental transfer during early pregnancy by analyzing PBDEs in paired aborted fetuses ( n = 65 ) , placentas ( n = 65 ) , and maternal blood samples ( n = 31 ) at 10-13 weeks gestation , which were collected in a hospital near electronic wastes ( e-wastes ) recycling sites in Taizhou , China . Mean total PBDE ( âPBDE ) concentrations were 4.46 , 7.90 , and 15.7 ng/g of lipid weight ( lw ) in the fetuses , placentas , and blood , respectively . The three matrices had roughly similar PBDE congener profiles , dominated by BDE-209 , BDE-197 , BDE-153 , BDE-47 , and BDE-28 . Significant correlations were found between âPBDE concentrations in the paired matrices . Comparing the concentration ratios between the paired samples , we observed significantly higher fetus/blood and fetus/placenta ratios for BDE-28 , BDE-99 , and BDE-47 than for BDE-197 , BDE-209 , and BDE-153 , while opposite results were found in placenta/blood ratios . Our results indicate that PBDEs can enter the fetus during the first trimester and low-brominated congeners cross the placenta more easily than high-brominated congeners , which tend to remain in the placenta . This phenomenon is consistent with findings at the end of pregnancy .	1 122 12 125 126
17481698	More and more people in Bangladesh have recently become aware of the risk of drinking arsenic-contaminated groundwater , and have been trying to obtain drinking water from less arsenic-contaminated sources . In this study , arsenic intakes of 18 families living in one block of a rural village in an arsenic-affected district of Bangladesh were evaluated to investigate their actual arsenic intake via food , including from cooking water , and to estimate the contribution of each food category and of drinking water to the total arsenic intake . Water consumption rates were estimated by the self-reporting method . The mean drinking water intake was estimated as about 3 L/d without gender difference . Arsenic intakes from food were evaluated by the duplicate portion sampling method . The duplicated foods from each family were divided into four categories ( cooked rice , solid food , cereals for breakfast , and liquid food ) , and the arsenic concentrations of each food category and of the drinking water were measured . The mean arsenic intake from water and food by all 18 respondents was 0.15 +/-0.11 mg/d ( range , 0.043 - 0.49 ) , that by male subjects was 0.18 +/- 0.13 mg/d ( n = 12 ) and that by female subjects was 0.096 +/- 0.007 mg/d ( n = 6 ) . The average contributions to the total arsenic intake were , from drinking water , 13% ; liquid food , 4.4% ; cooked rice , 56% ; solid food , 11% ; and cereals , 16% . Arsenic intake via drinking water was not high despite the highly contaminated groundwater in the survey area because many families had changed their drinking water sources to less-contaminated ones . Instead , cooked rice contributed most to the daily arsenic intake . Use of contaminated water for cooking by several families was suspected based on comparisons of arsenic concentrations between drinking water and liquid food , and between rice before and after cooking . Detailed investigation suggested that six households used contaminated water for cooking but not drinking , leading to an increase of arsenic intake via arsenic-contaminated cooking water .	24 2 241 243
11372882	Hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) is an organochlorine compound widespread in the environment , highly lipophilic , that accumulates in biological systems . It has been suggested that it should be classified as a dioxin-like compound . Newborns are exposed to organochlorine compounds across the placenta and through breastfeeding . Although HCB is one of the most common organochlorine compounds , the transplacental transference of HCB from mother to fetus during pregnancy has been scarcely documented . This study reports the levels of HCB , dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane ( DDT ) and its metabolite p,p'DDE , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( beta-HCH ) in 72 maternal blood samples at delivery and in 69 cord blood samples , from which 62 corresponded to mother infant pairs born between May 1997 and September 1999 in a rural area highly exposed to HCB . Results show that all newborns presented detectable levels of HCB , PCBs , and p,p'DDE , and , to a lesser extent , of beta-HCH , the HCB levels being the highest . The geometric mean of HCB was 1.1 ng/ml , ranging from 0.3 to 5.7 ng/ml . Concentrations of HCB levels in cord blood ( log ng/ml ) were positively associated with concentrations in maternal blood ( log ng/ml ) ( coefficient = 0.45 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) . Gestational age was not associated with the transplacental transfer of HCB . Maternal p,p'DDE and beta-HCH levels were also associated with newborn levels , but levels of PCBs were not . We conclude that HCB , similar to other organochlorinated compounds , has a transplacental transfer .	1 122 12
11372885	Two mass-food poisonings called Yusho and Yucheng occurred in Japan and Taiwan in 1968 and 1979 , respectively . Blood samples from five Yusho patients and three Yucheng patients were collected several times from 1982 to 1998 and from 1980 to 1995 , respectively , and analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDF ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) congeners . Fat base concentrations of 2,3,4,7,8-penta-CDF in the Yusho patients , which were responsible for about 70% of the dioxin toxicity , are estimated to be decreased from 60 ppb in 1969 to 800 ppt in 1997 with the median half-life of 2.9 years in the first 15 years after onset and 7.7 years in the next stage of 15 years . Typical Yusho symptoms of acneiform eruption , dermal pigmentation and increased eye discharge were very gradually recovered with lapse of several years . However , enzyme and/or hormone-mediated signs of high serum triglyceride , high serum thyroxin , immunoglobulin disorder and others are persistently maintained for 30 years .	11 12 122 1 11121 11122 1112 111 112
22494935	Human biomonitoring ( HBM ) is a widely accepted tool to aid assessment of chemical uptake in risk assessment . However , our understanding of the biological relevance of the results of HBM can be restricted , due in some part to the limited information on background environmental exposures and biomarker concentrations in the general population . The study described here specifically addresses the question of what constitutes normal background levels in the UK population of a number of biomarkers ( the chemical itself or one of its stable metabolites ) for a variety of environmental chemicals that are frequently encountered because of their widespread use . The environmental chemicals selected for this study were benzene , chlorinated hydrocarbons , dithiocarbamates , cadmium , mercury , naphthalene , diethylhexyl phthalate , synthetic pyrethroids and xylene . Volunteers ( n=436 ) were randomly sought by a postal survey based on the UK Electoral Register . Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire and provide a urine sample . The overall response rate was 7.5% , with volunteers being recruited from all areas of the UK including , England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . Study participants were adults and comprised 45% male and 55% females . We have conducted a simple , postal-based , cost-effective study and generated similar reference values to very large surveys such as NHANES . This demonstrates that large investigations may not be necessary to get a reasonable idea of environmental exposures , especially in initial ' screening-type ' investigations to identify particular exposures of concern or to demonstrate that exposures are reassuring low and that no further survey data needs to be gathered .	1 12 127
23582134	Women in the United States have breast milk concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) that are among the highest in the world , leading to concerns over the potential health implications to breastfeeding infants during critical stages of growth and development . Developing cost-effective and sustainable methods for assessing chemical exposures in infants is a high priority to federal agencies and local communities . PBDE data are available in nationally representative serum samples but not in breast milk . As a method to predict PBDE concentrations in U.S. breast milk , we present the development of congener-specific linear regression partitioning models and their application to U.S. serum data . Models were developed from existing paired milk and serum data and applied to 2003-2004 NHANES serum data for U.S. women . Highest estimated median U.S. breast milk concentrations were for BDE-47 ( 30.6 ng/g lipid ) and BDE-99 ( 6.1 ng/g lipid ) with the median concentration of Î£7PBDEs estimated at 54.2 ng/g lipid . Predictions of breast milk PBDE concentration were consistent with reported concentrations from 11 similarly timed U.S. studies . When applied to NHANES data , these models provide a sustainable method for estimating population-level concentrations of PBDEs in U.S. breast milk and should improve exposure estimates in breastfeeding infants .	2 21
17450237	BACKGROUND Recently , in a cross-sectional study of 201 children in Araihazar , Bangladesh , exposure to arsenic ( As ) in drinking water has been shown to lower the scores on tests that measure children's intellectual function before and after adjustment for sociodemographic features . OBJECTIVES We investigated the effects of As and fluoride exposure on children's intelligence and growth . METHODS We report the results of a study of 720 children between 8 and 12 years of age in rural villages in Shanyin county , Shanxi province , China . The children were exposed to As at concentrations of 142 +/- 106 microg/L ( medium-As group ) and 190 +/- 183 microg/L ( high-As group ) in drinking water compared with the control group that was exposed to low concentrations of As ( 2 +/- 3 microg/L ) and low concentrations of fluoride ( 0.5 +/- 0.2 mg/L ) . A study group of children exposed to high concentrations of fluoride ( 8.3 +/- 1.9 mg/L ) but low concentrations of As ( 3 +/- 3 microg/L ) was also included because of the common occurrence of elevated concentrations of fluoride in groundwater in our study area . A standardized IQ ( intelligence quotient ) test was modified for children in rural China and was based on the classic Raven's test used to determine the effects of these exposures on children's intelligence . A standardized measurement procedure for weight , height , chest circumference , and lung capacity was used to determine the effects of these exposures on children's growth . RESULTS The mean IQ scores decreased from 105 +/- 15 for the control group , to 101 +/- 16 for the medium-As group ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) , and to 95 +/- 17 for the high-As group ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) . The mean IQ score for the high-fluoride group was 101 +/- 16 and significantly different from that of the control group ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) . Children in the control group were taller than those in the high-fluoride group ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) ; weighed more than the those in the high-As group ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) ; and had higher lung capacity than those in the medium-As group ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Children's intelligence and growth can be affected by high concentrations of As or fluoride . The IQ scores of the children in the high-As group were the lowest among the four groups we investigated . It is more significant that high concentrations of As affect children's intelligence . It indicates that arsenic exposure can affect children's intelligence and growth .	24 11 1 2 241 112
23562690	The human-health risk posed by gardening near a legacy mine and smelter in an arsenic-endemic region of Arizona was characterized in this study . Residential soils were used in a greenhouse study to grow common vegetables , and local residents , after training , collected soil , water , and vegetables samples from their home gardens . Concentrations of arsenic measured in water , soil , and vegetable samples were used in conjunction with reported US intake rates to calculate the daily dose , Incremental Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk ( IELCR ) , and Hazard Quotient for arsenic . Relative arsenic intake dose decreased in order : water&gt;garden soils&gt;homegrown vegetables , and on average , each accounted for 77 , 16 , and 7% of a residential gardener's daily arsenic intake dose . The IELCR ranges for vegetables , garden soils , and water were 10(-8) to 10(-4) , 10(-6) to 10(-4) , and 10(-5) to 10(-2) , respectively . All vegetables ( greenhouse and home garden ) were grouped by scientific family , and the risk posed decreased as : Asteraceaeâ«Fabaceae&gt;Amaranthaceae&gt;Liliaceae&gt;Brassicaceae&gt;Solanaceaeâ«Cucurbitaceae . Correlations observed between concentrations of arsenic in vegetables and soils were used to estimate a maximum allowable level of arsenic in soil to limit the excess cancer risk to 10(-6) . The estimated values are 1.56 mg kg(-1) , 5.39 mg kg(-1) , 11.6 mg kg(-1) and 12.4 mg kg(-1) for the Asteraceae , Brassicaceae , Fabaceae , and Amaranthaceae families , respectively . It is recommended that home gardeners : sample their private wells annually , test their soils prior to gardening , and , if necessary , modify their gardening behavior to reduce incidental soil ingestion . This study highlights the importance of site-specific risk assessment , and the need for species-specific planting guidelines for communities .	24 245 2 241 243
11376862	A follow-up survey on 2101 inhabitants ( 1566 men , 535 women ) , who participated in a 1967 health survey and had resided in their present rural community since birth was conducted to determine the influence of environmental cadmium exposure on the mortality of the general population in the Jinzu River basin . The survey was conducted over 6128 days from August 1 , 1967 to May 10 , 1984 . The rural communities were divided into two groups , one with a cadmium concentration in rice of &lt ; 0.30 ppm and the other &gt ; or = 0.30 ppm . The influence of cadmium concentration in rice on mortality was analyzed using SMRs and a Cox's proportional hazards model . In both sexes , SMRs tended to be greater in the &gt ; or = 0.3 ppm group as compared to &lt ; 0.3 ppm group . The Cox hazard ratios for males and females in the &gt ; or = 0.30 ppm group , to those in the &lt ; 0.30 ppm group , were 1.42 and 1.10 , respectively ( significant in the men ) . Since the mean cadmium concentration in rice in each rural community was closely related to the development of renal injury , in regions with high cadmium concentrations in rice , the development of renal injury induced by cadmium is believed to be the factor underlying the increased mortality observed .	24 2 243
23562682	The purpose of the study was to analyse temporal trends ( 1993-2009 ) of the concentrations of organochlorine contaminants ( 14 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) and 11 pesticides ) in the blood of Greenland Inuit according to age and urbanisation . Statistical determinants for the contaminant concentrations included ( for PCB congener 153 ) age ( Îr(2)=0.35 ) , marine diet ( Îr(2)=0.10 ) , smoking ( Îr(2)=0.02 ) , and sex ( Îr(2)=0.01 ) with comparable results for other organochlorine contaminants . After adjustment for age , diet , smoking , and sex a significant decreasing trend was present for all contaminants ranging from 41% for mirex to 56% for hexachlorobenzene . The temporal trend was most pronounced among participants below the age of 65 years . The decrease started later in villages than in towns . The decrease was present in all age groups and in the capital , other towns , and villages . The decrease is probably due to a combination of reduced concentrations of the contaminants in the wildlife and a slight temporal reduction in the consumption of marine mammals . The significant downwards trend of legacy POPs shows that the legislation works but it must be kept in mind that according to the cumulated scientific evidence there are a multitude of non-regulated persistent organic contaminants in the diet as well as high levels of methylmercury .	24 12 1 122 2 243
22704486	Arsenic ( As ) pollution in the surroundings of metal mines has been observed , and may induce serious health problems , in particular cancer . Health hazard attributed to As in contaminated soil and water in the vicinity of closed or abandoned metal mines may be high . Little is known about how environmental exposure to As has affected the health of resident near closed metal mines . The objectives of this study were to compare the urinary level of As for those living near closed metal mines ( the exposed group ) with that of non-exposed group ; and to investigate the correlation between As levels in soil ( SoilAs ) and water ( WaterAs ) and the urinary levels ( UrineAs ) of residents in the exposed group . Data for SoilAs and WaterAs were obtained from the national environmental survey performed between 2003 and 2005 by the Ministry of Environment in Korea . To measure UrineAs , 2674 and 237 subjects were selected from 67 closed metal mines ( exposed areas ) and two rural areas ( non-exposed areas ) , respectively . Five milliliters of urine samples were taken , and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry was used to analyze UrineAs . Of all the exposed areas , high SoilAs and WaterAs areas that exceed the Korean standards of As in soil ( 6 mg/kg-soil ) and stream or groundwater ( 0.05 mg/l-water ) were classified to evaluate the health risks in high polluted areas . Also , high UrineAs group was defined as 20 Î¼g/g creatinine or more . Student's t-test was performed to compare the UrineAs level between the exposed and non-exposed groups . The odds ratio ( OR ) was calculated by a logistic analysis to evaluate the risk for high UrineAs level from high SoilAs and WaterAs areas . The mean of urinary As were 8.90 Â± 8.34 Î¼g/g-creatinine for the exposed group and 7.68 Â± 4.98 Î¼g/g creatinine for the non-exposed group , respectively ; and the significant difference of urinary As level was observed between both groups ( p&lt;0.05 ) . Moreover , the means for urinary As of people in areas with high As level in soil and water were significantly higher than that for the control areas ( p&lt;0.001 ) , and these differences were more pronounced for the As level in water . The odds of subjects with high UrineAs were positively and significantly associated with living in the areas with high As level in soil ( OR=1.62 ; 95% C.I.=1.13-2.31 ) . These associations were much stronger for the areas with high WaterAs ( OR=3.79 ; 95% C.I.=2.32-6.19 ) . These results indicate that the high level of As in environment may increase the risk of having high urinary As level of people in the exposed areas .	24 1 12 245 2 241 127
23538138	BACKGROUND Some clinical studies have suggested that ingestion of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) has neuroprotective effects on peripheral nerve function . However , few epidemiological studies have examined the effect of dietary n-3 PUFA intake from fish consumption on peripheral nerve function , and none have controlled for co-occurrence of methylmercury exposure from fish consumption . OBJECTIVES We evaluated the effect of estimated dietary n-3 PUFA intake on peripheral nerve function after adjusting for biomarkers of methylmercury and elemental mercury in a convenience sample of 515 dental professionals . METHODS We measured sensory nerve conduction ( peak latency and amplitude ) of the median , ulnar and sural nerves and total mercury concentrations in hair and urine samples . We estimated daily intake ( mg/day ) of the total n-3 PUFA , n-3 docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , and n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) based on a self-administrated fish consumption frequency questionnaire . We also collected information on mercury exposure , demographics and other covariates . RESULTS The estimated median intakes of total n-3 PUFA , n-3 EPA , and n-3 DHA were 447 , 105 , and 179 mg/day , respectively . The mean mercury concentrations in urine ( 1.05 Î¼g/L ) and hair ( 0.49 Î¼g/g ) were not significantly different from the US general population . We found no consistent association between n-3 PUFA intake and sensory nerve conduction after adjusting for mercury concentrations in hair and urine although some positive associations were observed with the sural nerve . CONCLUSIONS In a convenience sample of dental professionals , we found little evidence suggesting that dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs from fish has any impact on peripheral nerve function after adjustment for methylmercury exposure from fish and elemental mercury exposure from dental amalgam .	11 24 12 127 1 244 123 243 112 2
22739680	To address the knowledge gaps regarding inhalation exposure of flight crew to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) on airplanes , we measured PBDE concentrations in air samples collected in the cabin air at cruising altitudes and used Bayesian Decision Analysis ( BDA ) to evaluate the likelihood of inhalation exposure to result in the average daily dose ( ADD ) of a member of the flight crew to exceed EPA Reference Doses ( RfDs ) , accounting for all other aircraft and non-aircraft exposures . A total of 59 air samples were collected from different aircraft and analyzed for four PBDE congeners-BDE 47 , 99 , 100 and 209 ( a subset were also analyzed for BDE 183 ) . For congeners with a published RfD , high estimates of ADD were calculated for all non-aircraft exposure pathways and non-inhalation exposure onboard aircraft ; inhalation exposure limits were then derived based on the difference between the RfD and ADDs for all other exposure pathways . The 95th percentile measured concentrations of PBDEs in aircraft air were &lt;1% of the derived inhalation exposure limits . Likelihood probabilities of 95th percentile exposure concentrations &gt;1% of the defined exposure limit were zero for all congeners with published RfDs .	2 21 232 23
22748699	Human biomonitoring is an important tool for the evaluation of environmental exposure to contaminants . The data that are obtained from these studies might be compared to appropriate reference values ( RVs ) in a specific population . The RVs were derived from the rounded values of the upper limit of the 95th confidence interval of the 95th percentile for lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) and mercury ( Hg ) in blood from adults in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo ( MASP ) , Brazil to investigate the association between blood metals and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors . Blood samples from 653 nonsmoking blood donors without occupational exposure to the studied metals were collected in 2006 . Our evaluations distinguished a younger group ( 18-39 years ) and an older group ( 40-65 years ) . RVs in the younger group were 60 Î¼gPb/L and 4 Î¼gHg/L for men and 47 Î¼gPb/L and 4 Î¼gHg/L for women . RVs in the older group were 80 Î¼gPb/L and 5 Î¼gHg/L for men and 63 Î¼gPb/L and 6 Î¼gHg/L for women . The RV for Cd was 0.6 Î¼g/L for adults aged 18-65 years . Pb and Cd levels demonstrated a significant association with sex and age . Male blood contained 50% more Pb , and the older group exhibited 23% more Pb . Fish consumption and amalgam fillings were primarily related to Hg levels . RVs for lead were similar to the Czech Republic and Germany but higher than the US population . The RV for Cd in Brazil was well below the RVs of these countries . The RVs for Hg in Brazil were similar to the US but higher than Germany and the Czech Republic .	24 12 1 244 122 2 243
11386738	This study was undertaken to determine whether variations in concentrations of particulates in the ambient air of Montreal , Quebec , during the period 1984 to 1993 , were associated with daily variations in cause-specific daily mortality . Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of various measures of particles and gaseous pollutants . Total sulfate was also measured daily ( 1986-1993 ) at a monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city ( Sutton , Quebec ) . We used coefficient of haze ( COH ) , extinction coefficient , and sulfate from the Sutton station to predict fine particles and sulfate from fine particles for days that were missing . We estimated associations between cause-specific mortality and PM(2.5) , PM(10) , predicted fine particles and fine sulfate particles , total suspended particles , coefficient of haze , extinction coefficient , and total sulfate measured at the Sutton station . We selected a set of underlying causes of death , as recorded on the death certificates , as the endpoint and then regressed the logarithm of daily counts of cause-specific mortality on the daily mean levels for the above measures of particulates , after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series , non-Poisson dispersion , weather variables , and gaseous pollutants . We found positive and statistically significant associations between the daily measures of ambient particle mass and sulfate mass and the deaths from respiratory diseases and diabetes . The mean percentage change in daily mortality ( MPC ) , evaluated at the interquartile range for pollutants averaged over the day of death and the preceding 2 days , for deaths from respiratory diseases was MPC(COH)=6.90% ( 95% CI : 3.69-10.21% ) , MPC(Predicted PM2.5)= 9.03% ( 95% CI : 5.83- 12.33% ) , and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.64% ( 95% CI : 2.46-6.86% ) . For diabetes , the corresponding estimates were MPC(COH)=7.50% ( 95% CI : 1.96-13.34% ) , MPC(Predicted PM2.5)=7.59% ( 95% CI : 2.36-13.09% ) , and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.48% ( 95% CI : 1.08-7.99% ) . Among individuals older than 65 years at time of death , we found consistent associations across our metrics of particles for neoplasms and coronary artery diseases . Associations with sulfate mass were also found among elderly persons who died of cardiovascular diseases and of lung cancer . These associations were consistent with linear relationships . The associations found for respiratory diseases and for cardiovascular diseases , especially in the elderly , are in line with some of the current hypotheses regarding mechanisms by which ambient particles may increase daily mortality . The positive associations found for cancer and for diabetes may be understood through a general hypothesis proposed by Frank and Tankersley , who suggested that persons in failing health may be at higher risk for external insults through the failure of regulating physiological set points . The association with diabetes may be interpreted in light of recent toxicological findings that inhalation of urban particles in animals increases blood pressure and plasmatic levels of endothelins that enhance vasoconstriction and alter electrophysiology . Further research to confirm these findings and to determine whether they are causal is warranted .	2 231 23
23523729	Exposure to traffic-related particulate matter ( PM ) is considered a potential risk for cardiovascular events . Little is known about whether improving air quality in car can modify cardiovascular effects among human subjects during commuting . We recruited a panel of 60 healthy subjects to commute for 2 h by a car equipped with an air conditioning ( AC ) system during the morning rush hour in Taipei . Operation modes of AC system using outside air ( OA-mode ) , circulating inside air ( IA-mode ) and turning off ( Off-mode ) were examined . Repeated measurements of heart rate variability ( HRV ) indices , PMâ¤2.5 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5 ) and noise level were conducted for each participant in different modes during the commute . We used linear mixed-effects models to associate HRV indices with in-car PM2.5 . We found that decreases in HRV indices were associated with increased levels of in-car PM2.5 . For Off-mode , an interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in in-car PM2.5 with 15-min moving average was associated with 2.7% and 4.1% decreases in standard deviation of NN intervals ( SDNN ) and the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals ( r-MSSD ) , respectively . During OA and IA modes , participants showed slight decreases in SDNN ( OA mode : 0.1% ; IA mode : 1.3% ) and r-MSSD ( OA mode : 1.1% ; IA mode : 1.8% ) by an IQR increase in in-car PM2.5 with 15-min moving average . We concluded that in-car PM2.5 is associated with autonomic alteration . Utilization of the car's AC system can improve air quality and modify the effects of in-car PM2.5 on HRV indices among human subjects during the commute .	11 23 1 2 112 232
22771078	To perform sputum analysis for verification of pulmonary changes in premenopausal rural Indian women chronically exposed to biomass smoke during cooking.Three consecutive morning sputum samples were collected from 196 women ( median age 34 years ) cooking with biomass and 149 age-matched control women cooking with cleaner fuel liquefied petroleum gas . Smears made on slides were stained with Papanicolaou and Perl's Prussian blue . Airway oxidative stress was estimated as reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation ( by flow cytometry ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) level ( by spectrophotometry ) in sputum cells . Airway inflammation was measured as sputum levels of interleukin ( IL)-6 , -8 and tumor necrosis factor- alpha ( TNF-Î± ) . Particulate matter of diameter less than 10 ( PM10 ) was measured using laser photometer while benzene exposure was monitored by measuring trans , trans-muconic acid ( t,t-MA ) in urine by HPLC-UV . Compared with control , sputum of biomass users contained more neutrophils , lymphocytes , eosinophils , alveolar macrophages , and showed presence of ciliocytophthoria , Charcot-Leyden crystals , Curschmann's spiral . ROS generation was increased by 2-fold while SOD was depleted by 31% in biomass users . They also had higher sputum levels of IL-6 , -8 and TNF-Î± . Levels of PM10 and t,t-MA were 2.9- and 5.8-times higher in biomass-using women . PM10 and t,t-MA levels were positively associated with cellular changes in the sputum , markers of airway inflammation , and oxidative stress . Cooking with biomass alters sputum cytology , and increases airway inflammation and oxidative stress that might result in further amplification of the tissue damaging cascade in women chronically exposed to biomass smoke .	11 12 23 11122 1 1113 11123 111 1114 127 2 1112 232
23506159	Limited information exists on exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA ) by children , adults , and pregnant women in China . In the present study , we determined BPA concentrations in whole blood collected from 10 children ( 1-5 years ) , 40 women ( 30 pregnant and 10 nonpregnant ) , and 30 fetuses ( i.e. , cord blood ) . Further , to evaluate the relationship between urinary and blood BPA concentrations , paired specimens of blood and urine ( n = 50 pairs ) were collected from an adult population . BPA was found in 46% of all blood samples analyzed , with a geometric mean ( GM ) concentration of 0.19 ng/mL . BPA was found in 84% of urine samples from adults , with a GM concentration of 1.01 ng/mL [ 0.48 Î¼g/g creatinine ( Cr) ] . Gender and age were not good predictors of blood BPA concentrations . However , we did find that the creatinine-adjusted urinary BPA concentrations in females were significantly higher ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) than the concentrations found in males and that the blood BPA concentrations in children were significantly higher ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) than the concentrations found in adults . Among all adults , unadjusted urinary BPA concentrations ( i.e. , volume-based ) were inversely ( r = -0.312 , p &lt ; 0.05 ) correlated with age when an outlier value ( 8.70 ng/mL ) was excluded from analysis . Concentrations of BPA in urine ( creatinine-adjusted ) and blood were significantly correlated ( r = 0.571 , p &lt ; 0.01 ) , with concentrations measured in urine approximately an order of magnitude higher than the concentrations found in blood . The mean and GM values for ratios of concentration of BPA between blood and urine were 0.109 and 0.057 , respectively . The ratio of mean concentrations of BPA between cord blood and maternal blood was 0.108 . On the basis of urinary BPA levels , we estimated the total daily intake ( EDI ) of BPA by Chinese adults . The mean ( range ) EDIs of BPA by adult males and females in China were 0.041 ( &lt;0.005-0.224 ) and 0.048 ( &lt;0.005-0.151 ) ug/kg bw/day , respectively . The pregnant women who underwent intravenous drug administration immediately before delivery had significantly higher concentrations of BPA in their blood than did those who did not receive intravenous drug administration . This is the first study to document the occurrence of and human exposure to BPA by pregnant women and fetuses from China .	24 12 21 1 244 122 2 127
22791114	Metal contamination of urban soils and homegrown products has caused major concern . In Part 1 , we investigated the long-term effects of a former smelter on the degree of kitchen garden-soil contamination and the quality of the homegrown vegetables from these gardens . The results showed that the soils retained a high level of contamination and that a large proportion of the vegetables produced did not comply with the legislation on the levels of metals allowed for human consumption . The present study aims to assess the associated potential health risk to local inhabitants through consumption of homegrown vegetables and ingestion of soil particles using a land use-based approach . For lead ( Pb ) , the standard hazard quotient ( HQ)-based risk assessment method was used to determine the HQ . For cadmium ( Cd ) , the approach consisted of calculating the HQs and then deriving site-specific assessment criteria ( SSAC ) using the SNIFFER method . The results suggested that the exposure pathways considered should not engender any form of deleterious health effects for adults . For children , Pb was the main concern and induced a relatively high health risk through soil particle ingestion , and most total soil Cd concentrations exceeded the derived SSAC , in particular , through consumption of vegetables . The metal bioaccessibility in soils was incorporated into the methods to establish more realistic risk assessment measures . This study proposes an approach to integrate different human health risk assessment methods . Further investigations should complete the assessment to improve risk determination , e.g. , the determination of metal bioaccessibility in vegetables .	24 245 2 243
23500399	Chronic exposure to heavy metals has long been recognized as being capable to increase head and neck cancer incidence among exposed human populations . Head and neck cancer is a significant public health issue in Tunisia . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the concentrations of As , Cd , Cr and Ni in healthy and tumor tissues of head and neck cancer patients . Metal concentrations were determined in tumor and healthy tissues of 101 head and neck cancer patients , using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry . The As , Cd , Cr , and Ni levels in tumor tissues were 3.4 , 2.5 , 1.3 and 1.5 times higher than those of healthy tissues ( p&lt;0.05 ) , respectively . Tumor tissue metal levels were higher in men than in women . As and Cd levels in tumor and healthy tissue samples of patients smokers are significantly higher than those of non-smokers ( p&lt;0.05 ) . A strong effect of cumulative smoking as expressed in the number of pack per year , and tumor tissue Cd levels were positively associated with three groups of age ( &lt;40 , 51-60 and &gt;60 years ) in both never-smokers and ever-smokers ( &lt;20 and â¥20 pack per year ) . Healthy tissue Cd levels were negatively associated with age in those three groups of smokers . The highest Cd and Cr concentrations among both workers and non-workers were observed in tumor tissues . The Cd and Cr in tissues of farmers , bricklayers and painters were all significantly higher among the workers as compared with the non-workers group . Tissue metal levels have increased due to smoking and occupational exposure . Heavy metal exposure via tobacco smoking and occupational exposures may increase the risk of head and neck in the Tunisian population .	12 23 1 2 125 232
22851195	The aim of this study was to measure the concentrations of lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , copper ( Cu ) , iron ( Fe ) , and zinc ( Zn ) in deciduous teeth from children living in Jordan and to investigate the affecting factors . Deciduous teeth samples ( n = 320 , without fillings ) were collected from 5- to 12-year-old children and analyzed for Pb , Cd , Cu , Fe , and Zn using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry . A questionnaire was used to gather information on each child , such as sex , age , tooth type ( incisors , canines , and molars ) , tooth position within the mouth ( upper or lower jaw ) , caries status , presence of amalgam fillings inside the mouth , type of drinking water ( tap water , home purified water , and plant purified water ) , and zone of residence ( close to or far from heavy traffic roads ) . The mean concentrations of Pb , Cd , Cu , Fe , and Zn were 30.26 , 0.55 , 6.23 , 34.72 , and 128.21 Î¼g/g , respectively . Our results indicate that there is a clear relation between the concentrations of the metals analyzed in this study and tooth type , tooth position within the mouth , caries status , presence of amalgam fillings inside the mouth , and type of drinking water . No significant differences in the concentrations of the five metals analyzed were observed due to sex . Our results also show that no significant difference among Pb , Cd , Cu , Fe , and Zn concentrations and age among the ages of 5-6 , 7-8 , 9-10 , and 11-12 , except for Pb , which decreases at age 11-12 .	24 12 1 244 2 241 125
11419597	In a trial to assess the exposure of subjects in the pediatric age group to cadmium ( Cd ) pollution , serum Cd was estimated by atomic absorption spectrometry in 405 subjects , birth-18 years old , from Cairo City and its suburbs . Serum Cd mean concentrations were : 0.92 microg/l in 32 neonates ( birth-4 weeks ) ; 1.33 microg/l in 70 infants ( 4 weeks-2 years ) ; 1.11 microg/l in 100 children in the preschool period ( 2-6 years ) ; 1.34 microg/l in 103 primary school children ( 6-12 years ) ; and 1.24 microg/l in 100 adolescents ( 12-18 years ) . In neonates , serum Cd was higher in babies with weights and heights that remained below the 5th percentile for age . Breast-fed infants had a serum Cd geometric mean level ( 1.25 microg/l ) that was not in accordance to that of their mothers ' milk ( 0.52 microg/l , P &lt ; 0.001 ) , suggesting alternative routes of exposure . Environmental tobacco-smoke exposure was the most important determinant of Cd status in the school-aged children , the geometric mean being 1.42 microg/l in passive smokers vs. 1.2 microg/l in non-exposed children ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) . Moreover , adolescents who were active smokers had a significantly higher serum Cd level ( 1.7 microg/l ) as compared to non-smokers ( 1.2 microg/l ) . Gender did influence the Cd status in adolescents , being higher among males , probably related to smoking , or to the difference in lifestyle of adolescents according to gender in the community . Alpha-1-microglobulinuria was accompanied by a higher serum Cd concentration in the group of adolescents only , suggesting a subclinical renal effect after several years of cumulative exposure . The residential classification , whether urban or suburban , did not influence the serum Cd status ; neither did the present or past history of bronchial asthma . These findings certainly justify further evaluation of the problem of Cd pollution among Cairene individuals , knowing the long-term consequences of exposure to it . Systematic efforts for the proper disposal of Cd wastes and prevention of smoking in public places are recommended .	11 12 23 1 122 2 124 11123 111 1112 232
23461267	Saliva is a biological fluid that has not been used extensively as a biomonitoring tool in epidemiological studies . This study presents the arsenic ( As ) concentrations in saliva and urine samples collected from populations of West Bengal , India who had been previously exposed to high As levels in their drinking water . We found a significant ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) association between the Log transformed Daily Ingestion of As ( Î¼g day(-1) ) and the As concentration in saliva ( r = 0.68 ) . Additionally , As concentration of saliva and urine also had a significant positive correlation ( r = 0.60 , p &lt ; 0.05 ) . Male participants , smokers , and cases of skin lesion were independently and significantly associated with an increase in salivary As . Thus our findings show that saliva is a useful biomarker of As exposure in the study population . The study also advocates that measurement of the forms of As in saliva may additionally provide insight into the internal dose and any individual differences in susceptibility to As exposure .	24 12 1 2 241 125 127
11419761	An exposure risk assessment of workers in a refinery production unit was undertaken . Gasoline and its main components were investigated through environmental and biological monitoring . Measured variables were environmental benzene , toluene , pentane and hexane ; benzene and toluene in blood and urine ; tt-MA ( metabolite of benzene ) in urine . Multivariate statistical analysis of the data showed that worker's exposure to the above substances fell within the limits specified by organisations such as ACGIH . Also , biological values complied with reference values ( RV ) for non-occupationally-exposed population . Different values of biological variables were determined by separating smokers from non-smokers : smokers had hematic and urinary benzene values significantly higher than non-smokers . During a 3-yr sampling , it was possible to identify a significant decrease of benzene in the workplace air and of hematic benzene for non-smokers . The most exposed department , one in which tank-lorries were loaded , needs further investigation and extended monitoring .	12 23 1 122 2 127 232
11437459	The identification of host factors that are predictors of changes in serum polyhalogenated biphenyl contaminants over time has been a difficult challenge in epidemiologic studies of exposed individuals . Of particular concern are age at exposure , reproductive and lactational histories , and changes in body mass index . Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches , this study examined factors related to high initial serum PBB and PCB levels and changes in these levels over time among women of varying ages at exposure ( n=1772 ; age range&lt;1 to 45 years ) . In 1973 , PBB exposure occurred through consumption of farm products contaminated with PBB added to cattle feed . Exposures to PCBs began in 1941 through PCB-contaminated silo sealant deteriorating into animal feed . The Michigan Department of Public Health began enrolling participants in 1977 and has continued to follow them through annual updates . At enrollment , questionnaires were administered to obtain demographic , lifestyle , and anthropometric measurements , medical/reproductive and occupational histories , and contaminated food consumption patterns . Blood samples were collected for PBB and PCB analysis at enrollment for all participants ; additional serum tests were done on a subset of the population during follow-up . Median serum levels at enrollment were 2.0 ppb PBB and 5.0 ppb PCB . A decline in serum PBB level over an interval that ranged from 1 to 146 months ( median=31 ) was observed for 44.6% of the women ( median=1.0 ppb ) , while 12.2% showed an increase ( median=1.0 ppb ) . PCB levels declined in 50.3% of the women ( median=3.0 ppb ) while 12.2% increased ( median=2.0 ppb ) . Relative to women whose contaminant levels were stable , higher initial serum level was a predictor of decline for both PBB and PCB ( OR=1.66 , 95% CI 1.52-1.82 ; OR=3.26 , 95% CI 2.58-4.12 , respectively ) ; a yearly increase in interval between tests was related to declining PCBs ( OR=1.65 , 95% CI 1.46-1.87 ) . In addition , age&lt ; or =10 years at exposure ( OR=1.72 , 95% CI 1.03-2.86 ) and residence on a quarantined farm ( OR=1.40 , 95- CI 1.03-1.90 ) were predictors of a decrease in PBBs . Factors related to an increase in PBB levels were age&lt ; or =10 years at exposure ( OR=0.30 , 95% CI 0.10-0.96 ) and initial PBB level ( OR=1.24 , 95% CI 1.15-1.33 ) ; and for PCBs , high initial level ( OR=1.34 , 95% CI 1.17-1.53 ) and body mass index ( OR=1.07 , 95% CI 1.01-1.13 ) . One or more live births during the interval between tests were not related to changing levels of either contaminant ; breastfeeding data were not available for examination . Early age at exposure appears to be an important predictor of changes in serum PBB levels over time .	24 12 1 122 2 243
19648214	In the gold ornaments manufacturing cottage industries , the gold metal grain dust waste particles are recovered from mercury ( Hg ) amalgam . The results on air samples from these industries during the recovery process have shown a high prevalence of Hg vapor ( 42.7 mg/m(3) ) . The blood concentration of Hg is elevated ( 79.1 microg/L ) among workers when their blood samples are tested . The Hg toxicity is reflected in the reduction of glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity in RBC ( 49.317 mg/L of RBC ) when compared with the data from control subjects ( 68.536 mg/L of RBC ) . These values are statistically significant . This would suggest that the Hg poisoning in goldsmiths is due to exposure . The results are discussed with relation to preventive measures .	11 12 23 1113 1 122 2 111 232
22391508	BACKGROUND Individual genetic variation that results in differences in systemic response to xenobiotic exposure is not accounted for as a predictor of outcome in current exposure assessment models . OBJECTIVE We developed a strategy to investigate individual differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) as genetic markers associated with naphthyl-keratin adduct ( NKA ) levels measured in the skin of workers exposed to naphthalene . METHODS The SNP-association analysis was conducted in PLINK using candidate-gene analysis and genome-wide analysis . We identified significant SNP-NKA associations and investigated the potential impact of these SNPs along with personal and workplace factors on NKA levels using a multiple linear regression model and the Pratt index . RESULTS In candidate-gene analysis , a SNP ( rs4852279 ) located near the CYP26B1 gene contributed to the 2-naphthyl-keratin adduct ( 2NKA ) level . In the multiple linear regression model , the SNP rs4852279 , dermal exposure , exposure time , task replacing foam , age , and ethnicity all were significant predictors of 2NKA level . In genome-wide analysis , no single SNP reached genome-wide significance for NKA levels ( all p â¥ 1.05 Ã 10(-5) ) . Pathway and network analyses of SNPs associated with NKA levels were predicted to be involved in the regulation of cellular processes and homeostasis . CONCLUSIONS These results provide evidence that a quantitative biomarker can be used as an intermediate phenotype when investigating the association between genetic markers and exposure-dose relationship in a small , well-characterized exposed worker population .	1 2 12 125 22
17140638	Specific elements are bioconcentrated in human hair and nails , which have unique advantages of application in population monitoring studies thereby , recognized as biological tools for disease diagnosis and prevention . However , investigations are meager for relative element profile in hair and nails of same subjects . In this study , hair and nails were analyzed to find effects of age , sex , smoking habit , diet , urban and rural exposure gradients , occupation , and health on element levels . Scalp hair and fingernails were sampled along with a questionnaire from urban and rural subjects of New Delhi ; patients of hypertension , coronary heart disease , and diabetes were identified clinically . Cadmium , chromium , copper , nickel , lead and zinc concentrations were determined by AAS in both the samples ; CRM ( human hair powder ) analysis showed acceptable precision and accuracy in element measurement . In comparison to controls , Cr-H and Zn-H levels were lower respectively in female hypertensive and total hypertensive subjects , whereas , Zn-N and Cu-N were lower respectively in total CHD and diabetic subjects , and hypertensive and CHD urban subjects . Cd concentrations were higher in both the samples of tobacco smoking rural subjects than that of non-smokers . Farmers had lower Pb-H than rural businessmen did . Cr , Cu , Ni , and Zn concentrations were different due to rural and urban gradient but not to the influence of age , sex , and diet . Pb value was alone correlated between the paired samples . Thus , higher Cd levels in the smokers and lower Cr , Cu and Zn levels in the patients were observed .	11 12 23 1 123 112 2 232
17157358	OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to monitor and assess human exposure to pollution in the Arctic which presents a potential future health risk for the local populations . Epidemiological studies in Greenland have shown that human blood levels of several organic contaminants are very high , especially in the North where people depend on local food . In East Greenland ( Ittoqqortoormiit ( Scoresbysund) ) the population shows the highest blood levels of several persistent organic pollutants found in Arctic countries , especially PCB , the levels of which exceed Canadian guideline levels . As in other Arctic countries , the predominant source of these contaminants is the local diet . However , other factors such as smoking may influence the metabolism and thereby the accumulation of toxic substances . STUDY DESIGN This project is part of the human health program of the ongoing circumpolar " Artic Monitoring and Assessment Programme " . Lifestyle , anthropometric factors , and dietary survey results covering 500 men and women from 6 Greenlandic districts were analyzed along with other factors blood lipids , fatty acid profiles , heavy metals and concentrations of persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) . RESULTS The dietary survey showed that the traditional food on the average provided 20-30% of the total energy intake . However , the relative monthly meal intake of seal , whale , polar bear , fish and game , and the composition of imported food , varied between districts . Seal and polar bear intake , and , in particular all the plasma n-3 fatty acids , were significantly correlated with organic contaminant concentrations , ( betaHCH , chlordanes , DDTs , Hexachlorobenzene , Mirex , PCBs , and toxaphenes ) p&lt;0.01() . After adjusting for age , district , dietary factors or plasma n-3 fatty acids , smoking was significantly correlated with high levels of all the above mentioned POPs . CONCLUSION The main predictors of high contaminant levels in Greenland were age , district , male gender , smoking and high plasma n-3/n-6 ratio as a marker of high dietary intake of local marine mammals .	24 12 23 1 122 2 243 232
17158471	Ambient air pollutant exposure has been linked to childhood respiratory disease , but infants have received little study . The authors tested the hypotheses that subchronic and chronic exposure to fine particulate matter ( particulate matter &lt ; or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5) ) , nitrogen dioxide , carbon monoxide , and ozone increases risk of severe infant bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization . Study subjects were derived from linked birth-hospital-discharge records of infants born in 1995-2000 in the South Coast Air Basin of California . Cases with a hospital discharge for bronchiolitis in infancy were matched to 10 age- and gestational-age-matched controls . Exposures in the month prior to hospitalization ( subchronic ) and mean lifetime exposure ( chronic ) referenced to the case diagnosis date were assessed on the basis of data derived from the California Air Resources Board . In conditional logistic regression , only subchronic and chronic PM2.5 exposures were associated with increased risk of bronchiolitis hospitalization after adjustment for confounders ( per 10-microg/m3 increase , adjusted odds ratio = 1.09 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.04 , 1.14 ) for both ) . Ozone was associated with reduced risk in the single-pollutant model , but this relation did not persist in multipollutant models including PM2.5 . These unique US data suggest that infant bronchiolitis may be added to the list of adverse effects of PM2.5 exposure .	2 231 23
21413794	Indoor air concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) measured in 20 locations in Toronto ranged 0.008-16 ngÂ·m(-3) ( median 0.071 ngÂ·m(-3) ) and 0.8-130.5 ngÂ·m(-3) ( median 8.5 ngÂ·m(-3) ) , respectively . PBDE and PCB air concentrations in homes tended to be lower than that in offices . Principal component analysis of congener profiles suggested that electrical equipment was the main source of PBDEs in locations with higher concentrations , whereas PUF furniture and carpets were likely sources to locations with lower concentrations . PCB profiles in indoor air were similar to Aroclors 1248 , 1232 , and 1242 and some exterior building sealant profiles . Individual PBDE and PCB congener concentrations in air were positively correlated with colocated dust concentrations , but total PBDE and total PCB concentrations in these two media were not correlated . Equilibrium partitioning between air and dust was further examined using log-transformed dust/air concentration ratios for which lower brominated PBDEs and all PCBs were correlated with K(OA) . This was not the case for higher brominated BDEs for which the measured ratios fell below those based on K(OA) suggesting the air-dust partitioning process could be kinetically limited . Total emissions of PBDEs and PCBs to one intensively studied office were estimated at 87-550 ngÂ·h(-1) and 280-5870 ngÂ·h(-1) , respectively , using the Multimedia Indoor Model of Zhang et al . Depending on the air exchange rate , up to 90% of total losses from the office could be to outdoors by means of ventilation . These results support the hypotheses that dominant sources of PBDEs differ according to location and that indoor concentrations and hence emissions contribute to outdoor concentrations due to higher indoor than outdoor concentrations along with estimates of losses via ventilation .	24 2 232 242 23
12515690	The ability of questionnaires to predict children's exposure to pesticides was examined as part of the Minnesota Children's Pesticide Exposure Study ( MNCPES ) . The MNCPES focused on a probability sample of 102 children between the ages of 3 and 13 years living in either urban ( Minneapolis and St. Paul , MN ) or nonurban ( Rice and Goodhue Counties in Minnesota ) households . Samples were collected in a variety of relevant media ( air , food , beverages , tap water , house dust , soil , urine ) , and chemical analyses emphasized three organophosphate insecticides ( chlorpyrifos , diazinon , malathion ) and a herbicide ( atrazine ) . Results indicate that the residential pesticide-use questions and overall screening approach used in the MNCPES were ineffective for identifying and oversampling children/households with higher levels of individual target pesticides .	24 1 12 23 127 245 2 241 243 242 232
20619876	Benzene , toluene , m/p-xylene and o-xylene ( BTX ) are toxic volatile organic compounds and ubiquitous air pollutants . Smoking and consumer products are indoor sources of BTX , whereas traffic and industrial activities are primary sources contributing to outdoor levels of BTX . The aim of this study was to characterize exposure of children to BTX by personal air sampling using diffusive samplers and by analysis of end-exhaled air . For this study , 101 children of 10-11 years of age were recruited from four primary schools in Southern Turkey during the warm season ( May 2008 ) . Two schools were situated in a residential area near primary and secondary iron and steel works ( Payas ) and two schools were located in a non-industrialized city ( Iskenderun ) . The children and their parents were visited at home for an interview and to identify possible sources of BTX in the residence . Median concentrations of benzene determined by diffusive samplers were higher in Payas ( 4.1 microg/m(3) ) than in Iskenderun ( 2.7 microg/m(3) , p&lt;0.001 ) . For toluene , no differences were observed , whereas for xylene isomers air concentrations tended to be lower for children living in Payas . The median end-exhaled air concentrations were 8.2 , 29 , 3.8 , and 5.7 pmol/L for benzene , toluene , m/p-xylene and o-xylene , respectively ( Payas ) , and 6.9 , 25 , 4.9 , and 6.0 pmol/L , respectively ( Iskenderun ) . Concentrations of toluene in end-exhaled air were 50% higher in children living with household members who smoked indoors ( p&lt;0.05 ) and benzene in end-exhaled air was more than 3-fold higher for those children who were exposed to tobacco smoke inside a vehicle ( p&lt;0.001 ) . End-exhaled concentrations of benzene were also higher in children living in a residence with an attached garage ( p&lt;0.05 ) . These exposure modifying factors were not identified when using the results obtained with diffusive samplers .	12 23 1 2 125 233
21315328	Phthalates are multifunctional chemicals that are used in a variety of consumer products including cosmetic and personal care products . This study aims at determining phthalate levels in cosmetic and personal care products obtained from the Canadian market . Overall 252 products including 98 baby care products were collected at retail stores in several provinces across Canada in year 2007 . These products included fragrances , hair care products ( hair sprays , mousses , and gels ) , deodorants ( including antiperspirants ) , nail polishes , lotions ( body lotions and body creams ) , skin cleansers , and baby products ( oils , lotions , shampoos and diaper creams ) . Samples were extracted with different organic solvents , depending on the types of the products , followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) analysis . Of the 18 investigated phthalates , diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) , dimethyl phthalate ( DMP ) , diisobutyl phthalate ( DiBP ) , di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) were detected . The detection frequencies were in the following order : DEP ( 103 out of 252 products)&gt;DnBP ( 15/252)&gt;DiBP ( 9/252)&gt;DEHP ( 8/252)&gt;DMP ( 1/252 ) . DEP was detected in almost all types of surveyed products with the highest levels ( 25,542 Î¼g/g , equal to 2.6% ) found in fragrances . DnBP was largely present in nail polish products with the highest concentration of 24,304 Î¼g/g ( 2.4% ) . DnBP was also found in other products such as hair sprays , hair mousses , skin cleansers and baby shampoos at much lower concentrations ( 36 Î¼g/g and less ) . Levels of other detected phthalates were generally low in the products . Based on these values , daily dermal exposure dosage to five phthalates was estimated for three age groups , female adults ( 60 kg ) ; toddlers ( 0.5-4 years ) and infants ( 0-6 months ) , through the use of cosmetic and personal care products . The exposure estimation , however , was based on existing products use pattern data , instead of probabilistic model based population use distribution . For female adults , the maximal daily exposure of 78 Î¼g/kg bw/d was determined for DEP . The maximal daily exposure was much lower for the other four phthalates ( DEHP , 0.82 Î¼g/kg bw/d ; DnBP , 0.36 Î¼g/kg bw/d ; and DMP , 0.03 Î¼g/kg bw/d ) . The exposure for DiBP was not calculated due to its very low levels ( &lt;10 Î¼g/g ) in products . Toddlers and infants in this case had a maximal daily exposure to DEP of 20 and 42 Î¼g/kg bw/d , respectively .	2 22
12605940	To date , personal volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) exposure and residential indoor and outdoor VOCs levels have not been characterized in Korea . In this study , residential indoor and outdoor VOCs concentrations were measured and compared simultaneously with the personal exposure for each of 30 participants in a medium city , Asan , and in a metropolitan city , Seoul . Factors that influence personal VOCs exposures were assessed in relation to house characteristics and time activity information . All VOC concentrations were measured using passive samplers during a 24-h period and analyzed using GC-MS . Ten target VOCs were benzene , trichloroethylene , toluene , o-xylene , p-xylene , ethylbenzene , MIBK , n-octane , styrene , and 1,2-dichlorobenzene . Residential indoor and outdoor VOCs concentrations measured in Seoul were significantly higher than those in Asan . Indoor/outdoor ( I/O ) ratios for all target compounds ranged from 0.94 to 1.51 and I/O ratios of Asan were a little higher than those of Seoul . Results indicate that time activity information can be used to predict personal exposures , although such predictions will result in an over estimation compared to measured exposures . Factors which influence the indoor VOCs level and its personal exposure in relation to house characteristics included house age , indoor smoking , and house type .	2 233 232 23
12621898	Since the formation of acrylamide ( AA ) in the heating process of starch-containing food could be demonstrated and high contents of this substance were found in commercial food products , there is a great discussion about the possible human health risks connected with this dietary exposure . In order to determine the body burden of the general population in Germany caused by this uptake , we investigated the internal exposure to acrylamide and acrylonitrile in a group of 72 persons using haemoglobin adducts as parameters of biochemical effects . The collective was subdivided into non-smokers and smokers basing on the results of the smoking-specific acrylonitrile adduct ( N-cyanoethylvaline , CEV ) . The median value for the adduct of AA ( N-2-carbamoylethylvaline , AAV ) in 25 non-smokers was 21 pmol/g globin ( approximately 0.6 microgram/l blood ) with a 95 percentile of 46 pmol/g globin ( approximately 1.3 micrograms/l ) ( LOD : 12 pmol/g globin ) . The median level for AAV in smokers ( n = 47 ) was found to be 85 pmol/g globin ( approximately 2.3 micrograms/l blood ) with a 95 percentile of 159 pmol/g globin ( approximately 4.3 micrograms/l blood ) . Based on these results about 60 micrograms AA/d are taken up by adult non-smoking persons . According to calculations of WHO and US EPA this background exposure would lead to a cancer risk between 6 x 10(-4) and 3.6 x 10(-3) . Our results confirm a body burden to AA even in persons from the non-smoking general population in Germany that is most probably caused by dietary uptake . Smoking habits considerably contribute to the level of this adduct .	12 23 1 122 2 232
20354564	Diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) and di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) are used extensively in personal care products , including fragrances ( DEP ) and nail polish ( DnBP ) . Between May 2003 and July 2006 , we gathered questionnaire data on the use of seven product categories ( deodorant , perfume , hair spray , hair gel , nail polish/polish remover , liquid soap/body wash , and lotion/mist ) over 48âh during the third trimester of pregnancy from 186 inner-city women . A 48-h personal air sample was collected and analyzed for DEP and DnBP ; a maternal spot urine sample was collected and analyzed for their monoester metabolites , monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) and mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MnBP ) , respectively . In all , 97% of air samples and 84% of urine samples were collected within Â±2 days of the questionnaire . During the 48âh , 41% of women reported perfume use and 10% reported nail polish/polish remover use . In adjusted analyses , no association was seen between nail product use and air DnBP or urine MnBP concentrations . Women reporting perfume use had 2.3 times higher ( 95% CI 1.6 , 3.3 ) urinary MEP concentrations . Personal air DEP increased by 7% for each 25% increase in a composite indicator of the six other product categories ( P&lt;0.05 ) , but was not associated with perfume use . Air DEP was correlated with urine MEP concentrations only among non-perfume users ( r=0.51 , P&lt;0.001 ) . Results suggest that perfume use is a significant source of DEP exposure .	24 12 22 23 1 244 2 127 233
22652009	Quantifying dermal exposure to pesticides in farming systems in developing countries is of special interest for the estimation of potential health risks , especially when there is a lack of occupational hygiene regulations . In this paper we present the results of a dermal exposure assessment for the potato farming system in the highlands of Colombia , where farmers apply pesticides with hand pressure sprayers without any personal protective equipment . The fractioning of the pesticide , in terms of potential and actual dermal exposure , was determined via the whole-body dosimetry methodology , using the tracer uranine as pesticide surrogate , and luminescence spectrometry as analytical method . We assessed the three activities involved in pesticide management : preparation , application , and cleaning ; analyzed three types of nozzles : one with a standard discharge and two modified by farmers to increase the discharge ; and derived the protection factor given by work clothing . Our results suggest that to reduce the health risk , three aspects have to be considered : ( i ) avoiding the modification of nozzles , which affects the droplet size spectrum and increases the level of dermal exposure ; ( ii ) using adequate work clothing made of thick fabrics , especially on the upper body parts ; and ( iii ) cleaning properly the tank sprayer before the application activity .	2 22
22317810	BACKGROUND There is concern about possible effects of disinfection by-products on reproductive outcomes . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between maternal exposure to chlorination by-products and the risk of delivering a small for-gestational-age ( SGA ) neonate . METHODS We conducted a population-based case-control study in the QuÃ©bec City ( Canada ) area . Term newborn cases with birth weights &lt;10th percentile ( n = 571 ) were compared with 1925 term controls with birth weights â¥10th percentile . Concentrations of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids in the water-distribution systems of participants were monitored during the study period , and a phone interview on maternal habits was completed within 3 months after childbirth . We estimated chlorination by-products ingestion during the last trimester of pregnancy and trihalomethanes doses resulting from inhalation and dermal exposure . We evaluated associations between chlorination by-products in utero exposure and SGA by means of unconditional logistic regression with control of potential confounders . RESULTS When total trihalomethanes and the 5 regulated haloacetic acids concentrations were divided into quartiles , no clear dose-response relationship was found with SGA . However , increased risk was observed when haloacetic concentrations were above the fourth quartile and when either trihalomethanes or haloacetic acids concentrations were above current water standards ( adjusted OR= 1.5 [ 95% confidence interval = 1.1-1.9 ] and 1.4 [ 1.1-1.9 ] , respectively ) . Inhalation and dermal absorption of trihalomethanes did not contribute to this risk , but a monotonic dose-response was found with haloacetic acids ingestion . CONCLUSION Oral exposure to high levels of chlorination by-products in drinking water could be a risk factor for term SGA .	24 11 22 23 1 2 241 112
17497535	Formaldehyde , a natural component of all mammalian cells , is metabolized to carbon dioxide . It is a colorless gas used as a preservative and a reactant in chemical processes in a wide variety of commercial and consumer products . Toluene is an organic solvent also used in a wide variety of commercial and consumer products . There is a growing concern that chemical exposure from consumer products including cosmetics adds to the overall toxic exposure bioburden . This study was designed to quantify the actual amount of formaldehyde and toluene exposure to professional nail technicians and their customers during the application of cosmetic nail products containing either formaldehyde or toluene . Formaldehyde concentrations were measured on workers and consumers using treated silica gel absorption tubes . Formaldehyde concentrations varied between 0.0012 and 0.0038 ppm . The results of this study clearly demonstrate that neither workers nor consumers are at any additional risk from exposure to formaldehyde or toluene in cosmetic nail products beyond daily exposure from commercial products in a work setting and in the home .	24 244 2 22
17099323	BACKGROUND Nurses and other hospital workers are exposed to antineoplastic drugs during daily activities . Previous studies suggest that antineoplastic drugs at occupational exposure levels may be toxic to reproduction , but these studies are not consistent or conclusive . METHODS Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 4393 exposed and nonexposed nurses employed between 1990 and 1997 ( 79% response ) . Questions were asked about pregnancy outcome , work-related exposures , and lifestyle . Exposure to antineoplastic drugs was estimated using task-based dermal exposure measurements and self-reported task frequencies . Time to pregnancy was modeled using survival analysis , and odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated for other reproductive outcomes using multiple logistic regression analysis . Associations were further explored by nonparametric regression modeling . RESULTS Nurses highly exposed to antineoplastic drugs took longer to conceive than referent nurses ( adjusted hazard ratio = 0.8 ; CI = 0.6-0.9 ) . Exposure to antineoplastic drugs was associated with premature delivery ( OR per unit increase in ln[exposure] = 1.08 ; CI = 1.00-1.17 ) and low birth weight ( OR per unit increase in ln[exposure] = 1.11 ; 1.01-1.21 ) . Penalized smoothed spline plots corroborated these log-linear relations . Spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , congenital anomalies , and sex of offspring appeared not to be related to exposure to antineoplastic drugs . CONCLUSION Antineoplastic drugs may reduce fertility and increase poor neonatal outcomes among occupationally exposed oncology nurses .	11 1 2 22 112
17079692	Bladder cancer has been associated with exposure to chlorination by-products in drinking water , and experimental evidence suggests that exposure also occurs through inhalation and dermal absorption . The authors examined whether bladder cancer risk was associated with exposure to trihalomethanes ( THMs ) through ingestion of water and through inhalation and dermal absorption during showering , bathing , and swimming in pools . Lifetime personal information on water consumption and water-related habits was collected for 1,219 cases and 1,271 controls in a 1998-2001 case-control study in Spain and was linked with THM levels in geographic study areas . Long-term THM exposure was associated with a twofold bladder cancer risk , with an odds ratio of 2.10 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.09 , 4.02 ) for average household THM levels of &gt;49 versus &lt ; or =8 micro g/liter . Compared with subjects not drinking chlorinated water , subjects with THM exposure of &gt;35 micro g/day through ingestion had an odds ratio of 1.35 ( 95% confidence interval : 0.92 , 1.99 ) . The odds ratio for duration of shower or bath weighted by residential THM level was 1.83 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.17 , 2.87 ) for the highest compared with the lowest quartile . Swimming in pools was associated with an odds ratio of 1.57 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.18 , 2.09 ) . Bladder cancer risk was associated with long-term exposure to THMs in chlorinated water at levels regularly occurring in industrialized countries .	24 22 23 2 241 232
