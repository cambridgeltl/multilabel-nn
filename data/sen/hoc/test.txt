12239968-11	CONCLUSIONS Poor differentiation , submucosal invasion and large tumor size were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer .	1
12239968-10	Multivariate analysis showed that submucosal invasion correlated best with lymph node spread ( OR 10.25 , 95% CI : 2.10-49.96 ) , followed by tumor size larger than 4 cm ( OR 4.99 , 95% CI : 1.46-17.05 ) , and poorly differentiated histological subtype ( OR 3.31 , 95% CI : 1.16-9.45 ) .	11 1
23112334-4	These results suggest that T(regs) are important regulators of the homeostasis of CD8(+) T cell priming and play a critical role in the induction of high-avidity primary responses and effective memory .	
12239968-12	Macroscopic classification was not correlated with lymph node metastasis .	1 12
23112334-2	T(reg) depletion induced the activation and expansion of a population of low-avidity CD8(+) T cells because of overproduction of CCL-3/4/5 chemokines , which stabilized the interactions between antigen-presenting dendritic cells and low-avidity T cells .	
23112334-3	In the absence of T(regs) , the avidity of the primary immune response was impaired , which resulted in reduced memory to Listeria monocytogenes .	2 21
23112334-0	Although regulatory T cells ( T(regs) ) are known to suppress self-reactive autoimmune responses , their role during T cell responses to nonself antigens is not well understood .	
23112334-1	We show that T(regs) play a critical role during the priming of immune responses in mice .	2 21
22829774-4	Here we show that loss of ATRX protein and mutations in the ATRX gene are hallmarks of ALT-immortalized cell lines .	6 63 4 41
23245831-6	Reciprocally , short hairpin RNA-mediated suppression of TS and RR caused DNA damage and senescence in NHFs , although less efficiently than HRAS(G12V) .	61 42 4 6
22498909-2	To identify novel small-molecule inhibitors of 17β-estradiol ( E(2))-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation , we established a cell-based screen for inhibitors of E(2)-ERα induction of an estrogen response element ( ERE)(3)-luciferase reporter .	
23251664-8	In addition , Y-142 neutralized HB-EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERBB4 , and blocked their downstream ERK1/2 and AKT signaling .	
23251664-9	We also found that Y-142 inhibited HB-EGF-induced cancer cell proliferation , endothelial cell proliferation , tube formation , and VEGF production more effectively than cetuximab and CRM197 and that Y-142 was superior to bevacizumab in the inhibition of HB-EGF-induced tube formation .	7 711 71 9 92
12015983-4	Finally , mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence have a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects .	42 4
12015983-5	Therefore , cellular senescence contributes to treatment outcome in vivo .	42 4
23251664-2	We explored the therapeutic possibilities by characterizing the in vitro biological activity of anti-HB-EGF monoclonal antibody Y-142 .	
23251664-3	EGF receptor ( EGFR ) ligand and species specificities of Y-142 were tested .	
12015983-0	p53 and INK4a/ARF mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance , in part , by disabling apoptosis .	
12015983-1	We show that primary murine lymphomas also respond to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence program controlled by p53 and p16(INK4a) .	42 4
12015983-2	Hence , tumors with p53 or INK4a/ARF mutations-but not those lacking ARF alone-respond poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo .	
12015983-3	Moreover , tumors harboring a Bcl2-mediated apoptotic block undergo a drug-induced cytostasis involving the accumulation of p53 , p16(INK4a) , and senescence markers , and typically acquire p53 or INK4a mutations upon progression to a terminal stage .	42 63 4 6 8 81
12183433-10	These data suggest that Bmi-1 regulates telomerase expression in MECs and plays a role in the development of human breast cancer .	
23251422-0	Repetitive DNA sequences with the potential to form alternative DNA conformations , such as slipped structures and cruciforms , can induce genetic instability by promoting replication errors and by serving as a substrate for DNA repair proteins , which may lead to DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .	
22498909-4	Only 8 of 75 hits from the luciferase screen inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of ERα-positive MCF-7 and T47D cells but not control ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells .	
1470779-3	She underwent only cholecystectomy and was well without any therapy for the liver tumor up until March in 1991 when she was readmitted to our university hospital due to rapidly progressive liver dysfunction .	
22596188-1	Recently , AHR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer by virtue of its ability to modulate estrogen receptor-α ( ERα ) signalling and/or its ability to block cell proliferation .	
1470779-2	The serum AFP level was within normal range , and the tumor was diagnosed as hemangioma radiologically .	
22498909-5	Although 12% of compounds inhibited E(2)-ERα-stimulated proliferation in only one of the ERα-positive cell lines , 40% of compounds were toxic and inhibited growth of all the cell lines , and exhibited little or no ability to inhibit E(2)-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation .	
12223346-10	Thus 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment of Caco-2 cells results in activation of latent TGF-beta 1 , facilitated by the enhanced expression of IGF-IIR by this secosteroid .	
12223346-11	Also , 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) sensitized Caco-2 cells to growth inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1 , contributing to the inhibition of Caco-2 cell growth by this secosteroid .	
1470779-1	She was first admitted to our university hospital , complaining of general fatigue in December , 1988 , and cholelithiasis and liver cirrhosis with hepatic tumor in Segment 8 were diagnosed .	
12202630-9	Our results show that DMSO is a very powerful inducer of G(1) synchronization in CHO cells without detectable cytotoxic or genetic effects in cell populations released from G(1) arrest .	91 9
12202630-8	No detectable cytotoxicity or genetic damage were induced in G(1) released cells as revealed by the tests employed .	
22593693-8	Our results are at times not consistent with those published in the literature , stressing the concept that multicentric studies that harmonization methodology and the patient selection are vital .	
12202630-3	In this study we investigated the possibility of using DMSO to reversibly synchronize CHO cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and analysed whether toxic effects follow the arrest using growth curve , sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei assays .	
12202630-2	CHO cells are frequently used in cell biology and mutagenesis studies due to their good growth capacity and ease of manipulation but are very difficult to synchronize by serum starvation since they detach from monolayers when they reach confluence .	
12202630-1	We recently showed that DMSO induces a G(1) phase arrest in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , by restoring contact inhibition and preventing high density-dependent apoptosis .	
12202630-0	Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , a well-known differentiation inducer in several myeloid cells , also induces a reversible G(1) arrest in many cell lines .	
12202630-7	Furthermore , expression levels of p27 were down-regulated during G(1) progression and cyclin D3 and E expression patterns were similar to those observed after serum starvation .	511 5 51
12202630-6	In our experiments , >90% of cells grown for 96 h in presence of the drug were arrested in G(1) and synchronously re-entered S phase approximately 8-12 h after release .	91 9
12202630-5	We show that CHO cells are efficiently and reversibly arrested in G(1) by DMSO in concentrations ranging between 1 and 2% .	91 9
12202630-4	We carried out a kinetic analysis of the arrest by DMSO and re-entry into the cell cycle after drug release by cytofluorimetric analysis of DNA content and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation .	
1470779-5	Despite intensive care , she died of hepatic failure due to cirrhosis in a decompensation state .	
22498909-6	Representative compounds were evaluated in more detail , and a lead ERα inhibitor was identified .	
1470779-4	The size of the liver tumor was unchanged .	
22264502-2	MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this study , real-time q-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of PlncRNA-1 in 16 pairs CaP tissues and matched normal tissues , 14 pairs CaP tissues and BPH tissues , 4 CaP cell lines , including LNCaP , LNCaP-AI , PC3 , and C4-2 , and 2 normal prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PWR-1E .	
22264502-0	OBJECTIVE : Emerging evidences implicate long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are deregulated in cancer development .	
23209410-6	To test this hypothesis we used multiple strategies to examine repair of UV-induced DNA damage in mock and virus-infected fibroblasts .	
23209410-7	Comet assays indicated that repair was initiated , but was not completed in infected cells .	62 6
23209410-4	Others have shown that cells are incapable of processing exogenously introduced damage after infection .	
22264502-1	The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of new lncRNA , named PlncRNA-1 , in prostate cancer ( CaP ) pathogenesis .	
23209410-2	We believe this was in part due to partitioning of the damage response and double strand break repair components .	
23209410-3	After extraction of soluble proteins , the localization of these components fell into three groups : specifically associated with the viral replication centers ( RCs ) , diffused throughout the nucleoplasm and excluded from the RCs .	
23209410-0	Many viruses subvert the host cell's ability to mount and complete various DNA damage responses ( DDRs ) after infection .	
23209410-1	HCMV infection of permissive fibroblasts activates host DDRs at the time of viral deposition and during replication , but the DDRs remain uncompleted without arrest or apoptosis .	
23209410-8	Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent localization of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ( CPDs ) revealed that after 24 h of repair , CPDs were significantly reduced in viral DNA , but not significantly changed in the infected host DNA .	62 6
23209410-9	To further quantitate CPD repair , we developed a novel dual-color Southern protocol allowing visualization of host and viral DNA simultaneously .	
23293472-5	The present study has been aimed to explore the pro-inflammatory levels in prostate carcinoma patients by examining the serum levels of novel cytokine interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) expression in tobacco exposed population .	
23251422-4	When using chromosomally integrated constructs in M. smegmatis , direct repeats induced the perfect deletion of their intervening sequences above background .	
22205389-6	The impaired ability of V1727F agrin to activate MuSK and cluster AChRs , together with its increased affinity to \u03b1-dystroglycan , mimics non-neural ( z- ) agrin and are important determinants of the pathogenesis of the disease .	
22205389-4	Moreover , the V1727F mutation decreased agrin-induced clustering of the acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) in cultured C2 muscle cells by >100-fold , and phosphorylation of the MuSK receptor and AChR beta subunit by Surprisingly , the V1727F mutant also displayed increased binding to \u03b1-dystroglycan but decreased binding to a neural ( z+ ) agrin-specific antibody .	
22205389-5	Our findings demonstrate that agrin mutations can associate with a severe form of CMS and cause profound distortion of the architecture and function of the NMJ .	
22205389-2	A motor-point muscle biopsy demonstrated severe disruption of the architecture of the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) , including : dispersion and fragmentation of endplate areas with normal expression of acetylcholinesterase ; simplification of postsynaptic membranes ; pronounced reduction of the axon terminal size ; widening of the primary synaptic cleft ; and , collection of membranous debris material in the primary synaptic cleft and in the subsynaptic cytoplasm .	
22205389-3	Expression studies in heterologous cells revealed that the Q353X mutation abolished expression of full-length agrin .	
22205389-0	We describe a severe form of congenital myasthenic syndrome ( CMS ) caused by two heteroallelic mutations : a nonsense and a missense mutation in the gene encoding agrin ( AGRN ) .	
22205389-1	The identified mutations , Q353X and V1727F , are located at the N-terminal and at the second laminin G-like ( LG2 ) domain of agrin , respectively .	
22443054-4	RESULTS The levels of oxygen free radicals detected by EPR were increased with the increase of CdTe QDs .	a21 a2 a
23251422-5	Absence of HR further enhanced these perfect deletions , whereas absence of NHEJ or SSA had no influence , suggesting compromised replication fidelity .	
23266736-2	Results showed that treatment with γ-tocotrienol or sesamin alone induced a significant dose-responsive growth inhibition , whereas combination treatment with these agents synergistically inhibited the growth of +SA , MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells , while similar treatment doses were found to have little or no effect on normal ( mouse CL-S1 and human MCF-10A ) mammary epithelial cell growth or viability .	
20333571-10	These factors could be candidates for better survival stratification and the indicators of the need for adjuvant therapy in early stage lung cancer patients .	
23266736-0	γ-Tocotrienol and sesamin are phytochemicals that display potent anticancer activity .	
23266736-1	Since sesamin inhibits the metabolic degradation of tocotrienols , studies were conducted to determine if combined treatment with sesamin potentiates the antiproliferative effects of γ-tocotrienol on neoplastic mouse ( +SA ) and human ( MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 ) mammary cancer cells .	
23266736-6	Taken together , these findings indicate that the synergistic antiproliferative action of combined γ-tocotrienol and sesamin treatment in mouse and human mammary cancer cells is cytostatic , not cytotoxic , and results from G1 cell cycle arrest .	9 51 511 5 91
21152298-9	Notably , the expression of TGF-β1 , VEGF and b-FGF all increased in RMG-I-H cells .	9 92
21152298-8	Moreover , the tumor formation by RMG-I-H cells was inhibited by preincubating the cells with LeY mAb .	
21152298-7	When subcutaneously inoculated in nude mice , RMG-I-H cells produced large tumors , while mock-transfected cells RMG-I-C and the parental cells RMG-I produced small tumors .	
21152298-6	The results showed that the proliferation and adhesion in vitro were significantly inhibited by treatment of RMG-I-H cells with LeY mAb .	
21152298-5	Additionally , we examined the expression of TGF-β1 , VEGF and b-FGF in xenograft tumors .	
21152298-4	In the present study , we examined the proliferation , tumorigenesis , adhesion and invasion of the cell lines with treatment of LeY monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) .	
21152298-3	Previously , we transfected the ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I with the α1,2-fucosyltransferase gene to obtain stable transfectants , RMG-I-H , that highly express LeY .	
21152298-2	However , the effects of LeY on ovarian cancer are not yet clear .	
21152298-1	Overexpression of LeY is frequently observed in epithelial-derived cancers and has been correlated to the pathological staging and prognosis .	
21152298-0	Lewis y ( LeY ) antigen is a difucosylated oligosaccharide carried by glycoconjugates on the cell surface .	
23251664-0	Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) is a member of the epidermal growth factor family and has a variety of physiological and pathological functions .	
23264896-2	Thus , we hypothesized that inhibition of TLR4-NFκB signaling might help in limiting inflammatory responses and inflammation-induced oncogenesis .	
23251422-6	In contrast , inverted repeats induced perfect deletions only in the absence of SSA .	
23161172-8	Moreover , forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness .	11 1
23161172-9	Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression .	1 12
23264896-7	Changes in the expression of TLR4 , interleukin ( IL)-1β and IL-6 , in intracellular NFκB-related signal transducers ( IKBα , p65 , phosphorylated IKBα , phosphorylated p65 , RelB , COX-2 ) as well as in the transcriptional activity of NFκB were studied by immunocytochemistry , immunoblotting and NFκB reporter assay , respectively .	
19637241-10	We propose that Nucling deficiency could be a powerful tool to reveal the NF-kappaB-related molecular networks leading to hepatitis and HCC development .	
23251664-4	Neutralizing activities of Y-142 against HB-EGF were evaluated in EGFR and ERBB4 signaling .	
23264896-6	Cells were then treated with varying amounts of the SPA4 peptide .	
23251664-5	Biological activities of Y-142 were assessed in cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis assays and compared with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab , the HB-EGF inhibitor CRM197 , and the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) antibody bevacizumab .	
23131583-4	Our results showed that expression of NHD13 fusion gene resulted in impaired NHEJ-mediated DNA break repair .	62 6
22819295-5	Thus , all heteroplasmic ( >%10 ) and homoplasmic variations were determined ( except for 727C insertion ) and classified according to the associations with mitochondrial diseases .	
22819295-4	The whole mitochondrial genome was sequenced with average depth of coverage per sample with next-generation sequencing technology .	
22819295-3	Here , we report the results of whole mitochondrial genome analysis of a family with m.8993T>C mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene and associated with NARP/MILS , and discuss the familial inheritance , effects of variation in combinations and heteroplasmy levels on the clinical findings .	
22819295-2	Clinical heterogeneity has mostly been attributed to mtDNA heteroplasmy , but environmental , autosomal , tissue-specific factors , nuclear modifier genes , and mtDNA variations may also modulate disease expression .	
22819295-1	The rare T8993C mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene is generally considered to be clinically milder , but there is marked clinical heterogeneity ranging from asymptomatic carriers to fatal infantile Leigh syndrome .	
22819295-0	Mutations in mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) encoded nucleotide 8993 can cause NARP syndrome ( neuropathy , ataxia , and retinitis pigmentosa ) or MILS ( maternally inherited Leigh syndrome ) .	
23264896-0	Inflammation is a major risk factor for carcinogenesis in patients affected by chronic colitis , yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from chronic inflammation to cancer are not completely understood .	
23251664-7	Y-142 recognized HB-EGF as well as the EGFR ligand amphiregulin , and bound specifically to human HB-EGF , but not to rodent HB-EGF .	
23197380-8	Immunofluorescence analysis of AQP1 siRNA treated tumours showed a significantly lower microvessel density .	7 71
23197380-9	Time course experiments demonstrated that repeated injections of AQP1 siRNA over time are effective in sustaining the inhibition of tumour growth .	
22705236-8	In addition , reduced Hes1 protein expression is accompanied by a shorter time to recurrence after curative resection , suggesting that Hes1 may represent a biomarker for prediction of patients with poor prognosis .	
22705236-2	In line with these data , we report that CDKN1C/P57 is a target of transcriptional repression by the Notch effector , Hes1 .	
22705236-3	We found that the up-regulation of CDKN1C/P57 by cDNA transfection decreased tumor growth , as determined by growth curve , flow cytometry analysis , and cyclin D1 down-regulation , without affecting the apoptosis machinery .	
22705236-0	CDKN1C/P57 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in different human cancers , including hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ; however , little is known regarding the role of CDKN1C/P57 and its regulation in HCC .	
22705236-1	In this study , we show that the down-regulation of Notch1 and Notch3 in two HCC cell lines resulted in Hes1 down-regulation , CDKN1C/P57 up-regulation , and reduced cell growth .	
22705236-6	Evaluation of senescence in cells depleted both for Hes1 and CDKN1C/P57 revealed that the senescent state really depends on the accumulation of CDKN1C/p57 .	42 4
22705236-7	Finally , we validated our in vitro results in primary HCCs , showing that Hes1 protein expression inversely correlates with CDKN1C/P57 mRNA levels .	
22705236-4	Indeed , the expression of Bax , Noxa , PUMA , BNIP(3) , and cleaved caspase-3 was not affected by CDKN1C/P57 induction .	8 81
22705236-5	Morphologically CDKN1C/p57-induced HCC cells became flat and lengthened in shape , accumulated the senescence-associated β-galactosidase marker , and increased P16 protein expression .	42 4
23161172-2	We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system .	
22614006-4	In addition , ectopic KIBRA expression antagonizes YAP via the serine 127 phosphorylation site and we show that KIBRA , Willin and Merlin differentially regulate genes controlled by YAP .	
22614006-5	Finally , reduced KIBRA expression in primary breast cancer specimens correlates with the recently described claudin-low subtype , an aggressive sub-group with EMT features and a poor prognosis .	
23161172-3	Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells .	91 9
22614006-0	The Salvador/Warts/Hippo ( Hippo ) signaling pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell contact inhibition , organ size control , cell growth , proliferation , apoptosis and cancer development in mammals .	
22614006-1	The upstream regulation of this pathway has been less well defined than the core kinase cassette .	
22614006-2	KIBRA has been shown to function as an upstream member of the Hippo pathway by influencing the phosphorylation of LATS and YAP , but functional consequences of these biochemical changes have not been previously addressed .	
22614006-3	We show that in MCF10A cells , loss of KIBRA expression displays epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) features , which are concomitant with decreased LATS and YAP phosphorylation , but not MST1/2 .	11 1
19836430-7	This increase in Cdc42 was concomitant with its increased interaction with scaffold protein IQGAP-1 .	
19836430-6	TNFalpha altered actin cytoskeletal organization and increased Cdc42 levels .	
19836430-5	TNFalpha mediated increase in Akt phosphorylation was dependent on oxidative stress as Akt phosphorylation was abrogated in the presence of ROS inhibitor and elevated in cells transfected with SOD-1 siRNA .	a21 a2 a
19836430-4	Increased in Akt phosphorylation was concurrent with the decrease in ROS scavenger SOD-1 levels .	a21 a2 a
19836430-3	Treatment with TNFalpha elevated Akt phosphorylation in glioma cells .	
19836430-2	As both TNFalpha and oxidative stress independently play role in regulating cytoskeletal organization and cell survival pathways we investigated whether TNFalpha mediated oxidative stress regulates responses that offer survival advantages to glioblastoma cells .	
19836430-1	The pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNFalpha ) elevates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .	
19836430-0	Inflammation which is an indispensable participant in tumor progression is intricately linked with redox modulation .	
19655166-2	METHODS We analysed 55 breast cancer specimens , 26 adjacent ductal carcinomas in situ ( DCIS ) and 23 adjacent normal breast tissues for expression of glycolytic markers by immunohistochemistry .	
19655166-3	RESULTS We found expression of pAkt in 49% , GLUT1 in 25% , M2PK in 68% and TKTL1 in 31% of the tumours investigated .	
19655166-0	PURPOSE Metabolic dependence on glucose utilisation has been described for different tumours characterised by activation of Akt , upregulation of GLUT1 , M2PK and TKTL1 .	
19655166-1	To date , however , little is known about glucose metabolism in breast cancer tissue .	
19655166-6	Surprisingly , M2PK expression was highest in normal breast tissue .	
19655166-7	CONCLUSIONS We found a glycolytic phenotype in a high percentage of breast cancer samples .	31 3
19836430-9	Importantly , Akt inhibition not only reversed TNFalpha mediated changes in actin cytoskeletal organization but also abrogated anchorage independent growth .	
19655166-5	Expression of pAkt , GLUT1 and TKTL1 were higher in breast cancer and DCIS than in normal tissue .	
23251422-9	Thus , direct and inverted repeats may elicit genetic instability in mycobacteria by 1 ) directly interfering with replication fidelity , 2 ) stimulating the three main DSB repair pathways , and 3 ) enticing L5 site-specific recombination .	
23082126-7	Lactate activates HIF-1 and triggers tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo , an activity that we found to be under the specific upstream control of the lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) expressed in tumor cells .	7 71
21179939-5	There was no increased gene expression for GST .	
23082126-6	These data were confirmed using genotypically matched oxidative and mitochondria-depleted glycolytic tumor cells as well as several different wild-type human tumor cell lines of either metabolic phenotype .	
23276719-5	To assess the role of Necl-5 in the invasive activity of the BAC cells , we knocked down its expression using RNA interference ( RNAi ) .	11 1
23082126-5	We report that lactate , the end-product of glycolysis , inhibits prolylhydroxylase 2 activity and activates HIF-1 in normoxic oxidative tumor cells but not in Warburg-phenotype tumor cells which also expressed lower basal levels of HIF-1\u03b1 .	31 3
12139732-7	Reduced immunosuppression in solid organ transplant patients resulted in resolution of disease in 14/24 , which was sustained in 11 .	2 22
12139732-6	Thirty-five patients were evaluable for clonality ; 24 were monoclonal and 11 were polyclonal .	
12139732-5	Twenty-four out of 38 evaluable cases were Epstein-Barr virus positive .	
12139732-4	Using the Pittsburgh classification , 9 were lymphadenopathic , 10 were systemic , 25 were lymphomatous and , with the Murphy grouping for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( NHL ) , 10 were localized and 32 non-localized .	
12139732-3	Using the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms , 5 were B lymphoblastoid , 24 were high-grade B and 14 were other subtypes .	
12139732-2	Pathology was centrally reviewed and showed polymorphic features in 5 cases , monomorphic in 23 , mixed pattern in 5 patients and 9 other types .	
12139732-1	Ages ranged from 10 months to 17 years and there were 15 girls .	
12139732-0	Clinical data and biological samples were prospectively collected in 42 children with lymphoproliferative disease ( LPD ) secondary to organ/bone marrow transplant-related immunosuppression ( 30 : 11 liver , 10 heart/lung , 8 kidney and 1 bone marrow ) , other drug-induced immunosuppression ( 2 ) , congenital immunodeficiency ( 8 ) or human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)-related immune dysfunction ( 2 ) .	
23082126-3	It stimulates the expression of glycolytic transporters and enzymes supporting high rate of glycolysis .	
12139732-9	Seven out of 29 solid organ transplant and 10/13 other immune-deficient patients died .	
12139732-8	Nineteen patients received chemotherapy , 14/18 evaluable responded , which was sustained in 8 cases .	
1384375-5	The metastases were discovered from six to 52 years following the occurrence of the primary tumor .	1 12
1384375-4	With one exception , all the patients had at least a single recurrences of their primary mixed tumor , but two or more recurrences were the norm before development of metastatic foci .	1 12
1384375-7	The metastases either occurred simultaneously with an episode of recurrent mixed tumor ( n = 5 ) or from 5 to 29 years after a recurrence ( n = 6 ) .	1 12
1384375-6	Metastatic deposits were identified in bone , lung , regional lymph nodes , skin , kidney , retroperitoneum , oral cavity , pharynx , calvarium , and central nervous system .	1 12
1384375-1	We report the clinicopathologic features and flow cytometric findings for 11 cases of MZMT .	
1384375-0	Among salivary gland neoplasms are a group of rare tumors that are histologically identical to benign mixed tumors that inexplicably metastasize ; they have been called metastasizing mixed tumor ( MZMT ) of salivary glands .	
1384375-3	Primary sites of involvement included the parotid gland ( eight cases ) , submandibular gland ( two cases ) , and the nasal septum ( one case ) .	
1384375-2	At the time of discovery of metastatic disease , the patients , six women and five men , ranged in age from 20 to 83 years .	
22948179-3	Enhanced SHH signaling by recombinant human SHH N-terminal peptide ( rSHH-N ) promoted hepatoma cell adhesion , migration and invasion , whereas blockade of SHH signaling with SHH neutralizing antibody or cyclopamine suppressed hepatoma cell adhesion , migration and invasion .	11 1
22948179-2	In this study , we found that SHH signaling was activated and correlated with invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .	
22948179-1	However , the roles and underlying mechanisms of SHH signaling pathway in invasion and metastasis of liver cancer have not been well understood .	
22948179-0	The aberrant activation of sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) pathway contributes to initiation and progression of various malignancies .	
1384375-9	Follow-up , ranging from 8 months to 16 years following the diagnosis of MZMT , revealed seven patients to be alive without disease ( 64% ) and two dead of causes unrelated to metastatic disease ( 18% ) .	1 12
1384375-8	The treatment of the primary , recurrent , and metastatic neoplasms was surgical excision .	
22948179-5	The rSHH-N-mediated hepatoma cell migration and invasion was blocked by MMP-specific inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies to MMP-2 and MMP-9 .	11 1
22948179-4	Furthermore , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities were upregulated and downregulated by rSHH-N and SHH signaling inhibitor , respectively .	
12716464-4	Emodin generated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in these cells which brought about a reduction of the intracellular mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( DeltaPsim ) , followed by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 , leading to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis .	a21 a2 a 8 81
12716464-5	Our findings demonstrate that ROS and the resulting oxidative stress play a pivotal role in apoptosis .	a21 a2 a 8 81
12716464-6	Preincubation of hepatoma cell lines with the hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzyme , catalase ( CAT ) and cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , partially inhibited apoptosis .	a21 a2 a 8 81
12716464-7	These results demonstrate that enhancement of generation of ROS , DeltaPsim disruption and caspase activation may be involved in the apoptotic pathway induced by emodin .	a21 a2 a 8 81
12716464-0	Previous experiments have shown that emodin is highly active in suppressing the proliferation of several tumor cell lines .	
12716464-1	However , it is not clear that emodin can induce growth inhibition of hepatoma cells .	
12716464-2	We have found that emodin induces apoptotic responses in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines ( HCC ) Mahlavu , PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 .	8 81
12716464-3	The addition of emodin to these three cell lines led to inhibition of growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner .	
22389691-7	Strikingly , insertion events in tobacco were associated with large genomic deletions at the site of the DSB that resulted in increased micro-homology at the sequence junctions suggesting the involvement of a non-classical NHEJ repair pathway .	
22389691-6	Approximately of the observed repair events contained larger deletions ( >20 bp ) and a similar percentage contained insertions .	
22389691-5	The majority of repair events resulted in no loss of sequence and small ( 1-20 bp ) deletions occurred at a minority ( 25-45% ) of repair junctions .	
22389691-4	In contrast to previously published variation in DSB repair between Arabidopsis and tobacco , the two species displayed similar DSB repair profiles in our experiments .	
22389691-3	Using this process over 300 NHEJ repair junctions were analysed in each species .	
22389691-2	We investigated NHEJ in Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) by introducing DNA double-strand breaks through inducible expression of I-SceI , followed by amplification of individual repair junction sequences by single-molecule PCR .	
22389691-1	These potentially lethal DNA lesions are repaired efficiently by two major DSB repair pathways : homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) .	
22389691-0	DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) occur constantly in eukaryotes .	
23276719-3	The expression of Necl-5 was higher in BAC cells than in fibroblasts .	
23255900-1	Previous studies have demonstrated that interleukin 21 ( IL-21 ) is a promising cytokine for cancer immunotherapy due to its ability to induce the immunity of T cells and natural killer cells , whereas blockade of the interaction of programmed death receptor-1 ( PD-1 ) with its ligand ( PD-L1 ) reduces peripheral tolerance .	
23255900-0	Cancer immunotherapies are designed to elicit T-cell responses that inhibit tumor growth .	
24139416-5	We established lymph node metastasis models and treated animals with H22 tumors with Lip-mSurvivinT34A ( Lip-mS ) , Lip-plasmid ( Lip-P ) , or normal saline ( NS ) .	
23251422-3	All three genomes are strongly enriched in direct repeats and modestly enriched in inverted repeats .	
23255900-3	The naked plasmids pmIL-21 and/or psPD-1 were used for local gene transfer by injection .	
23082126-8	Because MCT1 also gates lactate-fueled tumor cell respiration and mediates pro-angiogenic lactate signaling in endothelial cells , MCT1 inhibition is confirmed as an attractive anticancer strategy in which a single drug may target multiple tumor-promoting pathways .	31 7 71 3
22970388-10	Conclusions .	
22970388-11	PIK3CA mutations occur frequently in breast cancer bone metastases .	63 1 12 6
22970388-12	The PIK3CA mutation status in bone metastases samples appears to reflect the PIK3CA mutation status in the primary tumour .	63 1 12 6
22970388-13	Breast cancer patients with bone metastases may be candidates for treatment with selective PIK3CA inhibitors .	1 12
23093405-9	These results are compared with other studies targeting glycolytic enzymes with RNAi in the context of cancer cell proliferation and suggest that aldolase may be a useful target in the treatment of cancer .	31 3
23093405-8	Consistent with this hypothesis , aldolase knockdown cells show increased multinucleation .	
23276719-0	Nectin-like molucule-5 ( Necl-5 ) is an immunoglobulin-like molecule that was originally identified as a poliovirus receptor and is often upregulated in cancer cells .	
23093405-1	Several ( but not all ) glycolytic enzymes have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment using RNAi .	
22495714-0	BACKGROUND Adenosine receptors ( A1 , A2A , A2B , A3 ) play an important role in the regulation of growth , proliferation and death of cancer and normal cells .	
23093405-3	Of these enzymes , knockdown of aldolase causes the greatest effect , inhibiting cell proliferation by 90% .	
23093405-2	Here , four previously untargeted glycolytic enzymes , aldolase A , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , triose phosphate isomerase , and enolase 1 , are targeted using RNAi in Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells .	
23093405-5	However , aldolase knockdown does not affect glycolytic flux or intracellular ATP concentration , indicating a non-metabolic cause for the cell proliferation defect .	
23093405-4	This defect is rescued by expression of exogenous aldolase .	
23093405-7	One possible model for how aldolase knockdown may inhibit transformed cell proliferation is through its disruption of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics in cell division .	
23093405-6	Furthermore , this defect could be rescued with an enzymatically dead aldolase variant that retains the known F-actin binding ability of aldolase .	
20100566-1	Photoactivated MVP carries an important load in peroxides , but their cellular effects have not yet been determined .	
22864932-2	Data were collected on age ; tumor size , grade , and nodal stage ; estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and human endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) ; extensive intraductal component ; lymphovascular invasion ; margins ; and reexcision findings .	
1384375-14	Retrospective analysis of histologic parameters ( mitotic rate , cellular pleomorphism , infiltrative growth , vascular or lymphatic invasion ) and flow cytometric analysis failed to identify criteria to predict the development of metastasis in these neoplasms .	1 12
23430509-8	This cell line may be useful to study the chemoresistant mechanisms of CCC and contribute to novel treatment strategies .	
1384375-11	Flow cytometric analysis revealed a diploid DNA cell population in the primary and/or metastatic tumors in nine cases .	1 12
1384375-10	Two patients ( 18% ) died as a direct result of metastatic tumor at 3 and 2 years after metastasis of their mixed tumors .	1 12
1384375-13	DNA ploidy levels and cell proliferation rates were compared with those of conventional benign mixed tumors and also with malignant mixed tumors .	6
1384375-12	Aneuploid DNA cell content was identified in two of the cases .	6
12537564-10	Genes located in regions of frequent cytogenetic change were examined for changed expression in the HCC samples .	
12537564-11	CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that CGMA predictions using gene-expression microarray datasets are a practical alternative to CGH profiling .	
12537564-12	In addition , CGMA might be useful for identifying candidate genes within cytogenetically abnormal regions .	6
21129360-5	Overall , these data support the notion that ΔNp63α/IRF6 interplay regulates NOS2 transcription , thereby underlying the autophagic-related cancer cell response to tobacco exposure .	82 8
21129360-4	Furthermore , both mainstream ( MSE ) and sidestream ( SSE ) smoking extracts induced changes in expression of autophagic marker , LC3B , while siRNA against ΔNp63α , IRF6 and NOS2 modulated these autophagic changes .	82 8
21129360-1	Cigarette smoke exposure was shown to induce the expression of the ΔNp63α and nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)-2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and immortalized oral keratinocytes .	
21129360-0	Tobacco-induced oxidative stress leads to chronic inflammation and is implicated in the development of many human epithelial cancers , including head and neck cancer .	
21129360-3	Small interfering ( si)-RNAs against both ΔNp63α and IRF6 decreased the induction of NOS2 promoter-driven reporter luciferase activity and were shown to inhibit NOS2 activity .	
21129360-2	The NOS2 promoter was found to contain various cognate sequences for several transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor ( IRF)-6 and p63 , which were shown in vivo binding to the NOS2 promoter in response to smoke exposure .	
23277562-5	However , they showed elevated basal tissue and serum cytokine levels , indicating low-level inflammation before the development of tumors .	a a2
23277562-4	These mice did not display deficiencies in known roles of SMG1 , including nonsense-mediated decay .	
23277562-7	These data suggest that the inflammation observed in Smg1 haploinsufficiency contributes to susceptibility to cancer and that Smg1-deficient animals represent a model of inflammation-enhanced cancer development .	a a2
23277562-6	Smg1 heterozygous mice also showed evidence of oxidative damage in tissues .	61 6
23277562-1	SMG1 has a well-characterized role in nonsense-mediated decay as well as suggested roles in the DNA damage response , resistance to oxidative stress , regulation of hypoxic responses , and apoptosis .	
23277562-0	SMG1 is a member of the phosphoinositide kinase-like kinase family of proteins that includes ATM , ATR , and DNA-PK , proteins with known roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses .	
23277562-3	Smg1 homozygous KO mice were early embryonic lethal , but Smg1 heterozygous mice showed a predisposition to a range of cancers , particularly lung and hematopoietic malignancies , as well as development of chronic inflammation .	a a2
23277562-2	To understand the roles of SMG1 further , we generated a Genetrap Smg1 mouse model .	
23151902-5	However , AR-42 predominantly arrested Ben-Men-1 cells at G2/M , while inducing cell-cycle arrest at G1 in meningeal cells .	
20980775-3	S phase delay with a subsequent G2/M arrest was observed in Capans in response to BG + TMZ .	9 51 511 5 91
20980775-2	RESULTS The wt-p53 human pancreatic tumor cell line Capan-2 and p53-efficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were more responsive to treatment with TMZ + BG than mutant p53 Capan-1 and p53-null MEFs .	
20980775-1	METHODS The effects of TMZ and BG on apoptosis , cell growth , the mitotic index , cell cycle distribution , and protein expression were studied by TUNEL , cell counting , flow cytometry , and Western blot analysis , respectively .	
20980775-0	BACKGROUND Though an increased efficacy of carmustine and temozolomide ( TMZ ) has been demonstrated by inactivation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) with O(6)-benzyl-guanine ( BG ) in human pancreatic tumors refractive to alkylating agents , the regulatory mechanisms have not been explored .	
20980775-7	CONCLUSION p53 provokes a classic proapoptotic response by delaying G1-to-S progression , but it may also facilitate cell killing by enhancing MMR-related cell cycle arrest and cell death .	9 51 511 5 91 8 81
20980775-6	There was an early induction of MMR proteins in p53-efficient lines .	
20980775-5	The effect of p53 on BG + TMZ toxicity was supported by a marked change in apoptosis when p53 function was restored/inactivated .	
20980775-4	The G1-to-S transition delay in Capan-2 was associated with p53-dependent apoptosis and was distinctly different from the presumed mismatch repair ( MMR ) killing operative during the G2/M arrest .	9 51 511 62 5 6 91 8 81
20100566-2	We hypothesized that these peroxides may elicit a DNA-damage response .	
23291854-7	We concluded that NBS1 is responsible for estradiol-mediated protection from double-strand breaks in ER+ breast cancer cells .	612 61 6
23291854-6	We now demonstrate that protection from double-strand break damage in ER+ cells is mediated via regulation by c-myc , p53 , CBP and SRC1 coactivators in intron 1 of the NBS1 gene .	612 61 6
23291854-5	We previously demonstrated that estradiol protected estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive ( + ) breast cancer cell lines against double-strand breaks and cell death .	
23291854-4	NBS1 polymorphisms have been associated with increased risk of breast cancer .	
23291854-3	NBS1 hypomorphic mutant mice are viable , and cells from these mice are defective in S phase and G2/M checkpoints .	
23291854-2	Human diseases such as Nijmegen breakage syndrome , due to mutations in the NBS1 gene , produce defects in resection of double-strand breaks .	
23291854-1	Impairment of this pathway is associated with cell cycle arrest , cell death , genomic instability and cancer .	
23291854-0	In mammalian cells more than 90% of double-strand breaks are repaired by NHEJ .	
23023398-4	HIF-1α is the key mediator of the cellular response to oxygen deprivation and induces the expression of genes involved in survival and angiogenesis within solid hypoxic tumors .	
23304253-13	Conclusions .	
23304253-12	Furthermore , analysis of the cell cycle using the propidium iodide ( PI ) staining method indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of MM cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis .	91 81 9 8
23304253-11	Using a CFSE proliferation assay , we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited MM cell proliferation .	9
23304253-10	WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of MM cells .	
23304253-14	Our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP on MM cells that enable these compounds to function as effective treatments for MM .	
22438059-8	SP1 overexpression in HMC-1 cells compromised survival compared to SP4 overexpression or control .	
22438059-9	CADM1 downregulation resulted in reduced viability and decreased expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1(L) , but not Blc-2 or Bcl-X(L) , and increased caspase-3/7 activity in both HMC-1 cells and HLMCs .	
22438059-4	In contrast , immature HMC-1 cells expressed only functional SP4 .	
22438059-5	SP4 overexpression in HMC-1 cells and HLMCs augmented homotypic adhesion to a greater extent than SP1 in various conditions .	
22438059-6	In contrast , CADM1 downregulation abolished homotypic adhesion , indicating that CADM1 is the sole receptor mediating mast cell aggregation .	
22438059-7	CADM1-mediated adhesion was enhanced by the presence of cell survival factors .	
22438059-0	Cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CADM1 ) , expressed by human lung mast cells ( HLMCs ) , mediates their adhesion to airway smooth muscle ( ASM ) , and contributes to ASM-dependent HLMC proliferation and survival .	
22438059-1	CADM1 is expressed in alternatively spliced isoforms , but those present in HLMCs and their function are not known .	
22438059-2	We cloned three functional and one cryptic non-functional isoform with alternative splicing between exons 7/11 and 1/2 , respectively , from HLMCs and human MC lines ( HMC-1 and LAD2 ) .	
22438059-3	Differentiated HLMCs and LAD2 cells expressed the functional isoform SP4 containing exons 7/8/11 ( of clones ) , as well as SP1 ( exons 7/8/9/11 ) and a novel SP6 ( exons 7/8/9/10/11 ) .	
24398380-4	Selected analogues and literature-described inhibitors were evaluated for their ability to suppress the glycolytic pathway , as detected by a decrease in lactate production , but none of these compounds demonstrated such suppression at non-cytotoxic concentrations .	31 3
23243586-4	Our results demonstrate that resting Arf(-/-) macrophages express high levels of Ym1 and Fizz-1 , two typical markers of alternatively-activated macrophages ( M2 ) .	
24398380-0	High-throughput screening of a small-molecule library identified a 5-triazolo-2-arylpyridazinone as a novel inhibitor of the important glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/2,6-bisphosphatase 3 ( PFKFB3 ) .	
24398380-1	Such inhibitors are of interest due to PFKFB3's control of the important glycolytic pathway used by cancer cells to generate ATP .	
24398380-2	A series of analogues was synthesized to study structure-activity relationships key to enzyme inhibition .	
23243586-5	Additionally , Arf(-/-) peritoneal macrophages showed an impaired response to lipopolysaccharide ( a classical inducer of M1 polaryzation ) and a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines .	a a2
21541970-0	BACKGROUND Prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression is often associated with transactivation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) by endogenous hormones/growth factors .	
20939432-3	Inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis was correlated with decreasing expression of STAT3 , P-STAT3 , MMP-2 , VEGF , and TGF-beta genes , regulated by STAT3 in MHCCLM6 cells .	1 12 7 71
20939432-2	Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MDA-7 facilitated the MDA-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in HCC cells , but not in the normal liver cell line L02 , and the effect was independent of the p53 status .	511 5 51
20939432-1	In this study , we investigated the effects of overexpression of the MDA-7/IL-24 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells in vitro and in vivo .	
20939432-0	Overexpression of the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 ( MDA-7)/IL-24 in vitro generally results in the growth suppression and induction of apoptosis of diverse human tumor cells .	
20939432-6	MDA-7/IL-24 represents a new class of cancer suppressor genes that may be useful in the targeted therapy of HCC .	
20939432-5	These data suggested that MDA-7/IL-24 induces its selective antitumor properties in HCC cells by promoting apoptosis independent of p53 status , inhibiting subcutaneous tumor growth and metastasis , and increasing the effect of chemotherapeutic agents .	8 12 81 1
20939432-4	We also showed that Ad.mda-7 combined with doxorubicin ( ADM ) had significantly enhanced antitumor and antimetastatic effects in vivo , accompanied by the downregulation of VEGF , MMP-2 , and TGF-beta genes and the upregulation of E-cadherin genes .	11 71 711 1 7 9 92
23243586-0	The ARF locus is frequently inactivated in human cancer .	
1281999-3	The most striking effect was seen in combination with bFGF : when added simultaneously , VEGF and bFGF induced an in vitro angiogenic response which was far greater than additive , and which occurred with greater rapidity than the response to either cytokine alone .	71 7 711
23243586-1	The oncosuppressor ARF has indeed been described as a general sensor for different situation of cellular stress .	
12434285-4	Aflatoxin-albumin adducts were determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus by enzyme immunoassay , as well as genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and T1-1 by polymerase chain reaction .	
12434285-5	The detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts was significantly higher in males ( 42.5% ) than in females ( 21.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=2.6 , 95% confidence interval=1.4-5.0 ) .	61 611 6
12434285-6	The formation of detectable albumin adducts was moderately higher in hepatitis B surface antigen carriers ( 42.8% ) than in non-carriers ( 36.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=1.4 , 95% confidence interval=1.0-2.1 ) .	61 611 6
12434285-7	In addition , the detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts tended to increase with the increasing number of null genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and glutathione S-transferase T1-1 .	61 611 6
12434285-0	Dietary exposure to aflatoxins is one of the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma .	
12434285-1	Individual susceptibility to aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may be modulated by both genetic and environmental factors affecting metabolism .	
12434285-2	A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate determinants of the formation of aflatoxin covalently bound to albumin ( AFB1-albumin adducts ) .	
12434285-3	A total of 474 subjects who were free of liver cancer and cirrhosis and were initially selected as controls for previous case-control studies of aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Taiwan , were employed in this study .	
12530531-5	Our in vitro evidence that sulforaphane is active and even cytotoxic in normal as well as transformed lymphocytes raises important questions regarding its suitability for cancer chemoprevention .	
21541970-5	RESULTS Leptin rapidly induced activation of JAK2 , STAT3 , and MAPK ( ERK1/2 ) signaling cascades ; it may also induce HER2 transactivation via leptin-induced phospho-JAK2 .	921 92 9
12434285-8	In conclusion , this cross-sectional study has assessed the relative contributions of environmental exposure and host susceptibility factors in the formation of AFB1-albumin adducts in a well characterised Chinese adult population .	61 611 6
12434285-9	This study further emphasises the necessity to reduce aflatoxin exposure in people living in an area endemic for chronic hepatitis B virus infection .	
12530531-4	These findings suggest that sulforaphane is a growth modulator for T cells .	
22742931-10	Considering the available data , PPARγ seems to exert beneficial effects against HCC and may therefore represent as a therapeutic target .	
21541970-8	A human leptin mutein LRb antagonist , L39A/D40A/F41A , fully inhibited leptin-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 , ERK1/2 , and Akt/PKB , and partially abrogated effects on apoptotic proteins .	81 8 9 921 92
21541970-9	In LNCaP and PC3/AR cells , leptin increased AR protein levels in correlation with raised apoptotic markers .	8 81
23243586-8	In addition , multiple pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and MMP-9 were also increased .	71 7 711
23243586-9	In summary , these results indicate that ARF contributes to the polarization and functional plasticity of macrophages .	
12607599-0	Angiogenesis is increased in hematologic malignancies , including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) .	
12607599-1	Elevated serum levels of two important angiogenic factors , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , are associated with a poor prognosis .	
12607599-2	Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate 27 patients with NHL and bone marrow involvement ( 17 with low-grade B-cell NHL , including 7 with higher grade transformation ; 6 with intermediate-grade B-cell NHL ; and 4 with T-cell lymphoma ) .	
12607599-3	Among the 17 patients with low-grade B-cell NHL , results for 7 were positive for VEGF stain ( 41.2% ) , and results were negative for all other stains for VEGF receptors , bFGF , and bFGF receptors .	71 7 711
12607599-4	In the 10 patients with intermediate-grade B-cell NHL and T-cell lymphoma , all VEGF staining was positive ( 100% ) , but bFGF staining was only weakly positive in 2 .	71 7 711
12607599-5	Staining results for seven patients who had low-grade B-cell NHL with higher grade transformation showed that VEGF staining was positive in large lymphoid cells of 5 patients and in small lymphoid cells of one patient .	71 7 711
12607599-6	Staining for the receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was positive in large lymphoid cells in four and two cases , respectively .	71 7 711
12607599-7	Staining for bFGF was positive in two cases of large lymphoid cells .	71 7 711
12607599-8	We concluded that VEGF , but not bFGF , was associated with higher tumor grading of NHL and high-grade transformation of low-grade lymphoma .	71 7 711
22593693-6	Tumor recurrence is minor compared with radiotherapy or surgery .	
23251606-4	It has been established that the binding of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate MM cell chemotaxis , adhesion , and proliferation .	
23251606-5	We found that WEV and WEV+NP clearly decreased the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated activation of AKT , ERK , NFκB and Rho-A using western blot analysis ; abrogated the CXCL12-mediated proliferation of MM cells using the CFSE assay ; and induced apoptosis in MM cell as determined by PI/annexin V double staining followed by flow cytometry analysis .	9 81 8
23251606-6	Monitoring the expression of B-cell CCL/Lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) family members and their role in apoptosis induction after treatment with WEV or WEV+NP revealed that the combination of WEV with NP robustly decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic effectors Bcl-2 , Bcl(XL) and Mcl-1 ; conversely increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic effectors Bak , Bax and Bim ; and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential in MM cells .	8 81
22593693-7	This method is a valid alternative to surgery and/or diathermocoagulation for microsurgery of soft tissues .	
23027128-8	Expression of FAK and Palm-PTK6-YF in Fak-/- MEFs synergistically activates AKT and protects cells against anoikis .	
23027128-9	However , expression of Palm-PTK6-YF in Akt1/2-/- MEFs fails to protect cells from anoikis , indicating AKT is critical in PTK6 and FAK-mediated survival signaling .	
23251606-2	The IC(50) values of WEV and WEV+NP that significantly decreased MM cell viability without affecting the viability of normal peripheral mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were determined to be 25 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml , respectively .	
23251606-3	Although both WEV ( 25 ng/ml ) and WEV+NP ( 10 ng/ml ) decreased the CD54 surface expression without affecting the expression of CXCR4 ( CXCL12 receptor ) on MM cells , they significantly reduced the ability of CXC chemokine ligand 12 ( CXCL12 ) to induce actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the subsequent reduction in chemotaxis .	
23027128-4	We identified several potential PTK6 substrates in the human SW620 colon cancer cell line using mass spectrometry , including FAK ( focal adhesion kinase ) .	
1403541-10	The median survival for the overall group was 16 months , whereas that for those undergoing complete resection was 33 months .	
23027128-6	Expression of membrane-targeted active PTK6 ( Palm-PTK6-YF ) induces constitutive activation of FAK and cell morphology changes , which are independent of SRC family kinases in Src-/- , Yes-/- , Fyn-/- ( SYF ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) .	
23027128-7	Palm-PTK6-YF expressing SYF cells are transformed and overcome contact inhibition , form colonies in transformation assays , proliferate in suspension and form tumors in a xenograft model .	5 52
23027128-0	Protein tyrosine kinase 6 ( PTK6 ) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in epithelial cancers .	
23027128-1	Disruption of Ptk6 decreases azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice by preventing signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation .	
23027128-2	Relocalization of PTK6 in prostate cancers contributes to increased growth .	
1403541-11	In patients undergoing resection for cure , grade ( P = .005 ) , regional nodal involvement ( P = .007 ) , and depth of invasion ( P = .03 ) were significant predictors of outcome in univariate analysis .	11 1
1403541-12	In the overall group these variables as well as resectability and distant metastases were significant in univariate analysis .	
23317220-1	Our studies showed that ethyl acetate extract of onion ( EEO ) had potent inhibitory effects on animal fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , and could induce apoptosis in FAS over-expressing human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells .	8 81
23317220-0	Onions ( Allium cepa L. ) are widely used in the food industry for its nutritional and aromatic properties .	
23317220-3	These results suggest that the apoptosis induced by EEO occurs via inhibition of FAS .	8 81
1403541-13	In multivariate analysis high-grade lesions and lymph node involvement were highly correlated , as were resectability and metastases .	1 12
23317220-5	Since obesity is closely related to breast cancer and obese patients are at elevated risk of developing various cancers , these findings suggested that onion might be useful for preventing obesity-related malignancy .	
23317220-4	We also found that EEO could suppress lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes , which was also related to its inhibition of intracellular FAS activity .	
23406762-11	CONCLUSION This report shows that phenylglyoxal is a new DNA-damaging agent with anticancer activity , and suggests that tumor cells with defects in NER , HR and NHEJ may be hypersensitive to the cytotoxic activity of phenylglyoxal .	61 62 6
23406762-10	Mammalian cell lines defective in nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) , homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) were more sensitive to phenylglyoxal than parental cells ; this suggests that phenylglyoxal may induce bulky distortions in the shape of the DNA double helix ( which are repaired by the NER pathway ) and DNA double-strand breaks ( which are repaired by HR and NHEJ ) .	612 62 61 6
20080488-1	RAD51 mRNA expression levels are significantly increased in laser-microdissected mammary simple carcinomas and their lymph node metastases when compared to adenomas or nonneoplastic mammary gland of the same dog .	
20080488-0	RAD51 is a key enzyme of homologous recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks .	
20080488-7	Nevertheless , the increased RAD51 mRNA expression in metastases could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry .	1 12
20080488-6	In conclusion , the increased number of RAD51-expressing cells in carcinomas might indicate genomic instability in these cells .	6
20080488-5	RAD51 expression in carcinomas was correlated with expression in metastases but not with histologic grade .	1 12
20080488-4	In contrast , no significant differences in the number of RAD51-expressing cells were detected when metastases were compared with adenomas and nonneoplastic gland .	1 12
20184723-10	CONCLUSION Gene expression profiling identified specific genes and pathways that are related to neutrophilic inflammation and could be associated to cancer development and indicate an active role of neutrophils in mediating the LPS induced inflammatory response in the mouse lung .	a a2
22438059-12	The most highly expressed SP4 isoform is likely to contribute to MC aggregation and longevity in mastocytosis , and augment the pathophysiology of allergic diseases .	
22906929-10	Emergence of acquired secondary resistance to targeted therapeutics is an important issue that is also relevant to hedgehog inhibition .	
22906929-11	In this context secondary resistance of medulloblastomas to treatment with a smoothened antagonist in two tumor mouse models is examined .	
23271722-5	Intriguingly , the risk of human HCC recurrence is positively correlated with ROS accumulation in liver .	a21 a2 a
22884369-3	The binding of STIP1 to ALK2 activated the SMAD signaling pathway , leading to transcriptional activation of ID3 ( inhibitor of DNA binding 3 ) , promoting cell proliferation .	
22615834-4	Yet , hypermethylation at the former did not result in appreciable silencing effect .	
22615834-5	In contrast , the proximal sequence displayed full promoter activity and methylation of which remarkably silenced RARRES1 transcription .	
22615834-6	This phenomenon was recapitulated in breast cancer cell lines , in which methylation at the proximal region strikingly coincided with downregulation .	
22615834-7	We also discovered that CTCF occupancy was enriched at the unmethylayed promoter bound with transcription-active histone markings .	
22615834-0	BACKGROUND The cis-acting promoter element responsible for epigenetic silencing of retinoic acid receptor responder 1 ( RARRES1 ) by methylation is unclear .	
22615834-1	Likewise , how aberrant methylation interplays effectors and thus affects breast neoplastic features remains largely unknown .	
22436374-8	The effects on growth obtained with siRNA was strikingly different from the effects obtained with TKIs .	
22436374-9	The effects of siRNA probably correlate with the overall oncogenic significance of the receptor , which is only partly inhibited by the TKIs .	
22436374-6	The combined effect of EGFR siRNA and different drugs was evaluated using a combination index .	
22436374-7	RESULTS EGFR-specific siRNA strongly inhibited EGFR protein expression almost equally in all cell lines and inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in all NSCLC cell lines studied , albeit with a different magnitude .	9 93 81 8
22436374-4	The reduction of EGFR mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR .	
22436374-5	The down-regulation of EGFR protein expression was measured by western blot , and the proliferation , viability , caspase3/7 activity , and apoptotic morphology were monitored by spectrophotometry , fluorimetry , and fluorescence microscopy .	
22436374-2	In the current study we have examined , in different NSCLC cell lines , the combined effect of RNA interference targeting the EGFR mRNA , and inactivation of EGFR signaling using different receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) or a monoclonal antibody cetuximab .	
22436374-3	METHODS NSCLC cells ( cell lines HCC827 , H292 , H358 , H1650 , and H1975 ) were transfected with EGFR siRNA and/or treated with the TKIs gefitinib , erlotinib , and afatinib , and/or with the monoclonal antibody cetuximab .	
22436374-0	BACKGROUND The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a validated therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
22436374-1	However , current single agent receptor targeting does not achieve a maximal therapeutic effect , and some mutations confer resistance to current available agents .	
23271722-4	The upregulation of SOX2 and c-Jun was prevented by administration of the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole .	
22595969-6	Evidence for association between DOCK5 transcript levels and the 3975 bp deletion ( P= 0.027 ) and both VNTRs ( P(empirical)= 0.015 ) was also identified in adipose tissue from a Swedish family sample , providing support for a functional effect of the DOCK5 deletion and VNTRs .	
22595969-7	These findings highlight the potential role of DOCK5 in human obesity and illustrate a novel approach for analysis of the contribution of VNTRs to disease susceptibility through association studies .	
22595969-4	We have developed a novel VNTR association method named VNTRtest , suitable for association analysis of multi-allelic loci with binary and quantitative outcomes , and have used this approach to show significant association of the DOCK5 VNTRs with childhood and adult severe obesity ( P(empirical)= 8.9 × 10(-8) and P= 3.1 × 10(-3) , respectively ) which we estimate explains of the phenotypic variance .	
22595969-5	We also identified an independent association between the 3975 base pair ( bp ) deletion and obesity , explaining a further 0.46% of the variance ( P(combined)= 1.6 × 10(-3) ) .	
22595969-2	Here we describe the in-depth investigation of a complex region on chromosome 8p21.2 encompassing the dedicator of cytokinesis 5 ( DOCK5 ) gene .	
22595969-3	The region includes two VNTRs of complex sequence composition which flank a common 3975 bp deletion , all three of which were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and fragment analysis in a total of 2744 subjects .	
22595969-0	Variable number tandem repeats ( VNTRs ) constitute a relatively under-examined class of genomic variants in the context of complex disease because of their sequence complexity and the challenges in assaying them .	
22595969-1	Recent large-scale genome-wide copy number variant mapping and association efforts have highlighted the need for improved methodology for association studies using these complex polymorphisms .	
23201559-1	The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cell line .	
23271722-7	Augmented oxidative stress of liver parenchymal cells may explain the close relationship between liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis .	a21 a2 a
22864932-11	This suggests the putative increase in the risk of local failure in TN patients may be related to increased residual tumor burden .	
22864932-10	CONCLUSION TN subtype has a statistically significant association with an increased risk of residual tumor .	
23065281-8	However , the expression of ZEB1 and E-cadherin was independent of gender , age , tumor size , or tumor differentiation level ( p>0.05 ) .	
12489111-0	Food-derived heterocyclic aromatic amines ( HCAs ) have proved to be carcinogenic in both rodents and nonhuman primates .	
12489111-1	Two different metabolic pathways are suggested for the metabolic activation of HCA .	
12489111-2	The hepatic pathway proceeds via a two-step process involving N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P4501A2 and subsequent O-acetylation by N-acetyltransferase-2 .	
12489111-3	An alternative pathway may be of particular interest in extrahepatic tissues and proceeds via one-electron oxidation catalyzed by prostaglandin H synthase ( PHS ) , rendering free-radical metabolites .	
12489111-4	In this study , we investigated the metabolic activation of two HCAs , 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline ( IQ ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP ) , by two different enzyme systems in vitro , generating different primary and secondary reactive metabolites .	
12489111-5	Rat liver S9 mix and PHS were used as the activating system and represent the hepatic and extrahepatic pathways , respectively .	
12489111-6	Electron-spin resonance spectroscopy showed that both IQ and PhIP exerted inhibiting effects on PHS-mediated formation of hydroxyl radicals during the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins .	
12489111-7	Evidence for the formation of HCA free radicals was presented in an indirect way by the formation of glutathione-derived thiyl radicals , with purified PHS as the activating system .	
12489111-8	Activation by S9 mix did not result in the formation of detectable radical metabolites , showing that the two metabolic routes primarily led to the formation of different metabolites .	
12489111-9	In all electron-spin resonance experiments , IQ appeared to be more effective than PhIP .	
22884369-4	In conclusion , ovarian-cancer-tissue-secreted STIP1 stimulates cancer cell proliferation by binding to ALK2 and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways .	
11980647-5	In parallel experiments , total protein was extracted , immunoprecipitated with cyclin E antibody , and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of cell cycle markers .	
11980647-4	Cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide for flow cytometry analysis .	
11980647-7	However , PC3 cells transfected with the androgen receptor ( PC3-AR2 ) exhibited a G2/M arrest and a marked reduction ( 57% ) in the S phase during cell cycle progression .	91 93 9
11980647-6	Treatment with selenium caused G1 arrest and an 80% reduction in the S phase of LNCaP with no effect on PC3 .	91 9
11980647-1	There has been considerable interest in the chemopreventative properties of selenium .	
11980647-0	Prostate cancer ( PCA ) is the most common histological malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among North American men .	
11980647-3	Human PCA cells ( LNCaP , PC3 , PC3-AR2 , and PC3-M ) were incubated with and without selenium ( Seleno-DL-methionine , 150 microM ) for 24 , 48 , and 72 h .	
11980647-2	In this study , we assessed whether selenium inhibits cell growth and associated cell cycle regulatory proteins .	
11980647-9	These data suggest that selenium possesses strong antiproliferative properties in regard to human PCA .	
11980647-8	In the analysis of cell cycle regulatory molecules , selenium-treated cells demonstrated a significant induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 .	511 5 51
21063097-13	In conclusion , the data suggest that IR-stimulated cation channel activation , Ca(2+) entry and CaMKII activity participate in control of cell cycle progression and survival of irradiated CML cells .	
21063097-12	In addition , KN93 decreased the clonogenic survival of irradiated cells but not of control cells .	
22534171-12	Furthermore , in MDA-MB-231 , mRNA levels of asTF were regulated in a similar way to that of TF in response to the cell treatment .	
22534171-13	CONCLUSIONS This study showed a regulatory mechanism in which MAPK/ERK signals inhibit EGFR/PI3K/Akt-mediated TF expression in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells .	
22534171-10	Most interestingly , the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and EGFR siRNA also significantly suppressed PD98059- or ERK siRNA-induced TF promoter activity and TF protein expression .	9 93
22534171-11	Similar results were found with ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 .	
22534171-16	As the PI3K/Akt pathway and EGFR regulate TF expression in cancer cells , targeting these signaling components is expected to potentially inhibit TF expression-associated tumor progression .	
21152298-11	The LeY antibody shows potential application in the treatment of LeY-positive tumors .	
21152298-10	In conclusion , LeY plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation , tumorigenecity and adhesion , and these effects may be related to increased levels of growth factors .	9 92
1334154-3	PURPOSE This study was designed to determine whether resistance to the activity of nitrosourea ( the drug BCNU ) in BCNU-resistant human medulloblastoma ( D341 Med ) and human glioblastoma multiforme ( D-456 MG ) can be reversed by the methylating agent streptozocin and the O6-substituted guanines O6-methylguanine and O6-benzylguanine .	
1334154-2	Depletion of this protein with alkylguanines or methylating agents , however , restores tumor cell sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of chloroethylnitrosoureas ( e.g. , carmustine [ BCNU] ) .	
1334154-1	Resistance to nitrosoureas and methylating agents , which damage DNA , can be mediated by a DNA repair protein , O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase ( AGAT ) .	
1334154-0	BACKGROUND Although chemotherapy offers promise of increased survival for children with medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme , drug resistance occurs frequently , resulting in tumor progression and death .	
1334154-7	Response was assessed by tumor growth delay and tumor regression .	
1334154-6	Mice were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of O6-benzylguanine or O6-methylguanine ( 240 mg/m2 ) or with streptozocin ( 600 mg/m2 ) daily for 4 days .	
1334154-5	BCNU was administered as a single intraperitoneal injection at doses of 100 mg/m2 , 75 mg/m2 , or 38 mg/m2--i.e. , 1.0 , 0.75 , or 0.38 , respectively , of the dose lethal to 10% of treated animals ( LD10 ) .	
1334154-4	METHODS Xenografts were grown subcutaneously in athymic BALB/c mice .	
1334154-9	RESULTS Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine , O6-methylguanine , or streptozocin reduced AGAT activity to 4% , 25% , and 95% of control values , respectively , in D341 Med and 0% , 0% , and 25% of control values , respectively , in D-456 MG 1 hour after injection .	62 6
1334154-8	AGAT activity in the xenografts was measured at 1 and 6 hours after pretreatment , at the time tumors were excised .	
22692904-5	PC12 cells , the best characterized in vitro pheochromocytoma model , also express Sctr at high level .	
22692904-4	We here report that SR are also highly abundant on the membranes of rat adrenal and extraadrenal pheochromocytoma , starting from early stages of tumor development , and are functional .	
22692904-7	Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Sctr decreases PC12 cells proliferation and increases p27 levels .	511 5 51
22692904-6	Thus , we used them as model to study the role of SR in neoplastic transformation .	
22692904-1	Recently , high SR expression has been observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas , cholangiocellular carcinomas , gastrinomas , and bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors .	
22692904-0	The secretin receptor ( SR ) , a G protein-coupled receptor , mediates the effects of the gastrointestinal hormone secretin on digestion and water homeostasis .	
22692904-3	We recently discovered that pheochromocytomas developing in rats affected by the MENX ( multiple endocrine neoplasia-like ) syndrome express at very high-level Sctr , encoding SR .	
22692904-2	Receptor overexpression associates with enhanced secretin-mediated signaling , but whether this molecule plays an independent role in tumorigenesis is currently unknown .	
22692904-9	Transfection of Sctr in Y1 adrenocortical carcinoma cells , expressing low endogenous levels of Sctr , stimulates cell proliferation also , in part , via the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade .	921 92 9
22692904-8	The proproliferative effect of SR in PC12 cells is mediated , in part , by the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K)/serine-threonine protein kinase ( AKT ) pathway .	921 92 9
22870112-9	In conclusion , the IGF-1 serum level is an important indicator of risk for the most prevalent forms of childhood cancer .	9 92
23271722-3	Its reexpression in p38α-deficient liver prevents ROS accumulation and thioacetamide-induced fibrosis. p38α deficiency increased expression of SOX2 , a marker for cancer stem cells and the liver oncoproteins c-Jun ( Jun ) and Gankyrin ( Psmd10 ) and led to enhanced thioacetamide-induced hepatocarcinogenesis .	
23209410-5	We hypothesized that the inability of the cells to process damage might be due to the differential association of repair components within the RCs and , in turn , potentially preferential repair of the viral genome and compromised repair of the host genome .	
12139732-11	In the transplant group close monitoring of response during reduction in immunosuppression is essential and the early use of B NHL chemotherapy may be effective .	2 22
23272179-10	After AOM and DSS treatment , the mice showed enhanced production of metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 and neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , accompanied by excessive vessel generation and cell proliferation .	7 71
23272179-11	Moreover , CXCL2 promoted neutrophil recruitment and induced neutrophils to express MMP-9 and NE in vitro .	
23272179-12	Furthermore , administration of neutrophil-neutralizing antibodies after the last DSS cycle markedly reduced the number and size of tumors and decreased the expression of CXCR2 , CXCL2 , MMP-9 , and NE .	
14694722-1	METHODS The adduct reactions between styrene , urinary mandalic acid(MA) , phenylglyoxalic acid(PGA) , mercapturic acid of styrene ( UMA ) and DNA were studied by ultraviolet spectral analysis .	
23271722-2	Liver-specific p38α ablation was found to enhance ROS accumulation , which appears to be exerted through the reduced expression of antioxidant protein HSP25 ( Hspb1 ) , a mouse homolog of HSP27 .	a21 a2 a
22882626-1	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) , small , non-coding endogenous RNAs , nucleotides ( nt ) in length , have been well characterized to play essential roles in regulation of the autophagy process in cancer ; however , how these miRNAs regulate autophagic pathways in plant lectin-induced cancer cells , still remains an enigma .	
22882626-0	Plant lectins , carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immune origin , have recently been reported to induce programmed cell death ( including apoptosis and autophagy ) in many types of cancer cells .	
23250485-4	Mechanistically , androgen-mediated autophagy appears to promote cell growth by augmenting intracellular lipid accumulation , an effect previously demonstrated to be necessary for prostate cancer cell growth .	
23250485-5	Further , autophagy and subsequent cell growth is potentiated , in part , by androgen-mediated increases in reactive oxygen species .	a a21 a2 82 8
23250485-2	In this study , we have determined that androgens regulate overall cell metabolism and cell growth , in part , by increasing autophagy in prostate cancer cells .	82 8
23250485-3	Importantly , inhibition of autophagy using either pharmacological or molecular inhibitors significantly abrogated androgen-induced prostate cancer cell growth .	
23250485-0	Androgens regulate both the physiological development of the prostate and the pathology of prostatic diseases .	
23250485-1	However , the mechanisms by which androgens exert their regulatory activities on these processes are poorly understood .	
23137061-10	Arsenic-exposed renal SCs produced more nonadherent spheroid bodies that grew much more aggressively in Matrigel , typical of cancer SCs ( CSCs ) .	
23137061-11	The transformed cells also showed gene overexpression typical of renal SCs/CSCs ( CD24 , Osr1 , Ncam ) and arsenic adaptation such as overexpression of Mt-1 , Mt2 , Sod-1 , and Abcc2 .	
23137061-12	These data suggest that inorganic arsenic induced an acquired cancer phenotype in vitro in these rat kidney SCs potentially forming CSCs and , consistent with data in vivo , indicate that these multipotent SCs may be targets of arsenic during renal carcinogenesis .	
20588232-11	CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate on intensified inflammatory process in women with ovarian cancer ( accompanied by their immunosuppression ) .	a 2 a2 22
20588232-10	The areas under curves constructed for the selected cutoff serum cytokines levels ( AUC-ROC ) showed good predictive values for IL-6 ( 0.87 ) , IL-10 ( 0.836 ) and IL-8 ( 0.797 ) .	a 2 a2 21
20588232-12	Preoperative analysis of serum IL-6 , IL-10 and IL-8 may improve the differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors .	a 2 a2 21
23272129-1	Studies have shown that AA4 , the homolog of CD93 in mice , may mediate cell migration and angiogenesis in endothelial cells .	
21125741-10	Lipid peroxidation level was determined spectrophotometrically as a concentration of final lipid peroxidation products , which in reaction with tiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) form colour complex ( thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances , TBARS ) .	
21125741-11	RESULTS Higher lipid peroxidation level was observed in pre- and postoperative blood sera patients with gastrointestinal tumors in comparison to serum from healthy blood donors .	a21 a2 a
21125741-12	CONCLUSIONS Increased lipid peroxidation level in peripheral blood of patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors is evidence of intensive oxidative stress and might indicate impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms in organism .	a21 a2 a
22867999-2	The intrinsic loss of normal tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due to the necessary metabolic alterations required and the enforced dependence on glycolysis derived energy , mimicking the Warburg effect .	
22867999-5	This represents the first primary renal cell line to model TCA cycle gene loss and provides a perfect partner cell line to our previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line , UOK262 .	
22867999-4	Here , we describe a new immortalized cell line , UOK268 , derived from a patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer .	
22867999-7	The UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein , which localized to the mitochondria , but with loss of almost all catalytic activity .	
22867999-6	We identified a novel germline FH missense mutation , p.His192Asp , and the subsequent loss of heterozygosity in UOK268 .	63 6
22623531-5	For in vivo validation we selected CSNK1e , a kinase whose expression correlated with MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma ( an established MYC-driven cancer ) .	
22623531-4	In addition , genes involved in histone acetylation and transcriptional elongation , such as TRRAP and BRD4 , were identified , indicating that the screen revealed known MYC-associated pathways .	
22623531-7	CSNK1e had previously been implicated in the regulation of developmental pathways and circadian rhythms , whereas our data provide a previously unknown link with oncogenic MYC .	
22623531-6	Using RNAi and available small-molecule inhibitors , we confirmed that inhibition of CSNK1e halted growth of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma xenografts .	
22623531-1	MYC also carries out essential functions in proliferative tissues , suggesting that its inhibition could cause severe side effects .	
22623531-0	MYC oncogene family members are broadly implicated in human cancers , yet are considered " undruggable " as they encode transcription factors .	
22623531-3	Of 49 genes selected for follow-up , 48 were confirmed by independent retesting and approximately one-third selectively induced accumulation of DNA damage , consistent with enrichment in DNA-repair genes by functional annotation .	
22623531-2	We elected to identify synthetic lethal interactions with c-MYC overexpression ( MYC-SL ) in a collection of druggable genes , using high-throughput siRNA screening .	
21739465-9	CONCLUSIONS Our FSP-ARKO mice not only provide the first in vivo evidence in Cre-loxP knockout system for the requirement of stromal fibroblast AR to maintain the normal development of the prostate , but may also suggest the selective knockdown of stromal AR might become a potential therapeutic approach to battle prostate hyperplasia and cancer .	
22623531-8	Furthermore , expression of CSNK1e correlated with c-MYC and its transcriptional signature in other human cancers , indicating potential broad therapeutic implications of targeting CSNK1e function .	
22778940-8	The risk of lymph node metastasis is higher in G ≥ 2 and T ≥ 2 tumours with lymphatic and/or vascular invasion .	1
22778940-9	Other features which have not yet been sufficiently investigated include female gender , TSM stage >1 , presence of tumour budding and/or perineural invasion .	
23272129-0	Human CD93 , an epidermal growth factor ( EGF)-like domain containing transmembrane protein , is predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelium .	
22438059-10	This coincided with decreased basal Kit levels in HLMCs .	
20357518-10	In conclusion , we have developed two glioma cell lines whose distinct mechanisms of acquired resistance to temozolomide , involving expression of MGMT , or inactivation of DNA mismatch repair and recruitment of BER enzymes , are consistent with clinical observations .	62 6
20357518-11	These cell lines provide valuable models for the development of strategies to combat temozolomide resistance .	
23272129-3	However , the role of soluble CD93 in the endothelium remains unclear .	
20661828-8	Taken together , our results show that by modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins and increasing expression of proapoptotic proteins , mixed tocotrienols suppress prostate tumorigenesis in the TRAMP mice .	9 51 91 5 511
20184723-9	The latter possibly refers to a higher rate of cell turnover in the inflamed lung with neutrophils , suggesting that the neutrophil influx is associated with a higher risk for the accumulation and fixation of mutations .	63 6
20661828-2	Male TRAMP mice , 8 wk old , were fed 0.1% , 0.3% , or 1% mixed tocotrienols in AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old .	
20661828-3	Likewise , a positive control group consisting of male TRAMP mice and a negative control group consisting of wild-type nontransgenic mice were fed regular AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old .	
20967519-10	In summary , CZ and LE possess strong inhibitory effects against NF-κB-mediated inflammatory as well as strong activation of the Nrf2-ARE-anti-oxidative stress signaling pathways , which would contribute to their overall health promoting pharmacological effects against diseases including cancer .	a21 a2 a
20661828-1	Herein , we report the efficacy of a mixed-tocotrienol diet against prostate tumorigenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mouse model .	
20661828-6	This decrease in levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions was found to be associated with increased expression of proapoptotic proteins BAD ( Bcl(2) antagonist of cell death ) and cleaved caspase-3 and cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 .	51 5 511 8 81
20661828-7	In contrast , the expression of cyclins A and E were found to be decreased in mixed-tocotrienol groups .	91 9
20661828-4	Our results show that mixed-tocotrienol-fed groups had a lower incidence of tumor formation along with a significant reduction in the average wet weight of genitourinary apparatus .	
20184723-5	Down regulated genes represented nonimmune processes , such as development , metabolism and transport .	
21445621-0	BACKGROUND Hesperidin , a flavanone present in citrus fruits , has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells .	
21445621-1	However , the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood .	
21445621-2	AIM The main purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARγ ) in hesperidin's anticancer actions in human pre-B NALM-6 cells , which expresses wild-type p53 .	
21445621-3	METHODS The effects of hesperidin on cell-cycle distribution , proliferation , and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined in NALM-6 cells in the presence or absence of GW9662 .	
21445621-4	The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARγ ) , p53 , phospho-IκB , Bcl-2 , Bax , and XIAP proteins were focused on using the immunoblotting assay .	
21445621-5	The transcriptional activities of PPARγ and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB ) were analyzed by the transcription factor assay kits .	
21445621-6	The expression of PPARγ and p53 was analyzed using the RT-PCR method .	
21445621-7	RESULTS Hesperidin induced the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARγ and promoted p53 accumulation and downregulated constitutive NF-κB activity in a PPARγ-dependent and PPARγ-independent manner .	9 93
21445621-8	The growth-inhibitory effect of hesperidin was partially reduced when the cells preincubated with PPARγ antagonist prior to the exposure to hesperidin .	
21445621-9	CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that hesperidin-mediated proapoptotic and antiproliferative actions are regulated via both PPARγ-dependent and PPARγ-independent pathways in NALM-6 cells .	8 81
23276719-2	In this study , we used a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ( BAC ) cell line and fibroblasts to assess the expression of Necl-5 in the development of cancer-stroma communication by using an easy-to-prepare double-layered collagen gel hemisphere ( DL- CGH ) system that enables visualization of cell migration during invasion .	
23272129-2	Soluble CD93 has been detected in the plasma of healthy individuals .	
22800968-8	Using the DNA ladder assay , the saponin glycoside ( 12.5 μM ) was not toxic to HUVEC ( human umbilical vein endothelial cells ) or U937 cells , indicating some selectivity between malignant and normal cells .	
23272129-5	We found that rCD93D23 was more potent than rCD93D123 in stimulating the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .	
20932246-1	In this study we investigated the effect of DADS on the induction of apoptosis , as well as its regulatory effect on the activation of transcription factors in B16F-10 melanoma cells .	
20932246-0	Diallyl disulfide ( DADS ) is a major organo-sulfur compound derived from garlic ( Allium sativum ) , which inhibits the proliferation of various types of cancer cells .	
20932246-3	Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the occurrence of the sub-G1 peak was significantly elevated in DADS-treated cells .	
20932246-2	Treatment of B16F-10 cells with nontoxic concentrations of DADS resulted in the presence of apoptotic bodies and induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner .	8 81
20932246-5	The study also reveals that DADS inhibited the activation and nuclear translocation of p65 , p50 , and c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor ( NF)-B and other transcription factors , such as c-fos , activated transcription factor-2 , and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein , in B16F-10 melanoma cells The pro-inflammatory cytokine production and gene expression of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-α , interleukin ( IL)-1β , IL-6 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) were down-regulated in DADS-treated cells compared with control B16F-10 metastatic melanoma cells .	a a2
20932246-4	DADS treatment also down-reguated Bcl-2 expression and up-regulated p53 , caspase-9 , and caspase-3 expression in B16F-10 melanoma cells .	8 81
20932246-6	DADS induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway in B16F-10 melanoma cells by activating p53 and caspase-3 gene expression and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-B-mediated Bcl-2 activation .	a a2 81 8
23272129-4	Recombinant soluble CD93 proteins with EGF-like domains ( rCD93D123 , with domains 1 , 2 , and 3 ; and rCD93D23 , with domains 2 and 3 ) were generated to determine their functions in angiogenesis .	
19935714-0	Inhibition of Notch signaling is effective in inhibiting colon tumorigenesis , but targeting specific components of the pathway may provide more effective strategies .	
19935714-1	Here we show that the expression of Jagged1 , a ligand for canonical Notch signaling , was restricted to enteroendocrine cells or undetectable in the mucosa of the human small and large intestine , respectively .	
19935714-2	In contrast , increased expression characterized half of human colon tumors , although not all tumors with elevated Wnt signaling displayed elevated Jagged1 .	
19935714-3	Increased Jagged1 was also present in intestinal tumors of Apc(1638N/+) and Apc(Min/+) mice , but to a higher level and more frequently in the former , and in 90% of mouse tumors Notch signaling was elevated when Jagged1 was elevated .	
19935714-4	In the human HT29Cl16E colonic carcinoma cell line , induction of goblet cell differentiation by contact inhibition of growth depended on the loss of Jagged1-mediated Notch activation , with signaling through Notch1 and Notch2 acting redundantly .	5 52
19935714-5	Therefore , targeting of Jagged1 could be effective in downregulating Notch signaling in a subset of tumors , but may avoid the limiting gastrointestinal toxicity caused by pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling .	
23272129-7	Further , in a tube formation assay , rCD93D23 induced cell differentiation of HUVECs through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 signaling .	
23272179-13	These observations indicate a crucial role for TANs in the initiation and progression of CAC and suggest that the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis might be useful in reducing the risk of UC-associated colon cancer .	
22695344-6	The c.35delG mutation was most commonly identified and accounts for of the GJB2 mutations found in population studied .	
22695344-7	CONCLUSION Our data also show that there is a gradual decrease in the frequency of the c.35delG mutation and of GJB2-related deafness in general in a cline across Iran extending from the northwest to southeast .	
22695344-4	In all persons carrying zero or one c.35delG allele , exons 1 and 2 were then sequenced .	
22695344-5	RESULTS In total , 374 ( families segregated GJB2-related deafness caused by 45 different mutations and 5 novel variants .	
22695344-2	METHODS A total of 2322 deaf probands presenting the ethnically diverse Iranian population were screened for variants in GJB2 .	
22695344-3	All persons were first screened for the c.35delG mutation , as this variant is the most prevalent GJB2-deafness causing mutation in the Iranian population .	
22695344-0	OBJECTIVE Mutations in GJB2 , encoding connexin 26 ( CX26 ) , are causally related to autosomal recessive form of non-syndromic hearing loss ( NSHL ) at the DFNB1 locus and autosomal dominant NSHL at the DFNA3 locus .	
22695344-1	In this study , we investigated the prevalence of GJB2 mutations in the Iranian deaf population .	
23304253-3	The establishment of more effective treatments that can overcome or circumvent chemoresistance has become a priority .	
23304253-2	Initial chemotherapeutic treatment could be successful ; however , resistance development urges the use of higher toxic doses accompanied by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .	
23304253-1	Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , an almost incurable disease , is the second most common blood cancer .	
23304253-0	Background .	
23304253-7	The impacts of WEV alone and WEV+NP were monitored in MM cells from 70 diagnosed patients .	
23304253-6	Methods .	
23304253-5	In the present study , we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells .

12177246-1	Previous studies have shown that overexpression of Id-1 delays cellular senescence in several cell types , including fibroblasts , mammary epithelial cells , and keratinocytes .	
12177246-0	Id proteins are negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors , which are critical for expression of genes associated with cellular differentiation .	
12177246-3	In this report , a retroviral vector was used to overexpress Id-1 in human endothelial cells .	
12177246-2	Although previous studies have demonstrated the expression of Id-1 in endothelium , the regulation of Id-1 has not been studied in these cells .	
12177246-5	The cells , however , were not immortalized and did eventually undergo senescence despite elevated Id-1 levels .	42 4
12177246-4	Sustained expression of Id-1 resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the total number of population doublings ( replicative capacity ) of the cells compared with vector-treated controls , which correlated with low levels of p16 , p21 , and p27 expression .	
12177246-7	Under these experimental conditions , telomerase activity was not detected and the telomeres became progressively shorter with time .	
12177246-6	Senescence was characterized by a dramatic increase in p16 , but not p21 and p27 .	42 4
12177246-9	These findings may have implications in the development of endothelial cell-derived tumors .	
12177246-8	These results demonstrate the importance of Id-1 in endothelial cell proliferation and indicate that Id-1 represses p16 expression , resulting in delayed senescence .	42 4
22778940-7	Results .	
12373297-1	Using a PCR-based TRAP assay , we investigated telomerase activity in 8 adenomatous polyps , 9 dysplastic polyps , and in 36 paired cancer-normal mucosa specimens , one liver and one spleen metastasis from patients resected for sporadic colorectal cancer .	
12373297-0	Telomerase activity , a cardinal requirement for immortalization , is a crucial step in the development of cancer and has been studied in many kinds of malignant tumours for clinical diagnostic and/or prognostic utilities .	
12373297-3	Dysplastic polyps and adenocarcinoma samples showed telomerase activity , with higher levels in cancer tissues compared to dysplastic lesions .	
12373297-2	Telomerase was absent or very low in normal mucosa and in adenomatous polyps .	
12373297-5	Moreover , telomerase evaluation may help to confirm the malignant transformation in polypoid colorectal lesions with different levels of dysplastic alterations .	
12373297-4	A high telomerase activity was shown to be associated with late-staged cancers and metastasis , providing arguments supporting the role of telomerase not only in the development but also in the progression of colorectal carcinoma .	1 12
23197380-2	Such proteins are able to target several angiogenic factors concurrently , thereby increasing the possibility of therapeutic success .	
12550055-4	The incubation of MCF-7 cells with PUFAs did not alter the cell cycle parameters or induce cell apoptosis .	91 81 9 8

12550055-5	However , the growth inhibitory effects of EPA , DHA and AA were associated with cell differentiation as indicated by positive Oil-Red-O staining of the cells .	
22027089-14	The enhanced sensitivity of PCa cells to ZP and the apparent ability of ZP and TPEN to kill quiescent and rapidly dividing cells in a p53-independent manner suggest that ZP/TPEN might be used to develop adjunct treatments for PCa .	
22027089-13	Overall , the results indicated primarily a necrotic cell death for ZP and an apoptotic cell death for TPEN .	
12550055-6	Lipid droplet accumulation was increased by 65% , 30% and 15% in the presence of DHA , EPA and AA , respectively ; ( p < 0.05 ) .	
22027089-11	Inhibitors of MPTP-opening protected both .	
22027089-10	PKC and ERK-pathway inhibitors , and antioxidants protected against ZP-induced but not TPEN-induced death .	
12550055-7	These observations suggest that fatty acids may influence cellular processes at a molecular level , capable of modulating breast cancer cell growth .	
12550055-0	Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) may influence breast cancer progression and prognosis .	
20924143-10	Serum alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the first month of combination therapy with cetuximab .	
20924143-11	Low retinol and high C-reactive protein concentrations were predictive of poor prognosis in this patient population .	
20890633-4	We report 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazoles as a novel class of orally active microtubule-destabilizing anticancer agents .	
12550055-1	In order to study potential mechanisms of action of fatty acid modulation of tumor growth , we studied , in vitro , the influence of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on proliferation , cell cycle , differentiation and apoptosis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells .	
22427941-10	Activation of ERK1/2 in HaCaT cells and tumorigenic Ha-ras-transformed HaCaT cells resulted in downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression .	
12550055-2	Both eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) inhibited the MCF-7 cell growth by 30% and 54% , respectively , while linoleic acid ( LA ) had no effect and arachidonic acid ( AA ) inhibited the cell growth by 30% ( p < 0.05 ) .	
22427941-11	These results provide evidence , that KGF does not promote progression of cutaneous SCC , but rather suppresses the malignant phenotype of cutaneous SCC cells by regulating the expression of several genes differentially expressed in SCC cells , as compared to normal keratinocytes .	
12550055-3	The addition of vitamin E ( 10uM ) to cancer cells slightly restored cell growth .	
23272129-6	Production of matrix-metalloproteinase 2 increased after the HUVECs were treated with rCD93D23 .	
12579898-4	For mutation detection , a DNA fragment was amplified by PCR at first , followed by a single-stranded DNA preparation .	
12579898-5	In the second step , a short primer was annealed to the position just before the mutation point .

12579898-3	The signal was produced by detecting pyrophosphate released during a dNTP incorporation .	
23266736-5	Additional studies showed that the antiproliferative effect of combination treatment did not initiate apoptosis or result in a decrease in mammary cancer cell viability .	8 81
12579898-8	RESULTS A new instrument was developed for gene mutation detection by pyrosequencing .	63 6
12579898-9	To iteratively inject small amount of each dNTP for the sequencing reaction , capillaries were used to connect dNTP reservoirs and the reaction chamber .	
22443054-3	All mice were decapitated 24h after the injection , free radicals and DNA damage of liver cells were detected by EPR and SCGE .

11836618-9	These observations suggest that tumors positive for cyclin D1 protein may have features of good prognosis but amplification of cyclin D1 gene could be an indicator of tumors with poor prognostic features .	
11836618-8	No relationship was seen with nodal status ( p>0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p>0.05 ) .	
11836618-7	However , overexpression of cyclin D1 was statistically associated with well differentiated tumors ( p<0.05 ) and estrogen receptor positivity ( p<0.05 ) .	91 93 9
11836618-6	A significant relationship was noted between amplification of cyclin D1 and lymph node metastases ( p<0.05 ) but not with histological grade ( p>0.05 ) , estrogen receptor status ( p>0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p>0.05 ) .	91 1 12 9
11836618-5	A significant association was observed between in situ components and adjacent invasive lesions for cyclin D1 expression ( p<0.05 ) and amplification ( p<0.05 ) .	
11836618-4	Our observation showed that cyclin D1 was strongly positive in 61% ( 14/23 ) of the comedo subtype , 61% ( 11/18 ) of the non-comedo subtype , 59% ( 24/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 63% ( 26/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 53% ( 10/19 ) of the non-comedo DCIS and 58% ( 11/19 ) of the adjacent invasive lesions , 58% ( 157/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 73% ( 24/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 52% ( 11/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 27% ( 4/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas .	
11836618-3	Cyclin D1 was amplified in 11% ( 2/19 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas but not in the adjacent non-comedo DCIS lesions .	
11836618-2	Molecular analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was amplified in 30% ( 7/23 ) of the comedo DCIS , 22% ( 9/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 32% ( 13/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 30% ( 82/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 27% ( 9/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 19% ( 4/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 13% ( 2/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas .

23259762-3	The mechanisms by which BMS inhibits HR were examined by microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR .	
23259762-2	The effects of BMS on the repair of IR-induced DSBs by homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) were analyzed by the DR-GFP and EJ5-GFP reporter assays and IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX , 53BP1 , Brca1 and Rad51 foci assays .	
23259762-1	In this study , MCF-7 cells were exposed to IR in vitro and in vivo with or without pretreatment of BMS .	
23259762-0	Our study was to elucidate the mechanisms whereby BMS-345541 ( BMS , a specific I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 inhibitor ) inhibits the repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) and evaluate whether BMS can sensitize MCF-7 breast cancer cells ( MCF-7 cells ) to ionizing radiation ( IR ) in an apoptosis-independent manner .	
23259762-7	Furthermore , BMS treatment sensitized MCF-7 xenograft tumors to radiation therapy in vivo in an association with a significant delay in the repair of IR-induced DSBs .	612 61 6
23259762-6	This resulted in a significant increase in the DNA damage response that sensitizes MCF-7 cells to IR-induced cell death in an apoptosis-independent manner .	61 81 8 6
23259762-5	The results showed that BMS selectively inhibited HR repair of DSBs in MCF-7 cells , most likely by down-regulation of several genes that participate in HR .	612 62 61 6
23259762-4	The effects of BMS on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to IR were determined by MTT and clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in vivo in a xenograft mouse model .	
23229313-4	These findings suggest that PARP suppresses transcription-mediated 53BP1 foci formation , but that this does not occur through the BER pathway .	62 6
23229313-5	In addition , knockdown of CSB , one of the key factors of transcription-coupled repair , slowed the kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation .	
23229313-6	These data suggest that PARP and CSB modulate the formation of 53BP1 foci during the processing of transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks .	612 61 6
23259762-8	These data suggest that BMS is a novel HR inhibitor that has the potential to be used as a radiosensitizer to increase the responsiveness of cancer to radiotherapy .	
23229313-0	Topoisomerase 1 ( Top1)-DNA cleavage complexes induced by camptothecin ( CPT ) cause DNA strand breaks during DNA replication or transcription .	
23229313-1	Although the cellular responses to replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks have been well studied , the responses to transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks have not .	
23229313-2	Here , we show that poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) and cockayne syndrome group B protein ( CSB ) modulate the CPT-induced formation of discrete p53-binding protein 1 ( 53BP1 ) nuclear foci at sites of transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks .	612 61 6
23229313-3	Inhibition of PARP activity enhanced the formation of these foci , while knockdown of essential components of the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway did not .	62 6
23073801-7	The results showed that p120ctn knockdown led to significantly down-regulated E-cadherin and a reduced cell-to-cell adhesion ability in PANC-1 cells. shRNA-mediated knockdown of p120ctn reduced invasion and migration capacity of PANC-1 cells , inhibited cell growth , caused a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in G(1) , an increase in S , and promoted apoptosis of PANC-1 cells .

23073801-2	The recombinant lentivirus vector was constructed to knock down the p120ctn expression of PANC-1 cells .	
23073801-1	PANC-1 cells , a kind of human pancreatic carcinoma cell line , were cultured in this study. p120ctn was immunocytochemically detected in PANC-1 cells .	
23073801-0	This study examined the possible role of p120ctn in the pathogenesis and development of pancreatic cancer .	
23073801-8	It was concluded that p120ctn plays a pivotal role in the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma , suggesting that p120ctn is a novel target for pancreatic carcinoma treatment .	1 12
21541970-10	Thus , AR may mediate , at least partly , the leptin-induced apoptotic response .	8 81
21541970-11	CONCLUSIONS Leptin can clearly induce apoptosis in human PCa cell lines .	8 81

20094029-4	Spontaneous Brc1 foci colocalize with ribosomal DNA repeats , a region prone to fork pausing and genomic instability , whereas DNA damage-induced Brc1 foci colocalize with DSB response factors. gammaH2A binding is critical for Brc1 function .	61 6
20094029-6	From these results , Brc1 docking to gammaH2A emerges as a critical chromatin-specific response to replication-associated DNA damage .	61 6
20094029-1	Phospho-H2A/X ( gammaH2A/X)-binding proteins at double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) have been characterized , but those required for replication stress responses are unknown .

23717113-0	Previously , we reported that Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and gastric cancer are closely associated with increased levels of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) and that Korean red ginseng significantly reduced the severity of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases by attenuating H2S generation .	
23717113-1	Because the incubation of endothelial cells with H2S has been known to enhance their angiogenic activities , we hypothesized that the amelioration of H2S-induced gastric inflammation or angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) might explain the preventive effect of Korean red ginseng on H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis .	
23717113-2	The expression of inflammatory mediators , angiogenic growth factors , and angiogenic activities in the absence or presence of Korean red ginseng extracts ( KRGE ) were evaluated in HUVECs stimulated with the H2S generator sodium hydrogen sulfide ( NaHS ) .	
23717113-3	KRGE efficiently decreased the expression of cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase , enzymes that are essential for H2S synthesis .	
23717113-4	Concomitantly , a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators , including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase , and several angiogenic factors , including interleukin ( IL)-8 , hypoxia inducible factor-1a , vascular endothelial growth factor , IL-6 , and matrix metalloproteinases , was observed ; all of these factors are normally induced after NaHS .	a 7 711 a2 71
23717113-5	An in vitro angiogenesis assay demonstrated that NaHS significantly increased tube formation in endothelial cells , whereas KRGE pretreatment significantly attenuated tube formation .	7 71
23717113-6	NaHS activated p38 and Akt , increasing the expression of angiogenic factors and the proliferation of HUVECs , whereas KRGE effectively abrogated this H2S-activated angiogenesis and the increase in inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial cells .	a 7 711 a2 71
23717113-7	In conclusion , KRGE was able to mitigate H2S-induced angiogenesis , implying that antagonistic action against H2S-induced angiogenesis may be the mechanism underlying the gastric cancer preventive effects of KRGE in H. pylori infection .	7 71
23264896-3	In this work , we studied the effects of a TLR4-interacting surfactant protein A-derived ( SPA4 ) peptide on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced TLR4-NFκB signaling and cancer progression .

22372864-3	The excellent pharmacokinetic profiles of 19a in mice and rats led us to further investigation of a novel therapeutic agent for HER-2-targeting treatment of solid tumors , especially HER-2-positive breast/gastric cancer and HER-2-mutated lung cancer .	9 93
22372864-2	The selected compound ( 19a ) showed excellent inhibitory activity toward HER-1/HER-2 tyrosine kinases with selectivity over 20 other kinases and inhibited the proliferation of both cancer cell types : lapatinib-sensitive cell lines ( SK-Br3 , MDA-MB-175 , and N87 ) and lapatinib-resistant cell lines ( MDA-MB-453 , H1781 , and H1975 ) .	9 93
22372864-1	In contrast to the currently approved HER-2-targeted agent ( lapatinib , 1 ) , our irreversible HER-1/HER-2 inhibitors have the potential to overcome the clinically relevant and mutation-induced drug resistance .	9 93
22372864-0	A novel series of N(4)-(3-chlorophenyl)-5-(oxazol-2-yl)pyrimidine-4,6-diamines were synthesized and evaluated as dual inhibitors of HER-1/HER-2 tyrosine kinases .	
23082126-0	Cancer can be envisioned as a metabolic disease driven by pressure selection and intercellular cooperativeness .	
23142824-8	Taken together , our data suggest that changes in Geminin expression levels affect the establishment of senescence pathways .	42 4
23131583-1	However , the role of a primary translocation in the development of collaborating mutations is debatable .	
23131583-0	Chromosomal translocations typically impair cell differentiation and often require secondary mutations for malignant transformation .	
22800968-6	Several lines of evidence : PARP cleavage , caspase-3 cleavage , DNA ladder assays , and reversal of growth inhibition with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk , suggested stimulation of apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but not in MCF-7 cells , which do not express caspase-3 .	8 81
22800968-7	The haemolytic activity of the saponin glycoside was confirmed in sheep red blood cells , with cell lysis observed at >100 μM , suggesting that , at this concentration , the saponin glycoside caused necrosis through cell lysis in MCF-7 cells .	83 8
22800968-4	The cytotoxic activity of the saponin glycoside was determined in cancer cells using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays .	
22800968-5	After 24h treatment , the observed IC(50) values of the saponin glycoside were 12.5 μM on MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but 100 μM on MCF-7 cells .	
22800968-2	We used a biological activity-guided fractionation approach to isolate the most potent fraction of the crude extract on three cancer cell lines : MCF-7 oestrogen-dependent breast cancer , MDA-MB-468 oestrogen-independent breast cancer , and Caco-2 colon cancer cells .	
22800968-3	A series of chromatographic and spectroscopic procedures were utilised on the EtOAc fraction , which resulted in the isolation of a new steroidal saponin glycoside .

22682706-0	Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder with high degree of genetic influence in its etiology .	
22682706-1	Several recent studies revealed that copy number variations ( CNVs ) of genomic DNA contributed significantly to the genetic architecture of sporadic schizophrenia .	
22682706-2	This study aimed to investigate whether CNVs also contribute to the familial forms of schizophrenia .	
22682706-3	Using array-based comparative genomic hybridization technology , we searched for pathogenic CNV associated with schizophrenia in a sample of 60 index cases from multiplex schizophrenia families .	
22682706-4	We detected three inherited CNVs that were associated with schizophrenia in three families , including a microdeletion of at chromosome 6q12-q13 , a microduplication of at chromosome 18q12.3 , and an interstitial duplication of at chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 .	
22682706-5	Our data indicate that CNVs contribute to the genetic underpinnings of the familial forms of schizophrenia as well as of the sporadic form .	
22682706-6	As 15q11-13 duplication is a well-known recurrent CNV associated with autism in the literature , the detection of the 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication in our schizophrenia patients provides additional support to other studies reporting that schizophrenia is part of the clinical spectrum of 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome .	
22800968-9	We conclude that the steroidal saponin glycoside isolated from F. indica is able to induce apoptosis or necrosis in cancer cells depending on the cell type .	83 81 8
1433375-8	Although no direct NDMA-related cancer was reported in humans , our data point to a potential epigenetic carcinogenicity of nitrosamines due to chronic immunosuppression .	2 22
1433375-6	In conclusion , chronic exposure to the hepatotoxic ( ascite-inducing ) doses of NDMA suppressed humoral and cellular immunity .	2 22
1433375-7	The persistent immunosuppression could be reversed after the removal of NDMA from the drinking water .	2 22
1433375-4	Cellular immune response , monitored by allogeneic stimulation of cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction ( MLR ) , was markedly suppressed by 10 and 20 ppm NDMA .	2 21
1433375-5	Thus , chronic exposure to NDMA , except for the low-hepatotoxic doses of nitrosamine , resulted in a marked and persistent immunosuppression of cellular and humoral responses in CD-1 mice .	2 22
1433375-2	No visible changes in immunological parameters were noted at the 1 ppm NDMA dose .	
1433375-3	Immunosuppression of immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody response by NDMA to sheep red blood cells ( SRBC ) was time-related , dose-related , and could be reversed within 30 d by removal of the chemical from the drinking water .	2 22
1433375-0	Immunosuppression of humoral and cellular responses following chronic oral exposure to 1 , 5 , 10 , and 20 ppm N-nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA ) was examined in CD-1 mice .	
1433375-1	Monitoring of cumulative mortality and the incidence of peritoneal ascites in animals showed an NDMA dose-related mortality and hepatotoxicity .	
22778780-8	Therefore , PLAB may become a potential lead compound for future development of antiglioma therapy .	
21982881-5	Deletion of the sequence 128-550 increased BARD1 turnover at the centrosome , consistent with a role in transient associations .	
22778780-1	It has been reported to exhibit inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in several types of cancer cells .	
22778780-2	However , there is no report elucidating its effect on glioma cells and organ toxicity in vivo .	
22778780-3	In the present study , we found that PLAB inhibited growth of U87 glioblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC(50) Flow cytometry analysis showed that apoptotic cell death mediated by PLAB was accompanied with cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase .	
22778780-4	Using Western blot , we found that PLAB induced G2/M phase arrest by inhibiting tubulin polymerization in U87 cells .	
22778780-5	Apoptotic cell death was only partially inhibited by pancaspase inhibitor , z-VAD-fmk , which suggested that PLAB-induced apoptosis in U87 cells is partially caspase-independent .	
22778780-6	Further mechanistic study demonstrated that PLAB induced caspase-dependent apoptosis via upregulation of p53 , increased level of proapoptotic protein Bax , decreased level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 , release of cytochrome c from mitochondria , activation of caspase-3 and proteolytic cleavage of poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) and caspase-independent apoptosis through apoptosis inducing factor ( AIF ) .	
22778780-7	Furthermore , in vivo toxicity study demonstrated that PLAB did not induce significant structural and biochemical changes in mouse liver and kidneys at a dose of 25 mg/kg .	
22918943-5	Strands incorporate nodes , and in of cells , strands slowly close into rings that constrict without the normal maturation period .	
22918943-4	We found in \u0394mid1 cells that Cdc12p accumulates in cytokinetic nodes scattered in the cortex and produces actin filaments that associate with myosin-II , Rng2p , and Cdc15p to form strands located between the nodes .	
22918943-7	We conclude that orderly assembly of the contractile ring in wild-type cells depends on Mid1p to recruit myosin-II , Rng2p , and Cdc15p to nodes and to place cytokinetic nodes around the cell equator .	
22918943-6	Ring assembly is unreliable and slow without Mid1p because the scattered Cdc12p nodes generate strands spread widely beyond the equator , and growing strands depend on random encounters to merge with other strands into a ring .	
22918943-1	Previous studies concluded that cells without Mid1p lack cytokinetic nodes and assemble rings unreliably from myosin-II strands but left open questions .	
22918943-0	In fission yeast cells cortical nodes containing the protein Blt1p and several kinases appear early in G2 , mature into cytokinetic nodes by adding anillin Mid1p , myosin-II , formin Cdc12p , and other proteins , and condense into a contractile ring by movements that depend on actin and myosin-II .	
22918943-3	Why is ring assembly unreliable without Mid1p ?	
22918943-2	Why do strands form outside the equatorial region ?	
22827697-0	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in cancer cells is considered to be a prerequisite for acquiring invasive/migratory phenotype and subsequent metastasis .	
20862378-5	Our findings indicate that SKI-606 inhibits signaling pathways involved in regulating tumor cell migration and invasion genes via β-catenin alteration , suggesting that Src inhibitor , in comparison to EGF-R , is a promising therapeutic agent for human cervical cancer .	11 1
20862378-4	The molecular pathway analysis of Src/Abl inhibitor revealed that SKI-606 blocks the phosphorylation of β-catenin and consequently converts its role from a transcriptional regulator to a cell-cell adhesion molecule .	
20862378-1	Our results show that SKI-606 and Iressa inhibit cell proliferation and provoke G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest and reduction of S and G(2)-M phase using 2 and 5 μM concentrations of these inhibitors .	9 51 511 5 91
20862378-0	In this study , we compared the effects of SKI-606 with Iressa , Src/Abl and EGF-R kinase inhibitors , respectively , on selected parameters in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines , which express E6/E7 oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types 18 and 16 , respectively .	
20862378-3	These changes are accompanied by a regulation of the expression patterns of E-cadherin and catenins .	
20862378-2	In contrast , SKI-606 induces differentiation to an epithelial phenotype " mesenchymal-epithelial transition " ; thus SKI-606 causes a dramatic decrease in cell motility and invasion abilities of HeLa and SiHa cancer cells , in comparison to untreated cells and Iressa-treated cells in which these parameters are only slightly affected .	11 1
20406967-5	This immunosuppression also led to the incapacity of these mice to reject inoculated TA-positive tumors , in contrast to slow-progressing melanoma-bearing mice , which were responsive .	2 22
20406967-4	Infiltration was associated with local inflammation and systemic Th2/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation that seemed to impair further activation of TLs , as tumor-specific T cells adoptively transferred into mice bearing aggressive melanomas were poorly activated and failed to infiltrate the melanoma .	a1 a
20406967-7	These mice developed aggressive but not slow-progressing melanomas at a higher frequency and with a shorter latency than immunocompetent mice .	
19637241-3	Here we show that hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) arising spontaneously against a background of hepatitis occurred more frequently in Nucling-knockout ( KO ) mice than wild-type ( WT ) mice .	
20406967-1	" Slow progressor " melanomas contained no activated T lymphocytes ( TL ) .	
23151902-0	Meningiomas constitute of primary intracranial tumors and are associated with increased mortality in NF2 patients .	
20406967-3	Aggressive melanomas were also infiltrated by immature myeloid cells ( IMC ) .	
20406967-2	In contrast , " aggressive " melanomas were infiltrated by activated TLs lacking effector molecules and expressing high levels of PD-1 , indicating an exhausted phenotype .	
23304196-5	Based on our in vitro findings , MART-10 could be a promising vitamin D analog for the potential treatment of breast cancer , for example , ER+ patients , to decrease the tumor relapse rate and the side effect on bone caused by antihormone regimens .	
22870112-8	No association was found between IGF-1 and tumor type , stage , metastasis and other disease characteristics .	9 92
23304196-4	Moreover , MART-10 is more active than 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) in causing cell apoptosis , likely through a higher BAX/Bcl expression ratio and the subsequent cytochrome C release from mitochondria to cytosol .	8 81
22719059-8	This work highlights the necessity to characterize additional models of molecular apocrine breast cancer to determine the precise role of AR signaling in this breast cancer subtype .	
22827697-1	This study provides molecular evidence associated with the antimetastatic effect of black tea polyphenol extracts ( BTE ) , which contain polyphenols including gallic acid , gallocatechin , catechin , epigallocatechin-3-gallate , epicatechin-3-gallate , and theaflavin 3,3'-digallate , in an an oral squamous cell culture system by showing a nearly complete inhibition on the invasion ( p < 0.001 ) of SCC-4 cells via reduced activities of MMP-2 ( p < 0.001 ) and u-PA ( p < 0.001 ) .	11 1
23151902-7	In addition , AR-42 decreased Aurora A and B expression .	
23304196-6	Thus , further in vivo animal study is warranted .	
23151902-4	Also , AR-42 increased pro-apoptotic Bim expression and decreased anti-apoptotic BclXL levels .	
21195710-8	Given the ubiquitous expression of α5 laminins in melanoma cells and in melanoma-target tissues/anatomical structures , as well as the strong migration-promoting activity of these laminin isoforms , the α5 laminins emerge as putative primary extracellular matrix mediators of melanoma invasion and metastasis via α3β1 and other integrin receptors .	11 1
21195710-7	In contrast , isolated LMα5 IVa domain-promoted melanoma cell migration was largely mediated via αVβ3 integrin and inhibited by RGD peptides .	11 1
21195710-6	Function-blocking antibodies in cell migration assays revealed α6β1 integrin as the major receptor for laminin-111 , and both α3β1 and α6β1 integrins for laminin-332 and laminin-511 .	11 1
21195710-5	Both placenta and recombinant laminin-511 preparations were highly active , and the isolated recombinant IVa domain of LMα5 also promoted cell migration .	11 1
21195710-4	In functional assays , laminin-111 , laminin-332 , and laminin-511 , but not laminin-211 and laminin-411 , strongly promoted haptotactic cell migration either constitutively or following stimulation with insulin-like growth factors .	9 92
21195710-3	Laminin-332 was not detected .	
21195710-2	Immunohistochemistry of melanoma specimens and immunoprecipitation/western blotting of melanoma cell lines indicated expression of laminin-111/121 , laminin-211 , laminin-411/421 , and laminin-511/521 .	
21195710-1	In the present study we have investigated the production and migration-promoting activity of laminin isoforms in melanoma .	
21195710-0	Melanoma cells express and interact with laminins ( LMs ) and other basement membrane components during invasion and metastasis .	
21465446-11	CONCLUSION Chronic high altitude hypoxia causes both phenotypical and functional changes in pulmonary smooth muscle cells near the air/blood interface .	
21465446-10	Hypoxia-affected cells showed contact inhibition at subconfluence and apoptosis by 48h .	
23304196-3	MART-10 is also much more potent in arresting MCF-7cell cycle progression at G(0)/G(1) phase as compared to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) , possibly mediated by a greater induction of p21 and p27 expression .	9 51 511 5 91
23197380-1	Research focused on proteins that regulate abnormal angiogenesis has attracted intense interest in both academia and industry .	
23304196-2	We demonstrate that MART-10 is 500- to 1000-fold more potent than 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inhibiting cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner .	
23151902-8	To compare the in vivo efficacies of AR-42 and AR-12 , a PDK1 inhibitor , we generated and used luciferase-expressing Ben-Men-1-LucB cells to establish intracranial xenografts that grew over time .	
23082126-2	The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) is a key contributor to glycolysis .	
23151902-9	While AR-12 treatment moderately slowed tumor growth , AR-42 caused regression of Ben-Men-1-LucB tumors .	
23197380-4	In this study we test the hypothesis that AQP1 inhibition impairs tumour growth in a mouse model of melanoma .	
23197380-5	After validating the inhibitor efficacy of two different AQP1 specific siRNAs in cell cultures , RNA interference experiments were performed by intratumoural injections of AQP1 siRNAs in mice .	
23197380-6	After 6 days of treatment , AQP1 siRNA treated tumours showed a 75 % reduction in volume when compared to controls .	
1370093-1	In all primary and precrisis cells , two proteins of 92 and 150 kDa that shared an epitope with p53 were found ; in most of their immortalized derivatives , however , they were absent .	4 41
1370093-0	A panel of primary human cells and virus-transformed derivatives were tested for events that coincide with immortalization .	
1370093-2	Expression of these proteins may be involved in senescence .	42 4
22876840-8	Differences between the results were tested for significance using Student's t-test ( two-tailed ) .	
22213297-5	At 25 mg/kg , naringin inhibited tumor growth by With this treatment , TNF-α and IL-6 levels decreased ( p<0.05 ) in comparison with the control .	
22213297-4	Rats were treated intraperitoneally with different doses of naringin ( 10 , 25 and 35 mg/kg ) , for 50 days .	
22201186-5	Moreover , we provide evidence that activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway is necessary for the GSK3 inhibition-mediated increase in Bim expression and apoptotic response .	8 81
22213297-6	In addition , two rats presented complete tumor regression .	
22213297-1	Patients with cancer generally present features of malnutrition and cachexia .

22213297-2	Levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF-α ) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) are raised in patients with cancer .	
21400522-3	MATERIALS AND RESULTS A total of 101 tissues from the subjects underwent thyroidectomy were enrolled in the study .	
21400522-2	We expect angiogenetic factors are important in the presentation of local-regional neck or distant metastases in PTC .	
21400522-1	This study is to investigate the expression of angiopoietin-1 ( Ang-1 ) , angiopoietin-2 ( Ang-2 ) , Tek/Tie-2 receptor , and vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGF ) in normal , benign thyroid tissues and different stage of PTC .	
21400522-0	AIMS Angiogenesis from thyroid cancer cell plays the important roles in post-surgical persistent , recurrent , and metastatic papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) .	
21400522-7	Of the PTC , significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor were illustrated in recurrent cases .	
21400522-6	Comparing with normal and benign thyroid tissues , thyroid cancer tissues illustrated significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor .	
21400522-5	Ang-1 illustrated highest mean immunostaining score in metastatic group .	
21400522-4	There were 22 control and 79 thyroid cancer patients in different TNM stagings were collected .	
21400522-9	CONCLUSIONS Immunochemical staining illustrated VEGF , Ang-1 , Ang-2 expression in PTC tissues related to clinical staging ; however , we need more information concerning these factors with long-term follow-up results .	71 7 711
21400522-8	VEGF showed statistical difference in disease-free cancer mortality , and recurrent groups .	
21179939-4	Our results suggest that long ( 50 microm ) carbon nanotubes ( 62.5 microg/ml for 4 hours ) produce increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and increased HO-1 gene expression compared with shorter entangled nanotubes .	
22201186-4	We show that prolonged inhibition of GSK3 activity increases Bim messenger RNA and protein expressions .

23144635-1	DNA Polymerase \u03b2 ( Pol \u03b2 ) , encoded by the POLB gene , is the main gap-filling polymerase involved in base excision repair ( BER ) , a pathway that protects the genome from the consequences of oxidative DNA damage .	
22426302-4	Intriguingly , the mutation induced the activation of a cryptic donor splice site in exon 6 and production of an in-frame 30bp deleted transcript ( 8 ± 2% ) .	
20336315-10	CONCLUSIONS Use of RNA interfering ( RNAi ) targeting PKM2 significantly inhibited tumor growth when combined with cisplatin in a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model .	
20336315-11	The enhanced antitumor activity of the combined treatment compared to treatment with shRNA alone may result in part from increased induction of apoptosis and augmented inhibition of cancer cell proliferation .	
23144635-0	Several germline single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) have been identified in the POLB gene , but little is known about their cellular and biochemical impact .	
22027089-7	ZP decreased ATP levels and stimulated ERK , AKT and PKC phosphorylation .	
22027089-6	The morphological/biochemical responses to ZP and TPEN differed .	
22027089-5	ZnSO4 enhanced the toxicity of ZP , but inhibited the effects of TPEN as expected .	
22027089-4	Compared to PCa cells , RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells were less sensitive to ZP and more sensitive to TPEN , but total cellular zinc levels were changed similarly .	
22027089-3	Both compounds induced cell death at micromolar concentrations when incubated with androgen-dependent ( LNCaP ) , androgen-independent ( PC3 , DU145 ) and androgen-sensitive ( C4-2 ) PCa cell-lines .	
22027089-2	Here , we studied the effects of the ionophore Zn-pyrithione ( ZP ) and the chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine ( TPEN ) .	
22027089-1	However , the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells , which differ dramatically from normal cells in their zinc handling ability .	
22027089-0	Zinc dyshomeostasis can induce cell death .	
23144635-2	In this study we tested the hypothesis that expression of the POLB germline coding SNP ( rs3136797 ) in mammalian cells could induce a cancerous phenotype .	
22027089-9	TPEN activated caspase 3/7 and induced PARP-cleavage , DNA-fragmentation , ROS-formation and apoptotic bodies .	8 81
22027089-8	DNA laddering was observed only at low doses of ZP but all doses of TPEN .	
24186204-4	In addition to retrograde signaling markers , there is an induction of mesenchymal genes but loss of epithelial markers in these cells .	
24186204-5	The changes are reversed by either restoring the mtDNA content or knockdown of CnAα mRNA , indicating the causal role of retrograde signaling in EMT .	11 1
22426302-5	Expression of this cDNA variant , lacking 10 residues in the activation domain , resulted in secretion of trace amounts ( 0.2 ± 0.04% ) of protein with appreciable specific activity ( 48 ± 16% of wt-FVII ) .	
12577239-9	This phenomenon occurred in both tumor-bearing as well as nontumor-bearing animals .	
12577239-8	Correlating with the antimetastatic effect measured , exposure of animals to 50 mg/kg of amifostine resulted in a four-fold enhanced serum level of angiostatin above control levels .	
12577239-7	The effects of amifostine exposure on serum levels of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin were also determined using Western analysis .	
12577239-6	A dose of 100 mg/kg was less effective while 200 mg/kg had no effect on metastases formation in this study .	1 12
12577239-5	A significant reduction ( P <.05 ) in the average number of pulmonary metastases was observed only in the group of animals exposed to a dose per fraction of 50 mg/kg .	1 12
12577239-4	The average number of pulmonary metastases per animal was determined for each experimental group .	
12577239-3	Nontumor-bearing control animals were treated using the same dosing and surgery schedules .	
12577239-2	Amifostine was again administered immediately following surgical removal of the tumor-bearing limbs by amputation , and then once more 2 days later .	
12577239-1	Amifostine was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 50 , 100 , or 200 mg/kg every other day for 6 days to C3Hf/Kam mice until tumors reached an average size of 8 mm in diameter .	
12577239-0	The effects of dose per fraction on the ability of amifostine exposure to elevate angiostatin levels in the serum of mice and to inhibit spontaneous metastases formation using the well-characterized murine Sa-NH sarcoma were investigated .	
22426302-6	Altogether these data indicate that the IVS6+1G>T mutation is compatible with the synthesis of functional FVII molecules ( of normal , 1pM ) , which could trigger coagulation .	
24186204-3	Notably , mtDNA reduction generates breast cancer stem cells .	
19655166-8	Inhibition of glycolysis might evolve as a future option for breast cancer therapy .	31 3
12507933-9	DFMO alone did not show significant effects on tumor incidence .	
12507933-8	NDGA alone ( 100 and 200 p.p.m. ) slightly decreased the tumor incidence to 52.4 and 37% , respectively , although the difference was not statistically significant .	
23308053-10	Therefore , this knowledge may be employed to design more comprehensive and effective therapies .	
12507933-1	We established a rat surgical EAC model with esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis ( EGDA ) to mimic the staged process of esophageal adenocarcinogenesis .	
12507933-0	Human esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) develops in a sequence from gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , columnar-lined esophagus ( CLE ) , dysplasia , and eventually to EAC .	
12507933-3	Consistent with this profile , cyclooxygenase 2 ( Cox2 ) was overexpressed in the basal cell layer of esophageal squamous epithelium , CLE cells and EAC tumor cells of the EGDA rats , as compared with the normal esophageal epithelium .	
12507933-2	Profiling of the AA metabolites with mass spectrometry showed that prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , 15-hydroeicosatetraenoic acid ( HETE ) , 12-HETE , 8-HETE and 5-HETE all increased at the esophagoduodenal junction after EGDA as compared with the proximal esophagus , with PGE2 as the major metabolite .	
12507933-5	In a short-term study ( for 4 weeks after surgery ) , dietary administration of both sulindac ( 300 and 600 p.p.m. ) and NDGA ( 100 p.p.m. ) effectively reduced the EGDA-induced inflammation .	a a2
12507933-4	Sulindac ( a Cox inhibitor ) , nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( NDGA , a lipoxygenase inhibitor ) and alpha-difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO , an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor ) were tested for their possible inhibitory actions against the formation of EAC in the rat EGDA model .	
12507933-7	NDGA or 0.5% DFMO , decreased the tumor incidence from 57.7 to 26.9% , or 16.7 or 20% , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) .	
12507933-6	In a long-term chemoprevention study ( for 40 weeks after surgery ) , 300 p.p.m. sulindac , alone or in combination with 100 p.p.m .	
20876804-6	This was coupled with impaired phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 and Src , upregulation of E-cadherin , and suppression of cadherin-11 and N-cadherin .	9 93
20876804-7	These in vitro results were substantiated by reduced MT1-MMP content and in vivo growth of prostate carcinoma cells after the FGFR4-R388 gene silencing .	
20876804-4	Studies with cultured prostate carcinoma cell lines showed that the FGFR4-R388 variant , which has previously been associated with poor cancer prognosis , increased MT1-MMP-dependent collagen invasion .	11 1
20876804-5	In this experimental model , knockdown of FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP by RNA interference blocked tumor cell invasion and growth in collagen .	11 1
20876804-2	Both FGFR4 and MT1-MMP were upregulated in tissue biopsies from several human cancer types including breast adenocarcinomas , where they were partially coexpressed at the tumor/stroma border and tumor invasion front .	
20876804-3	The strongest overall coexpression was found in prostate carcinoma .	
20876804-0	Aberrant expression and polymorphism of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 ( FGFR4 ) has been linked to tumor progression and anticancer drug resistance .	
20876804-1	We describe here a novel mechanism of tumor progression by matrix degradation involving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in response to membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP , MMP-14 ) induction at the edge of tumors expressing the FGFR4-R388 risk variant .	11 1
24139416-1	High-level expression of survivin is involved in both carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in cancer .	
20876804-8	In contrast , knockdown of the alternative FGFR4-G388 allele enhanced MT1-MMP and invasive tumor cell growth in vivo and within three-dimensional collagen .	11 1
20876804-9	These results will help to explain the reported association of the FGFR4-R388 variant with the progression and poor prognosis of certain types of tumors .	
22452442-0	1-Vinylcycloalkenes undergo highly regio- and enantioselective ( >98% ee ) 1,4-hydrovinylation ( HV ) when treated with ethylene ( 1 atm ) at room temperature in the presence of [ (S,S)-2,4-bis-diphenylphosphinopentane ( BDPP)]CoCl(2 ) ( 0.05 equiv ) and methylaluminoxane .	
22452442-1	The minor 1,2-HV products , seen only in 1-vinylcyclohexene ( and 1-vinylcycloheptene ( 2% ) , are formed as racemic mixtures .	
22452442-2	The corresponding Ni(II)-catalyzed HV reactions of these substrates give mostly the 1,2-adducts .	
22452442-3	Racemic 4-tert-butyl-1-vinylcyclohexene , when treated with Co[(S,S)-(BDPP)]Cl(2) and ethylene , undergoes a rare enantiodivergent reaction giving two diastereomers each in >98% ee .	
22799305-4	Univariate analysis revealed that age , tumor size , ALN metastases , LVSI ( lymph-vascular space involvement ) , PCNA status , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy cycles , and HER-2 overexpression , correlated closely with the prognosis .	
22799305-5	ALN metastases , LVSI , PCNA status and chemotherapy cycles were independent predictors of survival .	
22799305-6	CONCLUSIONS HER-2 overexpressed breast cancer has special clinical and pathological characteristics , with advanced clinical stages and high rate of ER/PR double negative .	
22799305-7	Lymph node metastases , LVSI , PCNA and chemotherapy cycles are independent predictors of prognosis .	
22799305-0	OBJECTIVE To study the relationship between clinical pathologic characteristics , treatment modalities and prognostic factors in HER-2 ( Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor-2 ) overexpressed breast carcinoma .	
22799305-1	MATERIALS AND METHODS Major clinico-pathological factors including therapeutic modalities and survival status of 371 breast cancer patients with HER2 over-expression , teated at Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital from March of 2002 to December of 2010 were retrospectively studied , with special attention focused on survival-related factors .	
22799305-2	RESULTS The median age of the total 371 patients in this study was 48 years at time of diagnosis , among which , the leading pathological type was infiltrating ductal carcinoma ( 92.5% ) ; 62.8% presented with a primary tomor larger than 2 cm in diameter at diagnosis , 51.0% had axillary lymph node ( ALN ) metastases ; ER ( Estrogen receptor ) /PR ( Progesterone receptor ) double negative occured in 52.8% of cases , and PCNA ( proliferation cell nuclear antigen ) ( + + + ) was found in 55.1% .	
22799305-3	HER-2 overexpressed patients were usually in advanced stage when the diagnosis was made ( 72.8% at stages IIA The prognosis and survival were assessed in 259 patients with complete follow-up data. 5-year DFS ( disease-free survival ) and OS ( overall survival ) rate was 68.0% and 78.0% respectively .	
21280565-10	In co-treated group , the alveolar septa were thicker than normal with apparent infiltration of inflammatory cells .	a a2
1334154-13	In contrast , treatment with BCNU plus O6-methylguanine or streptozocin did not produce growth delays substantially different from those produced by BCNU alone , reflecting the more efficient depletion of AGAT by O6-benzylguanine .	
21280565-12	Co-treatment with celecoxib restored the normal histoarchitechture in hepatic tissues of CS inhaling mice .	
21280565-13	Thus , the present study demonstrated that celecoxib adminstration reduced the oxidative stress-mediated risk to carcinogenesis , due to its ability to boost the antioxidant defense system .	a21 a2 a
11742853-8	The normal febrile responses of fatty Zucker rats to pyrogenic stimuli at thermoneutrality indicate that fatty mutation does not interrupt febrigenic signaling from the periphery to the brain .	
19655166-4	Expression of pAkt and Her2neu are positively correlated with borderline significance ( P = 0.055 ) .	
1334154-12	Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine increased BCNU sensitivity in both types of xenograft .	
11742853-4	Zucker fa/fa and Fa/ ? rats were infused with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; 10 microg/kg ) through a jugular catheter ( infectious fever ) or with saline through the catheter ( control ) or received a painful intramuscular injection of saline ( stress fever ) .	
11742853-5	At thermoneutrality , the colonic temperature ( T(c) ) responses of fatty rats to all stimuli tested were no different from the responses of lean rats .	
11742853-6	In a cool environment , T(c) responses of fatty rats to all stimuli were degrees C lower than those of lean rats .	
19836430-8	Also , we report for the first time a ROS dependent interaction between pAkt and IQGAP-1 in TNFalpha treated cells .	a21 a2 a
11742853-0	Leptin is thought to be involved in febrigenic signaling from the periphery to the brain .	
1334154-11	Both D341 Med and D-456 MG xenografts were completely resistant to BCNU at its LD10 .	
11742853-2	Studies comparing the fever responses of fatty ( fa/fa ) rats and of their lean ( Fa/Fa and Fa/fa ) counterparts yield contradictory results .	
11742853-3	To resolve these contradictions , we evaluated the effect of fatty mutation on infectious and stress-associated fevers at thermoneutrality ( 29 degrees C ) and in a cool environment ( 20 degrees C ) .	
20817674-8	Treatment of cisplatin-treated mice with luteolin significantly improved renal dysfunction , reducing tubular cell damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis .	a21 a2 a 8 81
1334154-10	After 6 hours , levels changed to 7% , 61% , and 116% of control values in D341 Med and 0% , 79% , and 21% of control values in D-456 MG , respectively .	
24139416-3	We investigated the efficacy of gene therapy with a survivin dominant-negative mutant and possible factors related to lymph node metastasis .	
20817674-9	Examination of molecules involving apoptosis of the kidney revealed that treatment of cisplatin increased the levels of p53 and its phosphorylation , PUMA-α , Bax and caspase-3 activity that were significantly decreased by treatment with luteolin .	8 81
1332809-2	A striking declination in CD8+ cells were found only after R3 operation ; ( 4 ) after a short period ( 10-14 days ) or a long period ( 2-4 years ) of radical gastrectomy , NK cell activity and T-lymphocyte subsets showed no significant differences between R2+ and R3 operation .	
21123967-0	We investigated the priming effect and mechanism of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in chemotherapy with low-dose Ara-C and VP-16 for acute myeloid leukemia .	
23258740-8	Blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic inhibitors enhanced cell death induced by AZD5363 in these PCa cells .	82 8
22778780-0	Pseudolaric acid B ( PLAB ) is one of the major bioactive components of Pseudolarix kaempferi .	
21123967-1	We analyzed cell proliferation , apoptosis , and cell cycle in vitro using leukemia cell lines 32Dcl3 , U937 , HL-60 , and Ba/F3 .	
1334154-15	CONCLUSION We recommend comprehensive clinical toxicologic evaluation of combination therapy with O6-benzylguanine plus BCNU , which would allow subsequent design of phase I clinical trials .	
23258740-0	PURPOSE : Prostate cancer ( PCa ) development is often associated with deletion or silencing of tumor suppressor PTEN , a negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway , leading to resistance to various therapies .	
21123967-6	Concurrent administration of G-CSF further reduced the cell number and viability of 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , but not of HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells .	
23258740-2	However , the efficacy of AKT inhibitors is limited by resistance mechanisms that result in minimal tumor cell death .	
23258740-3	Methods:Effects of Akt inhibitor AZD5363 were investigated on cell proliferation , apoptosis , Akt pathway and survival mechanisms .	
23258740-4	We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy combined with AZD5363 on cell proliferation and apoptosis .	
23258740-5	Furthermore , the anti-cancer activity of combination treatment of the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy ( chloroquine ) with Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts .	
23258740-6	RESULTS : we show that AZD5363 affected Akt downstream pathway by reducing p-mTOR , p-P70S6K and p-S6K .	921 92 9
21123967-7	Apoptotic cells were significantly increased in number by the addition of G-CSF to 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , while G-CSF had no significant effect on HL-60 and Ba/F3 cell lines .	8 81
12069693-7	In contrast , EGF-R was suppressed by 100 nM RA that also suppressed the effect of T. CONCLUSIONS Current results demonstrate interactions between T and RA in the expression of RARs and cell growth in LNCaP cells .	
12069693-6	Furthermore , treatment of LNCaP cells with 20 nM T resulted in an increase in EGF-R .	9 93
12069693-5	Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the presence of putative androgen responsive element ( ARE ) in the promoter region of RAR alpha gene , suggesting that a direct AR-DNA interaction might mediate the effects of T on RAR alpha gene .	
12069693-4	These results suggest a link between RAR signaling and the effect of T on LNCaP cell growth .	
12069693-3	Testosterone treatment of LNCaP cells also resulted in dose dependent , biphasic increases in RAR alpha and gamma mRNAs ; increases paralleled that of 3H-thymidine incorporation and were attenuated by the presence of 100 nM RA .	9 92
12069693-2	RESULTS Both T and RA , when administered alone , stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation in LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner ; the effect of each agent was reciprocally attenuated by the other agent .	
12069693-1	METHOD In this study , we examined the interactions between T and retinoic acid ( RA ) in cell growth of human prostate carcinoma cells , LNCaP , and their relationship with the expression of RAR and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF-R ) .	
12069693-0	BACKGROUND Modulation of the expression of retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) alpha and gamma in adult rat prostate by testosterone ( T ) suggests that RAR signaling events might mediate some of the androgen effects on prostate cells .	
20890633-2	Compound 2 concentration-dependently inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in histocultured human gastric and colorectal tumors .	
12244187-3	Injection of CpG ODN alone or in combination with irradiated tumor cells did not protect mice against subsequent tumor challenge .	
12069693-9	The opposite effects of T and RA on the expression of RAR and EGF-R suggest that signal events of these receptors might be involved in the interaction between T and RA in the control of LNCaP cell growth .	
12069693-8	The presence of putative ARE in the promoter of the RAR alpha gene suggests that AR-DNA interaction might mediate the effects of T on RAR alpha gene .	
20204879-5	Applications of the assay for quantitative detection of 3'OH , 3'P , or DNA strand breaks at a cleavage site of the deoxyribose residue are discussed .	612 61 6
20817674-0	BACKGROUND Cisplatin chemotherapy often causes acute kidney injury in cancer patients .	
20204879-1	DSBs are also formed transiently during such processes as replication , transcription , and DNA repair .	
20204879-0	DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) arise from spontaneous DNA damage due to metabolic activities or from direct and indirect damaging effects of stress .	
20204879-3	Thus , measurement of strand breaks can provide an informative picture of genome stability of a given cell .	612 61 6
20817674-1	The causative mechanisms of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury include renal inflammation , activation of p53 tumour suppressor protein and tubular apoptosis .	
20890633-1	Disruption of the microtubule structure in cancer cells by compound 2 was also observed .	
20693267-4	There were no associations of any nutrient or supplement with prostate cancer risk overall .	
12505306-1	An element in the region responsible for premature termination of transcription mediates a rapid repression of c-myc gene expression by T3 .	
12505306-0	The thyroid hormone ( T3 ) blocks proliferation and induces differentiation of neuroblastoma N2a-beta cells that overexpress the beta 1 isoform of the T3 receptor .	
12505306-3	In addition , a strong and sustained increase of the levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor ( CKI ) p27(Kip1) are found in T3-treated cells .	511 5 51
12505306-2	The hormone also causes a decrease of cyclin D1 gene transcription , and is able to antagonize the activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by Ras .	91 9
12505306-5	As a consequence of these changes , retinoblastoma proteins are hypophosphorylated in T3-treated N2a-beta cells , and progression through the restriction point in the cell cycle is blocked .	511 5 51
12505306-4	The increased levels of p27(Kip1) lead to a marked inhibition of the kinase activity of the cyclin-CDK2 complexes .	511 5 51
22495714-9	However , we observed that the expression level of the A3 receptor in tumor tissues was 1.27-fold that of normal tissues , whereas there was no significant difference between the expression levels of A1 in normal and tumor tissues .	9 93
22495714-8	RESULTS All breast tumor and normal tissue specimens expressed A1 and A3 adenosine receptor transcripts .	9 93
22495714-7	The intensity of the bands was quantitated with ImageJ software after normalization against beta-actin expression .	
12244187-8	Mice that rejected a tumor upon peritumoral CpG treatment remained tumor free and were protected against rechallenge with the same tumor cells , but not with the other tumor , demonstrating long term memory .	
22495714-5	Amplification of beta-actin mRNA served as control for RT-PCR .	
22495714-4	Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA , and PCR was performed under optimized condition for each receptor subtype .	
22495714-3	METHODS Breast tumors ( n = 18 ) and non-neoplastic mammary tissues ( n = 10 ) were collected and histologically confirmed to be neoplastic or non-neoplastic , respectively .	
22495714-2	In the present study , we used semiquantitative RT-PCR to measure the A1 and A3 gene expression levels in normal and tumor breast tissues .	
22495714-1	We recently showed the expression profile of A2A and A2B receptors in normal and tumor breast tissues .	
12244187-9	Tumor-specific CD8 T cells as well as innate effector cells contributed to the antitumor activity of treatment .	2 21
11821958-0	Oncostatin M ( OSM ) , an interleukin-6 type cytokine , acts via the gp130 signaling receptor to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of breast cancer cells .	
11821958-1	EGF , a mitogen for breast cells , signals via EGFR/ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors which are implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis .	
11821958-2	Here we show paradoxically that EGF enhanced the OSM-induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of cellular differentiation in both estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancer cells .	9 93 92
11821958-3	This functional synergism was also seen with heregulin but not SCF , PDGF or IGF-1 , indicating that it was specific to EGF-related growth factors .	9 92
11821958-4	Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that gp130 was constitutively associated with ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 .	
11821958-5	There was a similar association between the OSMRbeta and ErbB-2 .	
11821958-6	Furthermore , EGF unexpectedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 .	
11821958-7	We show that OSM induced phosphorylation of STAT3 .	
11821958-8	Both OSM and EGF activated the p42/44 MAP kinases , but while the MEK inhibitor , PD98059 , ablated the OSM-induced inhibition , it only partially ablated the inhibitory effects of OSM plus EGF .	
11821958-9	Thus , we have demonstrated that the receptors and signalling pathways of two apparently unrelated growth factors were intimately linked , resulting in an unexpected biological effect .	9 93 92
11964309-6	Notch1 signaling may therefore be activated in tumor cells by Jagged1 through homotypic or heterotypic cell-cell interactions , and it seems likely that these interactions contribute to lymphomagenesis in vivo .	
11964309-7	Thus , our data suggest that activated Notch1 signaling plays an important role in the pathobiology of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and that it might be a potential new target for treatment .	
11964309-0	Notch signaling controls cell fate decisions of hematopoietic progenitors by inhibiting certain steps of differentiation and inducing either self-renewal or differentiation toward lymphoid or myeloid lineages .	
11964309-1	In addition , truncated Notch1 alleles could be associated with 10% of all cases of human T lymphoblastic leukemia and , when introduced into mouse bone marrow stem cells , cause T-cell neoplasms .	
11964309-2	However , functional links between the abundant expression of intact Notch1 and oncogenesis are still lacking .	
11964309-3	Here we show that Notch1 is highly expressed in B- and T-cell-derived tumor cells of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma .	
20460749-7	We believe that targeting of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human HCC cells could provide new sight into the treatment of HCC .	
20460749-6	Ouabain could induce HepG2 cell apoptosis and generate S phase arrest , and siRNA could enhance the anti-cancer effect of ouabain that induced HepG2 cells apoptosis via an intracellular Ca(2+) and ROS increase-mediated , and generated cell cycle S phase arresting by decreasing the CyclinA1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2)/proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) complex product and increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( P21(CIP1) ) .	9 51 511 5 91 8 81
20460749-5	Ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 siRNA could inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation .	
20460749-4	Our data showed that the expression Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in HCC tissues is higher than that in normal liver tissues .	
20460749-3	Using the ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit siRNA , which target the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase , we have evaluated the effects of inhibiting Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 in human HepG2 cells with respect to cell proliferation , morphology , cell cycle , impact on intracellular Ca2++ , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) concentration , and correlated gene expression level on messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and protein .	
20460749-2	The expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , normal liver tissues and human HCC line ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 ) has been investigated .	
20460749-1	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 small interfering ribonucleic acid ( siRNA ) on HepG2 cell proliferation , apoptosis and cell cycle , and to explore the molecular mechanisms .	
20460749-0	Recent research has shown that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit is a novel anti-cancer target , which plays pivotal roles in malignant cell ion transport , metabolism , migration and signal transduction .	
22267489-1	Chromatin architecture and dynamics dictates the timing of cellular events by regulating proteins ' accessibility to DNA as well as by acting as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions .	
22267489-0	Chromatin , a complex of DNA and proteins in the eukaryotic cell nucleus governs various cellular processes including DNA replication , DNA repair and transcription .	
22267489-3	Chromatin changes brought about by histone modifications , histone-modifying enzymes , chromatin remodeling factors , histone chaperones , histone variants and chromatin dynamics influence the regulation and timing of gene expression .	
22267489-2	Nucleosome , the basic unit of chromatin consists of a histone octamer comprised of ( H3-H4)2 tetramer and two H2A-H2B dimers on which 146 bp of DNA is wrapped around times .	
22267489-5	Further , during the process of DNA replication , not only does an organism's DNA have to be accurately replicated but also the chromatin structure and the epigenetic marks have to be faithfully transmitted to the daughter cells .	
22267489-4	Similarly , the timing of DNA replication is dependent on the chromatin context that in turn dictates origin selection .	
22267489-7	In this review , we focus on how chromatin modulates two fundamental processes , DNA replication and transcription .	
22267489-6	Active transcription has been shown to repress replication while at the same time it has been shown that when origins are located at promoters , because of enhanced chromatin accessibility , they fire efficiently .	
23270926-4	Bioinformatic analysis showed that mTOR gene was a direct target of miR-100. siRNA-mediated mTOR knockdown phenocopied the effect of miR-100 in BC cell lines .	
23270926-5	In addition , the cancerous metastatic nude mouse model established on the basis of primary BC cell lines suggested that miR-100/mTOR regulated cell motility and was associated with tumor metastasis .	1 12
23270926-6	Both mTOR and p70S6K ( downstream messenger ) presented higher expression levels in distant metastatic foci such as in liver and kidney metastases than in primary tumor .	1 12
23270926-7	Taken together , miR-100 may act as a tumor suppressor in BC , and reintroduction of this mature miRNA into tumor tissue may prove to be a therapeutic strategy by reducing the expression of target genes .	
23270926-0	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are involved in cancer development and progression , acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes .	
23270926-1	In this study , miRNA profiling was performed on 10 paired bladder cancer ( BC ) tissues using 20 GeneChipTM miRNA Array , and 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in BC and adjacent noncancerous tissues of any disease stage/grade .	
23270926-2	After validated on expanded cohort of 67 paired BC tissues and 10 human BC cell lines by qRT-PCR , it was found that miR-100 was down-regulated most significantly in cancer tissues .	
23270926-3	Ectopic restoration of miR-100 expression in BC cells suppressed cell proliferation and motility , induced cell-cycle arrest in vitro , and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo both in subcutaneous and intravesical passage .	9 51 511 5 91
23222813-1	CTHRC1 has recently been shown to be expressed in human cancers such as breast cancer and melanoma .	
22867999-3	Thus , there is considerable utility in establishing a preclinical cell model from these tumors to study energy metabolism deregulation , as well as developing new targeted therapeutic approaches for TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers .	
24186204-0	Metastatic breast tumors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which renders them resistant to therapies targeted to the primary cancers .	
24139416-6	Eight days after the last dose , five randomly chosen mice from each group were sacrificed .	
23209436-8	This finding was in accord with in vivo studies , as Fhit knockout mouse tissue showed no evidence of cell cycle arrest or senescence yet exhibited numerous somatic DNA copy number aberrations at replication stress-sensitive loci .	91 9 42 4
23209436-9	Furthermore , cells established from Fhit knockout tissue showed rapid immortalization and selection of DNA deletions and amplifications , including amplification of the Mdm2 gene , suggesting that Fhit loss-induced genome instability facilitates transformation .	
23209436-2	A frequent , perhaps earliest , genetic alteration in preneoplasias is deletion within the fragile FRA3B/FHIT locus , leading to loss of Fhit protein expression .	
23209436-3	Because common chromosome fragile sites are exquisitely sensitive to replication stress , it has been proposed that their clonal alterations in cancer cells are due to stress sensitivity rather than to a selective advantage imparted by loss of expression of fragile gene products .	
23209436-0	Genomic instability drives tumorigenesis , but how it is initiated in sporadic neoplasias is unknown .	
23209436-1	In early preneoplasias , alterations at chromosome fragile sites arise due to DNA replication stress .	
19744772-2	While proliferation of PTEN-positive cells was insensitive to increases in glucose concentration beyond 2.5mM , PTEN-null cells significantly increased proliferation with increasing glucose concentration across the normal physiologic range to approximately 10mM , coinciding with a shift to glycolysis and " glucose addiction " .	31 3
19744772-3	This demonstrates that the impact of loss of function of PTEN is modified by glucose concentration , and may be relevant to epidemiologic results linking hyperglycemia to cancer risk and cancer mortality .	31 3
19744772-0	PTEN loss of function enhances proliferation , but effects on cellular energy metabolism are less well characterized .	
19744772-1	We used an inducible PTEN expression vector in a PTEN-null glioma cell line to examine this issue .	
22848707-6	CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that activation of the aerobic glycolytic pathway , corresponding to the Warburg effect , occurs in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells , in contrast to mitogen-activated B-cells .	31 3
20406967-9	Therefore , tumor-intrinsic factors distinguishing the two melanoma types control the initiation of inflammation , which was independent of adaptive immunity .	a1 a
24139416-9	Administration of mSurvivinT34A plasmid complexed with cationic liposome ( DOTAP/chol ) resulted in the efficacious inhibition of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis within the mouse H22 tumor model .	1 12
20406967-8	Immunodeficient mice also developed abnormal inflammation and infiltration of IMCs in a manner similar to immunocompetent mice , indicating that this phenotype was not dependent on adaptive immunity .	a1 a
21125741-8	Blood was taken from patients 1 day before and 6 days after surgery .	
21125741-9	Control blood was obtained from 53 healthy blood donors .	
21125741-2	Final lipid peroxidation products ( saturated and unsaturated aldehydes ) are highly reactive and characterized by greatly longer half life time than reactive oxygen species and capability to diffuse from places of their formation to distant cell areas .	
21125741-3	In cells they react with important biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins causing their structural and functional damages .	
21125741-0	INTRODUCTION Clinical and experimental studies indicate oxygen free radicals and their reactive derivatives participation in formation of chronic inflammation states , which facilitate gastrointestinal tract tumors development .	
21125741-1	During malignant changes formation in epithelium of gastrointestinal tract increased oxygen radicals generation initiates lipid peroxidation and DNA and proteins oxidation processes .	
21125741-6	STUDY AIM Determination of lipid peroxidation level in blood serum patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors .	
21125741-7	MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials for studies were obtained from 170 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors : 10 with stomach cancer , 20 with pancreatic cancer , 30 with primary liver cancer , 60 with primary colorectal cancer and 50 with metachronic colorectal cancer liver metastases .	
21125741-4	The effects of changes in cell membranes structure are increase in their permeability , depolarization , decrease of hydrophobicity and inhibition of enzymes , membrane channels and transporters .	
21125741-5	These changes lead to the loss of cell integrity .	
24139416-8	After the remaining animals were sacrificed , we compared the tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes in each group .	
23111389-2	Co-culture experiments indicated that the MT-1 cells displayed a high activity of adhesion with endothelial cells and could form larger and more tube-like structures with endothelial cells .	
23197380-0	Prohibiting angiogenesis is an important therapeutic approach for fighting cancer and other angiogenic related diseases .	
23131583-2	To delineate the role of leukemic translocation NUP98-HOXD13 ( NHD13 ) in secondary mutagenesis , DNA break and repair mechanisms in stimulated mouse B lymphocytes expressing NHD13 were analyzed .	
20406967-6	To test the role of adaptive immunity in tumor progression , we induced melanomas in immunodeficient RagKO compound mice .	a1 a
1460673-1	We have recently shown that antagonists of bombesin and gastrin-releasing peptide , including RC-3095 , inhibit the growth of pancreatic , colonic , and prostatic cancers in experimental animals .	
1460673-0	Many breast cancers are estrogen independent , and even in patients who initially respond to estrogen suppression therapy , the regression is often temporary .	
1460673-2	This effect was associated with a substantial decrease in epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor levels in pancreatic and colon cancers .	9 93
20351312-2	Here , we demonstrate that , in mouse DCs , TLR agonists stimulate a profound metabolic transition to aerobic glycolysis , similar to the Warburg metabolism displayed by cancer cells .	31 3
20351312-3	This metabolic switch depends on the phosphatidyl inositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway , is antagonized by the adenosine monophosphate ( AMP)-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , and is required for DC maturation .	
20351312-0	Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are key regulators of innate and acquired immunity .	
20351312-1	The maturation of DCs is directed by signal transduction events downstream of toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and other pattern recognition receptors .	
20354187-5	On the other hand , JNK , along with phosphoinositide 3-kinase , is essential for Ras-induced glycolysis , an energy-producing process known to benefit cancer growth .	31 3
20354187-4	JNK2 prevents Ras-induced cell senescence and growth arrest by reducing the expression levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p16 and the activation of NF-kappaB .	42 4
20351312-4	The metabolic switch induced by DC activation is antagonized by the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 .	a a2
20351312-5	Our data pinpoint TLR-mediated metabolic conversion as essential for DC maturation and function and reveal it as a potential target for intervention in the control of excessive inflammation and inappropriately regulated immune responses .	a1 a
20519814-5	In conclusion , clinicians should bear in mind not only the published adverse effects , but also massive tumor lysis , when treating patients with large tumor burden by sorafenib .	
20519814-4	An abdominal CT showed multiple low density areas and tumor markers decreased , indicating extended tumor necrosis .	83 8
20519814-1	The patient's tumors had slowly enlarged despite several treatments .	
20519814-0	A 33-year-old man presented with pain and palsy of the leg in 2008 for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with huge distant metastases .	
20519814-3	Laboratory investigations on day 7 showed massive tumor lysis .	
20519814-2	Oral administration of sorafenib at 800 mg/day with careful observation was commenced in 2009 .	
22763381-5	Overall , 188 participants ( 154 carriers and 34 noncarriers ) from 115 families were included : Ashkenazi , Iraq , Kuchin-Indians , Syria , Turkey , Iran , Tunisia , Bulgaria , non-Jewish English , non-Jewish Malaysian , and Hispanics .	
22763381-4	Estimation of mutation age was based on a subset of 11 markers spanning a region of using a previously developed algorithm applying the maximum likelihood method .	
22763381-7	In Ashkenazim , it is a founder mutation that arose 61 generations ago , and with a small group of founder mutations was introduced into the Hispanic population ( conversos ) years ago , and into the Iraqi-Jewish community years ago .	
22763381-6	Haplotype analysis indicated that the 185delAG mutation arose 750-1500 years ago .	
22763381-1	Previous studies estimated that this is a founder mutation in Jewish mutation carriers that arose before the dispersion of Jews in the Diaspora years ago .	
22763381-0	The 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation is encountered primarily in Jewish Ashkenazi and Iraqi individuals , and sporadically in non-Jews .	
22763381-3	Ethnically diverse Jewish and non-Jewish 185delAG*BRCA1 mutation carriers and their relatives were genotyped using 15 microsatellite markers and three SNPs spanning 12.5\u2009MB , encompassing the BRCA1 gene locus .	
22763381-2	The aim of this study was to assess the haplotype in ethnically diverse 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation carriers , and to estimate the age at which the mutation arose .	
1328987-2	Two mutant viruses were constructed to encode altered large T proteins that fail to bind the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene product pRB , along with normal small and middle T proteins .	
1328987-3	The pRB-binding mutants proved to be defective in immortalization of primary rat embryo fibroblasts by a variety of tests .	4 41
1328987-0	The mouse polyomavirus encodes a tumor-suppressor gene inactivator in its large T protein and a proto-oncogene activator in its middle T protein .	
1328987-1	We have used site-directed mutagenesis to selectively inactivate the former function without affecting the latter .	
1328987-6	We conclude that induction of multiple tumor types in this system does not depend on large T-pRB interactions but rather on middle T-dependent pathways .	
1328987-7	In addition , the ability of this virus to immortalize cells in culture is not essential to its ability to induce tumors in the animal .	4 41
1328987-4	Yet they proved capable of transforming both primary and established fibroblasts in culture .	
1328987-5	Most importantly , the inability of these mutants to bind pRB had little effect on their ability to induce tumors in mice .	
12865631-3	The hyperplastic mucosa also showed hypoacetylation of histone H4 and reduction of both p53 and von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) proteins .	
12865631-2	In the hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to KM12SM tumor in the cecum of athymic mice , VEGF upregulation was associated with hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1alpha induction .	71 7 711
12865631-1	We investigated the role of histone acetylation in vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to orthotopic colon cancer in mice .	
12865631-0	Expression of angiogenic factors is upregulated in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to colon cancer , and this upregulation is closely associated with cancer growth and metastasis .	
12865631-7	The subsequent suppression of protein ubiquitination leads to upregulation of VEGF production by HIF-1alpha retention .	
12865631-6	These findings suggest that EGF- or IL-15-induced histone H4 hypoacetylation is associated with repression of p53 and VHL genes in intestinal epithelial cells .	
12865631-5	Acetylated histone H4 , p53 protein and ubiquitinated protein levels were reduced , whereas HIF-1alpha production was upregulated in EGF- and IL-15-treated IEC6 cells .	
12865631-4	To examine the effects of growth factors and cytokines on histone acetylation and levels of p53 , VHL and HIF-1alpha , the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC6 was treated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and interleukin ( IL)-15 for 35 days .	9 92
20588232-5	METHODS The levels of cytokines were measured using ELISA sets .	
12446587-8	These findings also emphasize the potential role of pathways other than the AR axis in acquisition of androgen independence .	
20588232-4	POPULATION 51 women with epithelial ovarian cancer , 26 with benign ovarian tumors of epithelial origin and 21 healthy controls .	
12446587-4	LNCaP/sHB tumors also expressed higher levels of the neuroendocrine marker , neuron-specific enolase , compared with control tumors .	
12446587-5	In castrates , increased neuron-specific enolase expression in LNCaP/sHB tumors was associated with reduced androgen receptor ( AR ) levels .	9 93
12446587-6	In vitro , AR protein levels were reduced in LNCaP/sHB cells , and in transient transfection assays using an androgen-responsive promoter ( mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat ) , LNCaP/sHB cells showed reduced sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone compared with controls .	9 93 92
12446587-7	This is the first demonstration that continuous exposure of AR-positive PCa cells to a single growth factor can promote an androgen-independent phenotype in vivo .	9 92
12446587-0	Peptide growth factors have been implicated in progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) to the androgen-independent state ; however , much of the evidence linking diffusible mitogens and survival factors to this process remains circumstantial .	
12446587-1	Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) , a prostate stroma-derived factor , promotes survival , proliferation , and neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-dependent LNCaP PCa cells in vitro .	
12446587-2	To test whether sustained exposure to HB-EGF can confer an androgen-independent phenotype , we generated stable populations of LNCaP cells that express constitutively a secreted form of HB-EGF ( LNCaP/sHB ) .	
12446587-3	LNCaP/sHB cells proliferated more rapidly under androgen-depleted conditions in vitro and formed larger tumors with higher frequency in intact and castrated severe combined immunodeficient mice , in comparison to control cells .	9
21063097-9	Similarly , IR stimulated a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation conductance in primary CML cells within 2-4 h p.i. .	
21063097-8	In K562 cells , G(2)/M cell cycle arrest was preceded by activation of TRPV5/6-like nonselective cation channels in the plasma membrane 1-5 h p.i. , resulting in an elevated Ca(2+) entry as evident from fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging .	511 5 51
20588232-6	RESULTS We did not found differences in the levels of IFN-gamma , TNF-alpha and IL-2 in all fluids isolated from patients with malignant or benign tumors .	a 2 a2 21
21063097-1	Here , we defined the role of Ca(2+) signaling in the cell cycle control and survival of chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells subjected to ionizing radiation ( IR ) .	
20588232-1	We also estimated serum cytokines as biomarkers to distinguish preoperatively between malignant or benign character of tumors .	
21063097-3	Tumor survival was analyzed by clonogenic survival assay and cell cycle progression via flow cytometry .	
21063097-2	To this end , K562 erythroid leukemia cells were irradiated ( 0-10 Gy ) .	
21063097-5	Nuclear activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II ( CaMKII ) was defined by Western blotting .	
21063097-4	Plasma membrane cation conductance was assessed by patch-clamp whole-cell recording and the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ( [ Ca(2+)](i) ) was measured by fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging .	
21063097-7	The results indicated that IR ( 10 Gy ) induced a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest of K562 cells within 24 h post-irradiation ( p.i. ) and decreased the clonogenic survival to 0.5 % of that of the control cells .	511 5 51
20588232-0	OBJECTIVE To analyze the profiles of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) in serum and the tumor microenvironment ( cyst fluid , ascites ) in women with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors to find the differences in their immunological status .	
20854069-5	CONCLUSION We conclude that p16 cytoplasmic expression can be used as a predictor of outcome in conservatively treated prostate cancer .	
20854069-4	There was a significant association between p16 cytoplasmic expression and prostate cancer survival ( HR = 2.52 , 95%CI = 1.79-3.55 , p < 0.001 ) and overall survival ( HR = 1.54 , 95% CI = 1.20-1.98 , p = 0.001 ) in a univariate model. p16 expression remained an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer survival ( HR = 1.50 , 95%CI = 1.05-2.14 , p = 0.03 ) .	511 5 51
23276719-4	This tendency didn't change even when the BAC cells were mixed with fibroblasts .	
20854069-6	Rb and p21 show no independent association with outcome and therefore further research is not warranted .	
20854069-1	We investigated the hypothesis that the tissue expression of three cell cycle markers , Rb , p21 and p16 , would provide helpful prognostic information in a well characterised series of prostate cancers which were clinically localised and treated conservatively .	
20854069-0	AIMS Treatment decisions are difficult in clinically localised prostate cancer and further biomarkers of aggressive behaviour are required .	
20854069-3	RESULTS Rb overexpression did not show any significant association with Gleason score or prostate cancer survival. p21 protein expression showed a significant association with prostate cancer survival ( p = 0.02 ) and overall survival ( p = 0.01 ) in a univariate model but not in a multivariate model with pathological and serum PSA data .	511 5 51
20854069-2	METHODS The immunohistochemical staining expression of these markers was assessed in tissue microarrays and correlated with 10 year prostate cancer survival and overall survival and then compared with pathological data including contemporary Gleason score , age , measures of tumour extent and initial serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level .	
22848179-4	This has resulted in the creation of the new area of nanotoxicology , which addresses the toxicological aspects of these materials .	
22848179-5	PURPOSE AND METHODS Contributing to these developments , the present work involved a genotoxicological study of different nanofibers , employing chromosomal aberration and comet assays , as well as cytogenetic and molecular analyses , to obtain preliminary information concerning nanofiber safety .	
22848179-6	The methodology consisted of exposure of Allium cepa roots , and animal cell cultures ( lymphocytes and fibroblasts ) , to different types of nanofibers .	
20588232-2	DESIGN Prospective study .	
22848179-0	BACKGROUND Agricultural products and by products provide the primary materials for a variety of technological applications in diverse industrial sectors .	
22848179-1	Agro-industrial wastes , such as cotton and curaua fibers , are used to prepare nanofibers for use in thermoplastic films , where they are combined with polymeric matrices , and in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering , amongst other applications .	
22848179-2	The development of products containing nanofibers offers a promising alternative for the use of agricultural products , adding value to the chains of production .	
22848179-3	However , the emergence of new nanotechnological products demands that their risks to human health and the environment be evaluated .	
23142824-3	Cdt1 and Geminin are strictly expressed in distinct subpopulations of young fibroblasts , similarly to cancer cells , with Geminin accumulating shortly after the onset of S phase .	
23142824-2	Here , we characterize the cell cycle expression pattern of Cdt1 and Geminin during successive passages of primary fibroblasts and compare it to tumour-derived cell lines .	
23142824-1	Cdt1 is a central regulator of DNA replication licensing acting during the G1 phase and it is negatively controlled by Geminin .	
23254306-14	A review of the crucial protein complexes revealed that the concentration of active CycE/CDK2-p that controls cell cycle arrest provides support for the above findings with CycE/CDK2-p undergoing the largest reduction ( over 100% ) under the combined CDK2&CKI conditions leading to the arrest of most of the damaged cells .	
23254306-15	Our study thus provides quantitative assessments for the previously published qualitative findings on senescence and highlights new avenues for bringing forward senescence bar .	
23142824-0	Cellular senescence is a permanent out-of-cycle state regulated by molecular circuits acting during the G1 phase of the cell cycle .	
23254306-10	Specifically , CDK2 and p27 are the most effective in triggering senescence while p21 having a smaller influence .	
23254306-11	While receiving experimental support , these findings specify in detail the inhibitory effects of CKIs .	
23254306-12	However , simultaneous variation of CDK2 and CKIs produces a dramatic reduction of damage cells passing the G1/S with CDK2&p27 combination causing senescence in almost all damaged cells .	
23254306-13	This combined effect of CDK2&CKIs on senescence is a novel contribution in this study .	
20588232-9	The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were higher in ascites of cancer patients than in ascites of women with benign tumors .	a 2 a2 21
22970388-4	Results .	
20588232-8	Moreover , women with very advanced cancer in whom the optimal cytoreduction was disabled had the highest serum levels of IL-10 , TGF-beta1 and IL-8 .	a 2 a2 21
20889718-0	Estrogen receptor α ( ERα ) expression in breast cancer is predictive of response to endocrine therapy ; however , resistance is common in ERα-positive tumors that overexpress the growth factor receptor ERBB2 .	
20889718-1	Even in the absence of estrogen , ERα can be activated by growth factors , including the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) .	
20889718-2	EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen ; however , the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown .	
20889718-3	Here we show that the EGF-induced ERα genomic targets , its cistromes , are distinct from those induced by estrogen in a process dependent on the transcription factor AP-1 .	9 93 92
20889718-4	The EGF-induced ERα cistrome specifically regulates genes found overexpressed in ERBB2-positive human breast cancers .	9 93 92
20889718-5	This provides a potential molecular explanation for the endocrine therapy resistance seen in ERα-positive breast cancers that overexpress ERBB2 .	9 93
20889718-6	These results suggest a central role for ERα in hormone-refractory breast tumors dependent on growth factor pathway activation and favors the development of therapeutic strategies completely antagonizing ERα , as opposed to blocking its estrogen responsiveness alone .	9 93
22495714-10	CONCLUSIONS Interestingly , the results of the present study indicate that breast tumors exhibit a higher level of A3 transcripts ( than normal tissues ) and support the possible key role of A3 adenosine receptor in tumor development .	9 93
23142824-4	Cdt1 and Geminin are down-regulated when primary human and mouse fibroblasts undergo replicative or stress-induced senescence .	42 4
1315291-0	5-HT1c receptors have been shown to act as protooncogenes in NIH 3T3 cells , inducing ligand-dependent focus formation .	
1315291-1	In order to assess their mitogenic and oncogenic potential in a different cell system , we transfected these receptors into CCL39 hamster fibroblasts , a well-characterized growth factor-dependent cell line .	
1315291-2	Cell clones expressing functional receptors were isolated and tested for ( a ) growth factor dependence of proliferation measuring thymidine incorporation in response to varying doses of serum , ( b ) the response to serotonin alone or in combination with other growth factors , and ( c ) the capacity for anchorage-independent proliferation .	
1315291-3	In the absence or presence of serotonin , the large majority of the clones isolated showed normal morphology and normal growth factor dependence and was unable to grow in soft agar .	9 92
1315291-4	None of the clones showed a significant response to serotonin alone in DNA synthesis reinitiation experiments , but synergy was observed between serotonin and the tyrosine kinase activating growth factors EGF and FGF .	9 92
1315291-5	However , the major part of this effect could be abolished by an antagonist of 5-HT1b receptors , which are endogenous in CCL39 cells .	9 93
1315291-6	The same receptor was found to mediate a significant mitogenic response to the neurotransmitter in Ha-ras-transfected cells .	9 93
1315291-7	The fact that 5-HT1c receptors do not readily induce a transformed phenotype in CCL39 cells clearly distinguishes them from strong dominantly acting oncogene products like RAS , SRC , or FMS .	9 93
22427941-2	However , the role of KGF in cutaneous carcinogenesis and cancer progression is not known .	
22427941-3	We have examined the role of KGF in progression of squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the skin .	
22427941-0	Keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF , fibroblast growth factor-7 ) is a fibroblast-derived mitogen , which stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells .	
22427941-1	The expression of KGF by dermal fibroblasts is induced following injury and it promotes wound repair .	
22427941-6	KGF did not stimulate SCC cell proliferation , but it reduced invasion of SCC cells through collagen .	11 1 92 9
22427941-7	Gene expression profiling of three cutaneous SCC cell lines treated with KGF for 24 h revealed a specific gene expression signature characterized by upregulation of a set of genes specifically downregulated in SCC cells compared to normal epidermal keratinocytes , including genes with tumor suppressing properties ( SPRY4 , DUSP4 , DUSP6 , LRIG1 , PHLDA1 ) .	
22427941-4	The expression of KGF receptor ( KGFR ) mRNA was lower in cutaneous SCCs ( n = 6 ) than in normal skin samples ( n = 6 ) .	9 93
22427941-5	Expression of KGFR mRNA was detected in 6 out of 8 cutaneous SCC cell lines and the levels were downregulated by 24-h treatment with KGF .	9 93
22427941-8	KGF also induced downregulation of a set of genes specifically upregulated in SCC cells compared to normal keratinocytes , including genes associated with tumor progression ( MMP13 , MATN2 , CXCL10 , and IGFBP3 ) .	
22389691-8	The generation of DSBs through inducible expression of I-SceI , in combination with single molecule PCR , provides an effective and efficient method for analysis of individual repair junctions and will prove a useful tool in the analysis of NHEJ .	
23232625-0	Vascular integrity is fundamental to the formation of mature blood vessels and depends on a functional , quiescent endothelial monolayer .	
23197380-7	AQP1 protein level , in AQP1 knockdown tumours , was around 75 % that of the controls and was associated with a significant 40 % reduced expression of the endothelial marker , Factor VIII .	
23232625-1	However , how endothelial cells enter and maintain quiescence in the presence of angiogenic factors is still poorly understood .	
23222813-7	Collectively , our results suggest that CTHRC1 has a role in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis by regulating migration and adhesion activities of cancer cells .	1
22427941-9	Downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression in SCC cells and HaCaT cells was mediated via ERK1/2 .	
23232625-7	At confluence , Spry2 expression correlates with intact cell-cell contacts , whereas disruption of cell-cell contacts by EGTA , TNFα and thrombin decreases Spry2 protein expression .	5 52
23232625-4	Importantly , the anti-proliferative effect of Spry2 is absent in sparsely plated cells .	
23232625-5	This cell density-dependent Spry2 function correlates with highly increased Spry2 expression in confluent wild type MAECs .	
23308053-9	Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that reactivation of pRB can potentially modulate the expression of the angiogenic phenotype through regulation of NOL7 .	7 71
23308053-8	Current anti-angiogenic therapies lack long-term efficacy , as they are unable to target the diverse angiogenic signals generated by tumors .	
23308053-5	Conversely , the loss of RB represses NOL7 transcription by inhibiting assembly of these proteins .	
23308053-4	In this study , we show that the RB tumor suppressor gene ( RB ) positively regulates NOL7 at the transcriptional level by recruiting transcription factors and transcription machinery proteins to its promoter region .	
23308053-7	Together , this work further characterizes the transcriptional activator function of RB and defines a potential role for RB in regulating angiogenesis through activation of NOL7 .	7 71
23308053-6	This loss of NOL7 expression is also observed in RB-deficient human malignancies .	
23308053-1	Nuclear protein 7 ( NOL7 ) , a novel tumor suppressor , acts as a master regulator of angiogenesis by downregulating pro-angiogenic factors and upregulating anti-angiogenic factors .	
23308053-0	The expression of the angiogenic phenotype is regulated by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors released into the tumor microenvironment .	
23308053-3	Analysis of the gene failed to identify tumor-specific promoter methylation or coding region mutations , suggesting that NOL7 loss may be mediated by aberrant expression of its upstream regulators .	
23308053-2	Using cervical cancer as a model of investigation , we have previously shown that loss of NOL7 mRNA and protein expression is observed as early as the premalignant phase .	
23028984-3	Under steady-state conditions , immune system parameters in c-Myc(fl/fl) LysM(cre/+) mice appeared normal , including the abundance of different subsets of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells , precursors and circulating cells , macrophage density , and immune organ structure .	2 21
23028984-2	In this study , we exploited the predominant expression of LysM in myeloid cells to generate c-Myc(fl/fl) LysM(cre/+) mice , which lack c-Myc in macrophages , to investigate the role of macrophage c-MYC expression in cancer .	
23028984-1	The transcription factor c-MYC has been recently shown to regulate in vitro human macrophage polarization and be expressed in macrophages infiltrating human tumors .	
23028984-0	Although tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs ) are involved in tumor growth and metastasis , the mechanisms controlling their pro-tumoral activities remain largely unknown .	
12506039-9	These results indicate that cell-surface expression of the HTLV SU binding protein is up-regulated during in vitro activation and suggest a role for the HTLV-I SU binding proteins in the immunobiology of CD4(+) T cells .	2 21
12506039-8	When incubated with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a mixed leukocyte reaction , HTSU-IgG inhibited proliferation at less than 1 ng/mL .	
23028984-5	Macrophage c-Myc deletion also diminished fibrosarcoma growth .	
23028984-4	In a model of melanoma , however , TAMs lacking c-Myc displayed a delay in maturation and showed an attenuation of pro-tumoral functions ( e.g. , reduced expression of VEGF , MMP9 , and HIF1α ) that was associated with impaired tissue remodeling and angiogenesis and limited tumor growth in c-Myc(fl/fl) LysM(cre/+) mice .	
12506039-5	Naive ( CD45RA(high) , CD62L(high) ) CD4(+) T cells derived from cord blood cells , in contrast to other primary cells and all cell lines examined , bound no detectable HTLV-I SU .	2 21
12506039-4	Cell stimulation dramatically increased the amount of binding , with the highest levels of binding on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells .	2 21
12506039-7	In contrast to HTLV-I virions , the soluble HTSU-IgG did not effect T-cell activation or proliferation .	
12506039-6	However , following stimulation , the level of HTSU-IgG binding was rapidly induced ( fewer than 6 hours ) , reaching the level of binding seen on adult CD4(+) T cells by 72 hours .	2 21
12506039-1	Recently , we have generated an HTLV-I surface glycoprotein ( SU ) immunoadhesin , HTSU-IgG , which binds specifically to cell-surface protein(s) critical for HTLV-I-mediated entry in cell lines .	
12506039-0	Little is known about the requirements for human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) entry , including the identity of the cellular receptor(s) .	
12506039-3	The immunoadhesin specifically bound to adult T cells , B cells , NK cells , and macrophages .	2 21
12506039-2	Here , expression of the HTLV-I SU binding protein on primary cells of the immune system was examined .	
1423284-2	Using monoclonal antibodies we have shown that one complex , B1 , contains human single-stranded DNA binding protein , a protein known to be involved in the in vitro repair synthesis assay of mammalian excision repair .	612 62 61 6
1423284-0	The chemotherapeutic drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) covalently binds to DNA resulting in a variety of adducts and cross-links which are thought to be responsible for the toxicity of the drug .	
1423284-1	We have used the gel mobility shift assay to detect proteins which bind to DNA treated in vitro with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) and have identified two complexes which bind with increased affinity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II)-damaged DNA .	61 6
12244187-10	In conclusion , peritumoral CpG ODN monotherapy elicits a strong CD8 T cell response and innate effector mechanisms that seem to act in concert to overcome unresponsiveness of the immune system toward a growing tumor .	2 21
23281044-0	Aurora kinases play an essential role in mitotic progression and are potentially druggable targets in cancer therapy .	
23204518-0	Osteopontin ( OPN ) , which is highly expressed in malignant glioblastoma ( GBM ) , possesses inflammatory activity that is modulated by proteolytic cleavage by thrombin and plasma carboxypeptidase B2 ( CPB2 ) at a highly conserved cleavage site .	
23204518-1	Full length OPN ( OPN-FL ) was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) samples from all cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients .	
23204518-2	However thrombin-cleaved OPN ( OPN-R ) and thrombin/CPB2-double cleaved OPN ( OPN-L ) levels were markedly increased in GBM and non-GBM gliomas compared to systemic cancer and non-cancer patients .	
23204518-3	Cleaved OPN constituted and of the total OPN in the GBM and non-GBM CSF samples respectively .	
23204518-4	OPN-R was also elevated in GBM tissues .	
23204518-5	Thrombin-antithrombin levels were highly correlated with cleaved OPN , but not OPN-FL , suggesting that the cleaved OPN fragments resulted from increased thrombin and CPB2 in this extracellular compartment .	
22867999-1	Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , followed by somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele and known to be a highly metastatic and lethal malignancy compared to other RCCs .	
23204518-7	GBM cell lines were significantly more adherent to OPN-R and OPN-L than OPN-FL .	
23204518-8	Adhesion to OPN altered gene expression , in particular genes involved with cellular processes , cell cycle regulation , death and inflammation .	
23204518-9	OPN promoted motility of U-87 MG cells and conferred resistance to apoptosis .

23222813-4	Overexpression of CTHRC1 in cancer cells resulted in increased motility and adhesiveness , whereas these cellular activities were diminished by down-regulation of the protein .	
22763454-4	This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 ( also known as TAK1 ) kinase .	
12579898-14	CONCLUSION The developed method is very simple , and the corresponding instrument is inexpensive and easy to operate , which can be used to detect many types of mutation .	63 6
22327365-4	Knockdown of either Ikbkb or Timp1 by short hairpin RNAs reduced tumour growth in both xenograft and lentiviral models .	
12579898-12	In addition , the three possible variants ( wildtype , mutant and heterozygote ) of a mutant point Cys275Ser in P53 gene exon 8 were determined by pyrosequencing using the instrument .	63 6
12579898-13	A simple method was also described for rapidly distinguishing the type of a variant .	
12579898-10	Each dNTP was delivered by adding a gas pressure on the top of a corresponding dNTP reservoir , by which 0.2 microL of dNTP can be exactly added each time .	
12579898-11	It was theoretically proved that undesired liquid seep through the capillary did not affect the sequencing reactions in pyrosequencing .	
23267699-20	IPA analysis also represents new molecule mechanism of YM155 treatment , such as NR3C1 and dexamethasone may be new target of YM155 .	
23267699-21	And our results may provide new clues of molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by YM155 .	8 81
22763454-5	In humans , formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes , and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases .	
12531021-0	We have made xeroderma pigmentosum group A gene ( XPA)-knockout mice ( XPA(-/-) mice ) .	
12531021-1	The XPA(-/-) mice had no detectable activity for nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and showed a high incidence of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis .	62 6
12531021-2	We have also found that cell lines derived from skin cancers in UVB-irradiated XPA(-/-) mice become tolerant to UV-irradiation and showed abnormal UV-induced cell cycle checkpoints and decreased mismatch repair ( MMR ) activity .	51 62 5 6 511
12531021-3	These results suggested that the MMR-downregulation may help cells escape killing by UV-irradiation and thus MMR-deficient clones are selected for during the tumorigenic transformation of XPA(-/-) cells .	
12531021-4	In this report , we examined whether the incidence of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis is enhanced in XPA(-/-)MSH2(-/-) , XPA(-/-) and MSH2(-/-) mice when compared with that in wild-type mice .	
12531021-5	Our results indicate that the MSH2-deficiency caused a high incidence of spontaneous and UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis and the XPA and MSH2 genes have additive roles in the UV-induced skin tumorigenesis .	
22763454-6	Thus , molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer .	
22024718-8	Our present data provide useful information for the toxicological effects of Tempol in juxtaglomerular cells in relation to cell growth inhibition and cell death .	
23211746-8	Thus , multiple nucleases collaborate to initiate DNA damage responses , highlighting the importance of these responses to cellular fitness .	61 6
22024718-2	Tempol dose-dependently decreased the growth of As4.1 cells with an IC50 of at 48h .	
23093405-0	In cancer , glucose uptake and glycolysis are increased regardless of the oxygen concentration in the cell , a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect .	
22024718-4	Furthermore , Tempol increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels , and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) .	
1470779-0	This is a case report of a 69-year-old woman with sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , which was diagnosed clinically as hemangioma .	
23209410-10	Combining this Southern methodology with a CPD-specific T4 endonuclease V alkaline agarose assay to quantitate repair of adducts , we found efficient repair of CPDs from the viral DNA but not host cellular DNA .	62 6
22213297-7	Inhibition of tumor growth , survival increase and the reduction of TNF-α and IL-6 levels in rats bearing W256 treated with naringin strongly suggest that this compound has potential as an anticarcinogenic drug .	
1470779-7	Although the largest part of the tumor revealed necrosis and hyalinization , a sarcomatoid part composed of spindle-shaped cells was noted in the peripheral portion .	83 8
22428047-5	We found that blockade of lactate influx into ECs led to inhibition of HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis .	7 71
20442453-5	Finally , the tumor stroma of " metastasis-prone " breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease .	
20442453-4	We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress , DNA damage/repair , inflammation , hypoxia , and aerobic glycolysis , consistent with the " Reverse Warburg Effect " .	a21 31 3 62 a2 a 6
20442453-7	These processes may include oxidative stress , NO over-production ( peroxynitrite formation ) , inflammation , hypoxia , and mitochondrial dysfunction , which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology .	
20442453-6	This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress .	
20442453-1	Here , we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 ( -/- ) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers .	
20442453-0	Caveolin-1 ( -/- ) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts .	
20442453-3	This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein ( by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment ) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis .	
20442453-2	More specifically , the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node ( LN ) metastasis .	
20442453-8	Thus , a loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated myofibroblasts may be a protein biomarker for oxidative stress , aerobic glycolysis , and inflammation , driving the " Reverse Warburg Effect " in the tumor micro-environment and cancer cell metastasis .	a21 31 3 a2 a
1470779-6	At autopsy , a well defined yellowish white tumor of 3 cm in maximum diameter was seen in the cirrhotic liver .	
23293472-11	The IL-18 levels also differed significantly ( P < 0.05 ) with smokers and chewers in higher stages of III and IV , and showed non significant with in lower stages .	
23293472-10	Moreover , the IL-18 levels between cancer patients and controls with in of combined mode chewers smokers and alcohol ( CSA ) , smokers with alcohol showed significant difference ( P < 0.01 ) than controls .	
23293472-12	Tobacco exposure enhance the inflammation in prostate carcinoma patients in stratified group as it have been represented as a risk factors in various cancers , but this study provide further its role that seems to influence inflammation especially in prostate carcinoma .	a a2
22593693-4	The percentage of after-treatment keloids and hypertrophic scars observed was very low ( especially upon the usage of lower parameters .	
23238993-0	TP53 mutations compromising p53 transcriptional function occur in more than 50% of human cancers , including pancreatic adenocarcinoma , and render cancer cells more resistant to conventional therapy .	
23238993-1	In the last few years , many efforts have been addressed to identify p53-reactivating molecules able to restore the wild-type transcriptionally competent conformation of the mutated proteins .	
23238993-2	Here , we show that two of these compounds , CP-31398 and RITA , induce cell growth inhibition , apoptosis , and autophagy by activating p53/DNA binding and p53 phosphorylation ( Ser15 ) , without affecting the total p53 amount .	82 81 8
23238993-3	These effects occur in both wild-type and mutant p53 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines , whereas they are much less pronounced in normal human primary fibroblasts .	
23238993-4	Furthermore , CP-31398 and RITA regulate the axis SESN1-2/AMPK/mTOR by inducing AMPK phosphorylation on Thr172 , which has a crucial role in the autophagic response .	82 8
23238993-5	The protective role of autophagy in cell growth inhibition by CP-31398 and RITA is supported by the finding that the AMPK inhibitor compound C or the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine or 3-methyladenine sensitize both pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines to the apoptotic response induced by p53-reactivating molecules .	82 81 8
23238993-6	Our results demonstrate for the first time a survival role for autophagy induced by p53-reactivating molecules , supporting the development of an anti-cancer therapy based on autophagy inhibition associated to p53 activation .	82 8
23201559-6	TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold .	
23201559-7	Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair .	9 62 6 91 8 81
23201559-4	The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes , specifically , the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively .	
23201559-5	Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly .	
23201559-2	The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay .	
23201559-3	The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array .	
23201559-0	Many molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of doxorubicin resistance and different cancers can express wide and diverse arrays of drug-resistance genes .	
22593693-5	The recurrence of viral lesions ( condylomas and warts ) have been not more frequent than those due to other techniques .	
23201559-8	The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process .	
23269235-10	Inhibition of autophagy may be a promising therapeutic option for improving the anti-tumor effect of sunitinib .	82 8
23011762-5	Plasma samples were obtained before surgery .	
23011762-4	The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were determined by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .	
23011762-7	RESULTS The levels of the HNPs increased from grade 1 to 4 tumors and this difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) .	
23011762-6	Plasma samples were permitted to clot and were then stored at -80 �C until use .	
23011762-1	However , the role of HNPs 1-3 in human bladder cancer has not yet been determined .	
23011762-0	OBJECTIVES Human neutrophil proteins-1 , -2 , and -3 ( HNPs -1 , -2 , and -3 ) are expressed in several tumor types .	
23011762-3	DESIGN AND METHODS The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were measured in 60 patients with bladder cancer and in 58 healthy controls .	
23011762-2	We investigated the association between the plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 and clinicopathological parameters in bladder cancer patients .	
23011762-9	CONCLUSIONS The preoperative plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 paralleled the progression and pathological stages of the malignancies .	
23011762-8	Additionally , plasma HNP levels were significantly higher in patients with metastatic bladder cancer and in patients with lymphovascular involvement , metastasis of the lymph nodes , and increased tumor burden ( p < 0.001 ) .	1 12
23131583-3	Our results showed significantly reduced expression of non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair genes , DNA Pkcs , DNA ligase4 , and Xrcc4 leading to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase .	91 62 9 6
20331621-11	Hence , in addition to being an attractive candidate compound with therapeutic potential , cantharidin also highlighted the possibility of using PP2A as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer treatment .	
20331621-10	Inhibition of JNK , but not ERK or p38 , alleviated the cytotoxity effect of cantharidin , suggesting cantharidin exerted its anticancer effect through the JNK-dependent way .	921 92 9
22593693-0	The CO(2) laser has been used extensively in dermatological surgery over the past 30 years and is now recognised as the gold standard for soft tissue vaporization .	
20122407-2	Here , we describe a synthetic lethal interaction between the C. elegans helicase helq-1 and RAD-51 paralog rfs-1 , which results in a block to meiotic DSB repair after strand invasion .	62 6
20122407-1	Although the mechanisms of RAD-51-DNA filament assembly and strand exchange are well characterized , the subsequent steps of HR are less well defined .	
20133837-4	We further show that the M1-specific exon is actively repressed in cancer-cell lines--although some M1 mRNA is expressed in cell lines derived from brain tumors--and demonstrate that the related splicing repressors hnRNP A1 and A2 , as well as the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein PTB , contribute to this control .	
20133837-5	Downregulation of these splicing repressors in cancer-cell lines using shRNAs rescues M1 isoform expression and decreases the extent of lactate production .	
20133837-6	These findings extend the links between alternative splicing and cancer , and begin to define some of the factors responsible for the switch to aerobic glycolysis .	31 3
20122407-0	Homologous recombination ( HR ) is essential for repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .	
20133837-0	Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose by aerobic glycolysis , characterized by increased lactate production .	
20133837-1	This distinctive metabolism involves expression of the embryonic M2 isozyme of pyruvate kinase , in contrast to the M1 isozyme normally expressed in differentiated cells , and it confers a proliferative advantage to tumor cells .	
20133837-2	The M1 and M2 pyruvate-kinase isozymes are expressed from a single gene through alternative splicing of a pair of mutually exclusive exons .	
20133837-3	We measured the expression of M1 and M2 mRNA and protein isoforms in mouse tissues , tumor cell lines , and during terminal differentiation of muscle cells , and show that alternative splicing regulation is sufficient to account for the levels of expressed protein isoforms .	
23144635-5	The rs3136797 SNP encodes the P242R variant Pol \u03b2 protein and biochemical analysis showed that P242R protein had a slower catalytic rate than WT , although P242R binds DNA similarly to WT .	
22593693-1	Considering that the continuous wave CO(2) laser delivery system and the newer " superpulsed " and scanned CO(2) systems have progressively changed our practice and patient satisfaction , a long range documentation can be useful .	
20122407-5	These results indicate that two compensating activities are required to promote postsynaptic RAD-51 filament disassembly , which are collectively essential for completion of meiotic DSB repair .	62 6
23142824-7	In contrast , ectopic expression of Geminin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts delays the appearance of the senescent phenotype .	42 4
23144635-4	Following treatment with an alkylating agent , cells expressing this coding SNP accumulated BER intermediate substrates , including single-strand and double-strand breaks .	612 62 61 6
23180966-8	Further investigation with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that high expression of \u03b3-H2AX remained an independent prognostic factor of shorter overall survival ( HR 2.15 , 95% CI : 1.22-3.79 , P = 0.026 ) .	612 61 6
22593693-2	Our experience has demonstrated that the use of CO(2) laser involves a reduced healing time , an infrequent need for anaesthesia , reduced thermal damage , less bleeding , less inflammation , the possibility of intra-operative histologic and/or cytologic examination , and easy access to anatomically difficult areas .	
23137536-7	Finally , CKIIα overexpression antagonized senescence induced by the four miRNA mimics .	42 4
23180966-9	A combined p53/\u03b3-H2AX analysis was performed , and we found that the p53 low/\u03b3-H2AX low phenotype was associated with significantly better survival compared with all other phenotypes .	612 61 6
22593693-3	Immediate side effects have been pain , erythema , edema , typically see with older methods , using higher power .	
12530080-0	The triterpenoid fraction ( 100 and 200 mg/kg ) of the fruit bodies of Ganoderma lucidum inhibited primary solid-tumor growth in the spleen , liver metastasis and secondary metastatic tumor growth in the liver in intrasplenic Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC)-implanted mice .	1 12
12530080-1	In addition , the triterpenoid fraction ( 800 micrograms/mL ) inhibited angiogenesis induced by Matrigel ( a soluble basement membrane extract of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swam ( EHS ) tumor ) supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and heparin in an in vivo model .	71 7 711
12530080-2	This suggested that the antitumor and antimetastatic activities of the triterpenoid fraction of G. lucidum might be due to the inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis .	1 12 7 71
12530080-3	Next , we attempted to isolate the active substance(s) using the in vivo assay system of Matrigel-induced angiogenesis .	
12530080-4	The acidic fraction of the triterpenoid fraction inhibited the Matrigel-induced angiogenesis .	7 71
12530080-5	Compound I was isolated from the acidic fraction as an active substance that inhibited the Martigel-induced angiogenesis .	7 71
12530080-6	Compound I was identified as ganoderic acid F based on the data of IR , 1H- and 13C-NMR and MS analyses .	
1334154-14	Following therapy with BCNU plus O6-benzylguanine at 0.38 LD10 , tumor regressions were seen in eight of 10 D341 Med and in all 10 D-456 MG xenografts .	
22215664-1	However , blockade of EGFR is therapeutically disappointing for gliomas with PTEN deletion .	
22215664-0	Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , frequently expressed as a constitutively active deletion mutant ( EGFRvIII ) , occurs commonly in glioblastoma multiformes ( GBM ) .	
12244187-5	The injection site was critical , since injection of CpG ODN at distant sites was not effective .	
23232625-10	Moreover , inhibiting Erk1/2 activity in Spry2 knockout cells restores wild type cobblestone monolayer morphology .	
19003298-3	Here we show that suppression of a gap junctional protein connexin 43 ( Cx43 ) plays an important role in in vivo tumorigenesis induced by PEUs for the first time and that Cx43 transfection may be an effective strategy for preventing tumorigenesis induced by biomaterials .	
19003298-2	We have shown that the different inhibitory potential of gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) on the surface of the biomaterials , including PEUs , is a key step in determining the tumorigenic potential .	
19003298-1	However , PEUs can induce tumors in subcutaneous implantation sites in rat .	
19003298-0	Biomaterials such as polyetherurethans ( PEUs ) are the scaffolding , which is indispensable for the development of the bio-artificial organs .	
19003298-7	These results strongly suggest that suppression of Cx43 expression plays an important role in the development of rat malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( MFHC ) caused by PEUs and that Cx43 transfection is effective for prevention of tumorigenesis induced by PEUs .	
19003298-6	The restoration of normal phenotype , such as reduction of growth rate , recovery of contact inhibition and loss of colony formation ability in soft agar , was achieved by Cx43 transfection .	5 52
19003298-5	The GJIC and the expression of Cx43 were suppressed in U41 .	
19003298-4	Rat tumor cell line U41 is derived from tumors in the subcutaneous implantation of PEU films .	
22215664-5	It dually inhibits EGFR and PKCs , resulting in a blockade of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and cell cycle arrest in the G(1) phase , which leads to activation of apoptosis in the tumors .	
20080488-3	Number of cells with nuclear RAD51 expression was significantly ( P < or = .05 ) increased in carcinomas when compared to adenomas and metastases .	
22215664-4	It directly inhibits EGFR and PKCs with IC(50) values of and 5 μM , respectively .	
23167425-0	Invasion and metastasis are the major causes of cancer-related death .	
22215664-6	Hence , combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and PKCs might provide proof of concept in developing therapeutic agents for treating malignant glioma and other human cancers .	
23232625-11	This study thus reveals a novel Spry2 function , which mediates endothelial contact inhibition and barrier integrity .	5 52
20331621-7	Activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 suggested that both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis .	8 81
20331621-6	It induced apoptosis and elevated the expressions of pro-apoptotic factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , TNF-related apoptosis inducing receptor 1 ( TRAILR1 ) , TRAILR2 , Bad , Bak , and Bid , and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 .	8 81
20331621-5	It caused G2/M cell-cycle arrest that was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) and up-regulation of p21 expression .	511 5 51
20331621-4	Cantharidin efficiently inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells , but presented a much lighter toxicity effect against normal pancreatic duct cells .	
20331621-3	In the present study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of cantharidin in pancreatic cancer .	
20331621-2	Owing to its antitumor activity , cantharidin has been frequently used in clinical practice .	
20331621-1	It is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) that plays an important role in control of cell cycle , apoptosis , and cell-fate determination .	
20331621-0	Cantharidin is an active constituent of mylabris , a traditional Chinese medicine .	
20080488-2	Here , RAD51 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded mammary carcinomas and their lymph node metastases of 40 dogs , adenomas of 48 dogs , and nonneoplastic mammary gland of 88 dogs .	
20331621-9	Mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , including ERK , JNK , and p38 , were activated after treatment with cantharidin .	921 92 9
20331621-8	Interestingly , unlike previous studies on other cancer cells , we found that the inhibitory role of cantharidin is independent of oxidative stress in pancreatic cancer cells .	
19881551-7	Moreover , FBP1 downregulation was reversed by pharmacological demethylation .	
19881551-6	Restoration of FBP1 expression reduced growth and glycolysis in gastric cancer cells .	31 3
19881551-5	Indeed , FBP1 was downregulated in gastric carcinomas ( P<0.01 , n=22 ) and gastric cancer cell lines ( 57% , 4/7 ) .	
19881551-4	Restoration of FBP1 expression suppressed anchorage-independent growth , indicating the relevance of FBP1 downregulation in carcinogenesis .	
19881551-3	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 ( FBP1 ) , which functions to antagonize glycolysis was downregulated through NF-kappaB pathway in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells .	31 3
19881551-2	Herein , we proposed an epigenetic mechanism of the Warburg effect .	31 3
19881551-1	The reason that cancer cells have a higher rate of aerobic glycolysis , but not oxidative phosphorylation , remains largely unclear .	
19881551-0	In cancer cells , glucose is often converted into lactic acid , which is known as the ' Warburg effect ' .	
23232625-8	In confluent cells , high Spry2 levels correlate with decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( Erk1/2 ) phosphorylation .	
23232625-9	In contrast , dense Spry2 knockout MAECs exhibit enhanced signaling by Erk1/2 .	
19881551-9	Inhibition of NF-kappaB restored FBP1 expression , partially through demethylation of FBP1 promoter .	
19881551-8	Its promoter was hypermethylated in gastric cancer cell lines ( 57% , 4/7 ) and gastric carcinomas ( 33% , 33/101 ) .	
23281044-1	We identified benzo[e]pyridoindoles ( BePI ) as powerful aurora kinase inhibitors .	
23142824-6	Mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous for Geminin exhibit accelerated senescence compared to control fibroblasts .	42 4
23281044-3	New BePI molecules were synthesized , and a structure-activity relationship study was conducted with the aim of improving the activity and solubility of the lead compound .	
23281044-2	Their efficiency was demonstrated both in enzymatic inhibition studies and in cell culture assays .	
23281044-5	New hydrosoluble benzo[e]pyridoindolones were subsequently designed , and their efficacy was tested by a combination of cell-cycle analysis and time-lapse experiments in live cells .	
23281044-4	Tetracyclic BePI derivatives are characterized by a particular curved shape , and the presence of an oxo group on the pyridine ring was found to be required for aurora kinase B inhibition .	
23281044-7	It exhibited high antiproliferative activity in HeLa cells with an IC(50) value of 63 nM .	
23281044-6	The most active BePI derivative , 13 b , inhibited the cell cycle , drove cells to polyploidy , and eventually induced apoptosis .	9 51 511 5 91 8 81
23281044-9	Our results justify further in vivo evaluation in preclinical animal models of cancer .	
23281044-8	Relative to compounds tested in clinical trials , this antiproliferative potency places 13 b among the top 10 aurora kinase inhibitors .	
23167425-6	It was observed that cell death mediated by EGCG was through apoptosis .	8 81
23144635-3	Expression of this SNP in both human and mouse cells induced double-strand breaks , chromosomal aberrations , and cellular transformation .	612 61 6
1582349-0	We assayed the estrogen and progesterone cytosolic receptors by using the enzyme immunoassay method , the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) cell surface receptors by using 125I-labeled hormone , and the levels of polyamines ( putrescine , spermine , and spermidine ) by using a high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) procedure in neoplastic and surrounding normal tissues of patients with colorectal cancer .	
1582349-1	Our findings show that mean polyamine levels in neoplastic tissue were approximately two-fold greater than the levels in normal colonic mucosa .	
1582349-2	Estrogen and progesterone receptorial content in normal mucosa were twofold greater than those in neoplastic tissue .	9 93
1582349-3	No significant differences in EGF receptors were found between colonic cancer tissue and the surrounding normal tissues .	9 93
1582349-4	The correlations we found between 1 ) estrogen and polyamine levels and 2 ) estrogen and EGF binding suggest the existence of a modulation of the estrogens on colonic mucosa cell proliferation .	9 92
1582349-5	Furthermore , there was no significant dependency of polyamine and receptor concentrations from the tumor site , the histologic differentiation , or the age and sex of patients .	9 93
20713694-7	We anticipate that this work will serve as a template for the comprehensive identification of pathways whose dysregulation can drive tumorigenesis through impaired karyotypic maintenance .	
20713694-6	Loss of several of the kinases leads to loss of contact inhibition and to anchorage-independent growth , vital traits acquired during tumor development .	5 52
20713694-5	We further show that sustained loss of the shRNA screening hits leads to multipolar spindles and heterogeneous chromosome content , two characteristics of chromosomal instability .	6
20713694-4	In both cDNA and shRNA screens , the majority of hits have not been linked previously to genomic stability .	
20713694-3	In a series of shRNA screens , we identified 16 kinases whose loss leads to increased ploidy .	
20713694-2	In a screen of a cDNA library , we identified 13 kinases whose overexpression leads to increased ploidy .	
20713694-1	We have approached this critical issue through the use of high-throughput screens in untransformed diploid epithelial cells .	
20713694-0	Chromosomal instability and the subsequent genetic mutations are considered to be critical factors in the development of the majority of solid tumors , but the mechanisms by which a stable diploid cell loses the ability to maintain genomic integrity are not well characterized .	
23267699-15	Death receptor signaling ( 3.87E-19 ) , TNFR1 signaling , induction of apoptosis by HIV1 , apoptosis signaling and molecular mechanisms of cancer came out to be the top four most significant pathways .	8 81
23267699-14	The IPA analysis also groups the differentially expressed genes into biological mechanisms that are related to cell death , cellular function maintenance , cell morphology , carbohydrate metabolism and cellular growth and proliferation .	
23267699-17	CONCLUSIONS : The present study demonstrates that YM155 treatment resulted in apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells .	8 81
23267699-16	IPA analysis also showed top molecules up-regulated were BBC3 , BIRC3 , BIRC8 , BNIP1 , CASP7 , CASP9 , CD5 , CDKN1A , CEBPG and COL4A3 , top molecules down-regulated were ZNF443 , UTP11L , TP73 , TNFSF10 , TNFRSF1B , TNFRSF25 , TIAF1 , STK17A , SST and SPP1 , upstream regulator were NR3C1 , TP53 , dexamethasone , TNF and Akt .	
23267699-11	YM155 treatment decreased weight of tumors ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.05 +/- 0.24 g ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.72 +/- 0.17 g ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 2.06 +/- 0.38 g ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 2.36 +/- 0.43 g , ANOVA P < 0.01 ) .	
23267699-10	YM155 significantly inhibited growth of SK-NEP-1 xenografts ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.45 +/- 0.77 cm3 ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.95 +/- 0.55 cm3 ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 3.70 +/- 2.4 cm3 ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 3.78 +/- 2.20 cm3 , ANOVA P < 0.01 ) .	
23267699-13	Ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA ) showed cell death was the highest rated network with 65 focus molecules and the significance score of 44 .	
23267699-12	Real-time PCR array analysis showed between Test group and control group there are 32 genes significantly up-regulated and 54 genes were significantly down-regulated after YM155 treatment .	
23267699-19	Real-time PCR array analysis firstly showed expression profile of genes dyes-regulated after YM155 treatment .	
23267699-18	YM155 had significant role and little side effect in the treatment of SK-NEP-1 xenograft tumors .	
22564725-10	CDK2 inhibitors hold promise as a component of combination therapies in endocrine-resistant disease as they effectively inhibit cyclin E1 and E2 overexpressing cells and enhance the efficacy of other therapeutics .	91 9
23161184-3	Increased vascularization in chorioallantoic membrane assay , increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings , and increased expression of CD31 , E-selectin in endothelial cells suggested a possible proangiogenic effect of citrate .	7 71
23161184-2	Therefore , the effect of citrate on angiogenesis was studied using different model systems .	
23161184-1	Although certain intermediates of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways have been known to affect angiogenesis , the effect of citrate , which accumulates in certain tumors , on angiogenesis is not known .	
23161184-0	Endothelial cells respond to hypoxic changes with resultant accumulation of several metabolites and switch over to angiogenic phenotype .	
23161184-7	Rapamycin , an inhibitor of mTOR , also reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and sprouting of aortic rings suggesting that the angiogenic effect of citrate involves activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway .	71 7 9 921 92
23161184-6	Citrate induced significant upregulation and activation of Akt in endothelial cells .	
23161184-5	LY 294002 , an inhibitor of PI3K-Akt pathway , and wortmannin , an inhibitor of Akt pathway , reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells .	
23161184-4	Upregulation of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor suggested that the effect of citrate involves modulation of expression of angiogenic growth factors .	71 7 711
21203561-9	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results identify a compelling link between FGFR4 signaling and the NFκB pathway , and reveal that FGFR4 activation leads to a negative effect on NFκB signaling including an inhibitory effect on proapoptotic signaling .	
21203561-8	Microarray analysis demonstrates that FGF19 + TNFα treatment of DU145 cells , in comparison with TNFα alone , favors proliferative genes while downregulating genes involved in apoptotic responses and NFκB signaling .	921 92 9
21203561-7	FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNFα-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKKβ activity , concomitant reduction in NFκB nuclear localization , and reduced apoptosis .	921 92 9
21203561-6	Following stimulation by TNFα ( Tumor Necrosis Factor α ) to activate NFκB pathways , FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NFκB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NFκB localization , by reduced NFκB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays , and by inhibition of IKKβ kinase activity towards the substrate GST-IκBα in in vitro assays .	921 92 9
21203561-5	We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKβ in the presence of activated FGFR4 , but not kinase-dead FGFR4 .	921 92 9
21203561-4	This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [ 1 ] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis .	
21203561-3	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here , we demonstrate an interaction between FGFR4 and IKKβ ( Inhibitor of NFκB Kinase β subunit ) , an essential component in the NFκB pathway .	9 93
21203561-2	However , a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NFκB activation has not been previously described , although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNFα-induced apoptosis .	
21203561-1	Receptor Tyrosine Kinases ( RTKs ) , including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ( FGFRs ) are also important in development and disease .	
21203561-0	BACKGROUND NFκB signaling is of paramount importance in the regulation of apoptosis , proliferation , and inflammatory responses during human development and homeostasis , as well as in many human cancers .	
21280565-11	In CS-exposed group , hepatic tissue exhibited vacuolization and macrophage infiltration .	
21133594-5	The results indicated that chronic occupational exposure to cement during construction work could lead to increased levels of DNA damage and repair inhibition .	61 62 6
21133594-4	Construction workers showed a significant increase in MN and comet tail length compared to controls with adjustment for smoking habits , tobacco chewing , alcohol consumption and years of exposure ( P<0.05 ) .	
21133594-1	Since there are no past studies on genotoxicity among this group in the Indian subcontinent , workers engaged in different construction sites at Coimbatore , Tamil Nadu , India , were assessed here .	
21133594-0	Construction industry workers are exposed to many known carcinogens in their complex occupational environment .	
21133594-3	DNA repair inhibition was also analyzed by assessing the XPD gene .	
21133594-2	We enrolled 96 workers and 68 control subjects with similar mean age , smoking , tobacco chewing prevalence and alcohol consumption , for analysis of DNA damage in blood leucocytes by micronucleus ( MN ) and comet assays .	
1480490-8	Particular genes , c-myc , fos and p53 , were found on broad distributions of photocleaved fragment lengths .	
1480490-9	The results indicate that on each side of the genes the locus of the chromatin fibre situated close to the nuclear membrane , varied randomly .	
23142824-5	RNAi-mediated Geminin knock-down in human cells enhances the appearance of phenotypic and molecular features of senescence .	42 4
1480490-4	Because DNA damage is produced mainly via singlet oxygen diffusing less than 0.1 microns from the sensitizer , DNA double-strand breaks were supposedly produced within this distance of the nuclear membrane .	
1480490-5	Consistent with this , with prolonged illumination and with increasing concentrations of sensitizer the distribution of DNA fragment lengths reached a plateau level .	
1480490-6	In contrast , with the hydrophilic , intranuclear sensitizer meso-tetra(4-sulphonatophenyl)porphyrin , no such plateau level was found .	
1480490-7	The plateau distributions of DNA fragment lengths of different cell types had the same general shape with average fragment lengths ranging from 174 to 194 kilobasepairs .	
1480490-0	We have exploited properties of photosensitizers to study an aspect of the packing of chromatin in the cell nucleus .	
1480490-1	The fluorescent photosensitizers mesotetra(3-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin and Photofrin II were both localized in the nuclear membrane and other membrane structures , but could not be found inside the nuclei .	
1480490-2	Light exposure of cells at 1 degrees C in the presence of the sensitizers induced DNA double-strand breaks .	612 61 6
1480490-3	The length distributions of DNA fragments were determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis .	
23255896-5	When sorafenib was combined with gemcitabine , synergistic activity was observed in the A549 and H1666 cells and antagonistic activity was observed in the H1975 cells .	
23255896-4	We found that sorafenib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in all three EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines .	
23255896-7	Sorafenib inhibited C-RAF and p-ERK in the A549 cells and B-RAF and p-ERK in the H1666 and H1975 cells .	
23255896-6	Sorafenib arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase , whereas gemcitabine arrested the cell cycle at the S phase .	9 51 511 5 91
23255896-1	In this study , we explored in vitro the antitumor effects of sorafenib alone and in combination with gemcitabine in epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI)-resistant human lung cancer cell lines and the related molecular mechanisms .	
23255896-0	Sorafenib is a multi-targeted agent and has been reported to have potent antitumor effects against various types of tumors , including human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
23255896-3	The cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay , cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry , and alterations in signaling pathways were analyzed by western blotting .	
23255896-2	The NSCLC cell lines A549 ( mutant KRAS ) , H1666 ( mutant BRAF ) and H1975 ( mutant EGFR-T790M ) were treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine alone and in combination .	
24174263-0	Effective glucose diet : We report the development and activity of glucose-conjugated LDH-A inhibitors designed for dual targeting of the Warburg effect ( elevated glucose uptake and glycolysis ) in cancer cells .	31 3
23255896-9	By contrast , the mechanism of antagonism may be due to mutual interference with the cell cycle in the H1975 cells .	
23255896-8	The molecular mechanism of this synergism is that RAF/MEK/ERK which are activated by gemcitabine are efficiently suppressed by simultaneously administered sorafenib .	
1470779-11	We report this histologically unusual HCC with an immunohistochemical study .	
1470779-10	The liver tumor was diagnosed as sarcomatoid HCC from these pathological findings .	
21280565-2	Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is a mediator of inflammatory pathway and may , therefore , contribute to carcinogenesis .	
21280565-3	There are several reports that suggest the association between CS and COX-2 associated risk to cancer .	
21280565-0	Cigarette smoke ( CS ) is a rich source of radicals , predisposing the cell to oxidative stress resulting in inflammation .	
21280565-1	Chronic inflammation is a recognized risk factor for carcinogenesis .	
21280565-6	Celecoxib ( 125 mg/kg body weight for 8 weeks ) administration to CS inhaling mice reduced the oxidative stress by decreasing the LPO levels and enhancing the GSH levels in comparison to the CS-exposed group .	a21 a2 a
21280565-7	CS exposure repressed the enzymatic antioxidant defense system , as evident from the decrease in catalase ( CAT ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activities .	a21 a2 a
21280565-4	In the present study , we examined the role of celecoxib ( a selective COX-2 inhibitor ) in modulating the oxidative stress caused by CS inhalation in mice .	
21280565-5	CS exposure for a period of 10 weeks caused oxidative stress in the pulmonary and hepatic tissues , as evident from the increase in lipid peroxidation levels ( LPO ) and decrease in reduced glutathione ( GSH ) levels .	a21 a2 a
21280565-8	Co-adminstration of celecoxib considerably reversed the changes in the enzymatic antioxidant defense system .	a21 a2 a
21280565-9	Histopathological studies of lungs showed that CS exposure induced alveolar wall destruction and air space enlargement .	
22485174-6	Both the DOK and H357 cell types exhibited predominantly mitochondrial accumulation of erythrosine , but the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential ( ΔΨ(m) ) studies showed that the H357 cells were far more resistant to the changes in ΔΨ(m) when compared to the DOK cells and this might be a factor in the apparent relative resistance of the H357 cells to PDT .	
22485174-7	Finally , cell death morphology and caspase activity analysis studies demonstrated the occurrence of extensive necrosis with high dose PDT in DOK cells , whereas apoptosis was observed at lower doses of PDT for both cell lines .	
22485174-4	The results showed that at 37 °C the uptake of erythrosine by both DOK and H357 cells increased in an erythrosine dose dependent manner .	
22485174-5	However , the percentage of cell killing observed following PDT differed between the 2 cell lines ; a maximum of of DOK cell killing was achieved as compared to killing for H357 cells .	
22485174-2	The drug uptake kinetics of erythrosine in malignant ( H357 ) and pre-malignant ( DOK ) oral epithelial cells and their susceptibility to erythrosine-based PDT was studied along with the determination of the subcellular localization of erythrosine .	
22485174-3	This was followed by initial investigations into the mechanism of cell killing induced following PDT involving both high and low concentrations of erythrosine .	
22485174-0	Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) involves the administration of a tumor localizing photosensitizing agent , which upon activation with light of an appropriate wavelength leads to the destruction of the tumor cells .	
22485174-1	The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of erythrosine as a photosensitizer for the PDT of oral malignancies .	
23251422-7	Both direct and inverted repeats stimulated excision of the constructs from the attB integration sites independently of HR , NHEJ , or SSA .	
22485174-8	For H357 cells , high dose PDT produced both apoptotic as well as necrotic responses .	
22485174-9	This is the first instance of erythrosine-based PDT's usage for cancer cell killing .	
23241438-4	Results showed that down-regulation of heparanase led to significant inhibition of invasive and proliferative potentials of A549 cells in vitro and in vivo .	11 1
23241438-5	Further research demonstrated that down-regulation of heparanase significantly inhibited the angiogenic potential of A549 cells , which might be the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of A549 cell proliferation in BALB/c nude mice in vivo .	7 71
23241438-6	These findings demonstrate that heparanase plays essential roles in regulating the invasion , proliferation , and angiogenesis of A549 cells .	11 71 1 7 9
23241438-0	Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix .	
23241438-1	The expression of heparanase was detected in a wide variety of human malignant tumors and closely associated with tumor invasion , metastasis , and angiogenesis .	
23241438-2	However , the specific roles of heparanase and its mechanisms of regulating the malignant potential of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells still remain unclear .	
23241438-3	In the present study , the expression of heparanase was down-regulated in NSCLC cell line by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide .	
20100593-1	The present study aimed to investigate the role of exogenously added glutathione ( GSH ) on ( 12)C-beam ( 287keV/mum ) and ( 7)Li-beam ( 60keV/mum ) induced chromosome aberration ( CA ) formation , particularly on exchange aberration formation .	
20100593-0	It is thought that high linear energy transfer ( LET ) radiation induces more complex DNA damage than low-LET particles , specifically clustered DNA damage that causes cells to repair DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) more slowly and leads to severe biological consequences .	
20100593-3	CHO cells were exposed to reduced GSH at a concentration of 2mM for 3h before radiation .	
20100593-2	In order to characterize the role of GSH in the joining of DNA DSBs , we induced DNA lesions with bleomycin ( Blem ) in conjunction with either high- or low-LET radiation ( X-rays ) since the chemistry of the free DNA ends created by Blem and X-rays is similar .	612 61 6
20100593-5	Our results show that the frequency of chromosomal aberration increases with increased LET .	61 6
20100593-4	Treatment with Blem ( 20mug/ml ) was carried out for 2h before the cells were exposed to radiation .	
20100593-7	An analysis of the first post-irradiation mitosis of exposed CHO cells shows that high-LET radiation induces more breaks than exchange-type aberrations and exogenous GSH has no influence on high-LET radiation-induced DNA damage .	61 6
20100593-6	Heavy ion exposed cells show a higher frequency of CA over time than do X-irradiated cells .	61 6
20100593-9	This could be attributed to differences in repair kinetics and qualitative differences in the DNA lesions induced by Blem and high-LET radiation .	62 6
20100593-8	The DNA lesions induced by low-LET radiation interact relatively strongly with Blem-induced lesions whereas interaction between Blem and high-LET radiations was poor .	
1399111-7	The K-rev revertant cell lines demonstrated a more differentiated phenotype and were less tumorigenic , invasive and metastatic in nude mice .	1
1399111-6	To further explore these correlations , the metastatic Calu-6 cell line was transfected with a K-rev-1 cDNA expression construct .	
1399111-5	TIMP-2 secretion , which exceeded MMP-2 secretion for all cell lines , did not correlate with metastatic potential .	1 12
1399111-4	MMP-9 and TIMP-1 secretions were comparatively low in all cell lines .	
1399111-3	We demonstrated that the Calu-6 and A549 cell lines with the highest metastatic , invasive and tumorigenic potential secreted the highest levels of MMP-2 .	1
1399111-2	In this report we have used sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassays to measure MMP-2 , MMP-9 , TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 levels in eight human lung-cancer cell lines which were characterized for biological behavior in nude mice .	
1399111-1	An abrogating effect of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 ) on metastases has also been noted .	
1399111-0	Numerous studies have reported a correlation between production of 72-kDa ( MMP-2 ) and 92-kDa ( MMP-9 ) type-IV collagenases/gelatinases and the metastatic potential of cancer cells .	
1399111-9	In conclusion , invasion and metastasis by lung-cancer cells requires not only enhanced MMP production , but also other less well-understood tumorigenic characteristics .	1
1399111-8	Nonetheless , the Calu-6 revertant cell lines secreted higher levels of MMP-2 than the parent cell line .	
12183433-8	Although , c-Myc has been reported to induce telomerase in MECs , Bmi-1 appeared to act independently of c-Myc binding sequences in the hTERT promoter .	
12183433-9	Deletion analysis of the Bmi-1 protein suggested that the RING finger , as well as a conserved helix-turn-helix-turn domain , were required for its ability to induce telomerase and immortalize MECs .	4 41
23276719-6	The invasion assay with DL-CGH revealed that inhibitation of Necl-5 expression in the BAC cells was associated with suppressed invasiveness .	11 1
12183433-0	The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that arise from mammary epithelial cells ( MECs ) .	
12183433-1	One of the key early events in tumorigenic transformation is the ability of cells to overcome replicative senescence .	
12183433-2	However , the precise genetic changes that are responsible for this event in MECs is largely unknown .	
12183433-3	Here , we report that Bmi-1 , originally identified as a c-Myc cooperating oncoprotein , can bypass senescence , extend the replicative life span , and immortalize MECs .	42 4 41
12183433-4	Furthermore , Bmi-1 was overexpressed in immortal MECs and several breast cancer cell lines .	
12183433-5	Overexpression of Bmi-1 in MECs led to activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) transcription and induction of telomerase activity .	
12183433-6	Telomerase induction by Bmi-1 was an early event in the extension of the replicative life span and immortalization .	4 41
12183433-7	Bmi-1 was not overexpressed in hTERT-immortalized MECs , suggesting that Bmi-1 functions upstream of hTERT .	4 41
12082607-10	This model will be useful for understanding mechanisms underlying vascular and angiogenic neoplasias , as well as for testing drugs designed to curtail aberrant EC growth .	7 71
12718610-9	These phenolics which have human exposure are known cancer chemopreventive agents and their action as inducers of apoptosis in tumor cells suggest their potential use in a strategy for cancer control .	8 81
12718610-8	Scoring of cells with apoptotic and non-apoptotic features showed positive correlation of apoptotic index with dose of phenolic , and fragmented DNA extracted free of genomic DNA displayed on gel electrophoresis a typical ladder pattern .	8 81
12718610-5	Resveratrol was cytotoxic only in leukemic cells , while capsaicin was marginally cytotoxic .	
12718610-4	On the other hand , yakuchinone B , although less active than curcumin , displayed cytotoxicity towards all four cell lines .	
12718610-7	When cells treated with phenolics were stained with propidium iodide and examined under a fluorescent microscope , characteristic apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were observed .	8 81
12718610-6	All these phenolics did not elicit any cytotoxic activity as judged by the above parameters towards lymphocytes purified from normal human blood .	
12718610-1	In cells grown in appropriate media the phenolics curcumin , yakuchinone B , resveratrol and capsaicin exhibited growth inhibition as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion .	
12718610-0	Investigation has been conducted to delineate the action of some phenolic compounds of natural origin in four human tumor cell lines : acute myeloblastic leukemia ( HL-60 ) , chronic myelogenic leukemia ( K-562 ) , breast adenocarcinoma ( MCF-7 ) and cervical epithelial carcinoma ( HeLa ) .	
12718610-3	Dose response studies indicated curcumin to be most cytotoxic towards HL-60 , K-562 and MCF-7 but did not show much activity in HeLa cells .	
12718610-2	It was evident from the results of the MTT reduction assay and [ (3)H]thymidine incorporation into nuclear DNA that the phenolics were cytotoxic and inhibited cell proliferation .	
23272179-8	The chemokine CXCL2 increased in the lamina propria and submucosal regions of the colons of the treated mice , together with the infiltration of neutrophils expressing CXCR2 , a specific receptor for CXCL2 .	
23272179-9	This process was followed by neoplastic transformation .	
22829774-6	These attributes will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of ALT positive human cancers .	
23272179-2	Macrophages contribute to the development of colitis-associated colon cancer ( CAC ) .	
23272179-3	However , the role of neutrophils is not well understood .	
23272179-0	Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a major form of chronic inflammation that can frequently progress to colon cancer .	
23272179-1	Several studies have demonstrated massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lamina propria and submucosa in the progression of UC-associated colon carcinogenesis .	
23272179-6	We observed that colorectal mucosal inflammation became increasingly severe with AOM and DSS treatment .	a a2
23272179-7	Macrophages infiltrated the lamina propria and submucosa , together with a marked increase in neutrophil infiltration .	
23272179-4	To better understand the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils ( TANs ) in the regulation of CAC , we used a mouse CAC model produced by administering azoxymethane ( AOM ) , followed by repeated dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) ingestion .	
23272179-5	This causes severe colonic inflammation and subsequent development of multiple tumors in mice colon .	
23006539-3	The objective of this study was to examine the critical role of LMWF during LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells .	
23006539-2	However , the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress effect of low molecular weight fucoidan ( LMWF ) is poorly understood in RAW264.7 cells .	
23006539-1	Fucoidan regulates MAPK activity in several cell lines .	
23006539-0	The suppression of MAPK and oxidative stress could be an important anti-inflammatory mechanism .	
23006539-7	Based on these findings , we suggest that LMWF might have great potential as an external pathogen prevention and intervention agent for inflammatory diseases .	a a2
23006539-6	This study also demonstrates that LMWF might block NO as well as the expression of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which subsequently inhibits the iNOS and COX-2 expression induced by LPS .	a21 a2 a
23006539-5	In this study , we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWF on LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages through the regulation of signalling pathways , including its effect on the attenuation of inflammatory cytokines , such as IL-1β , IL-1 and TNF-α , and the degradation of phosphorylated p38 MAPK , ERK1/2 and JNK .	a a2
23006539-4	To determine the potential role of LMWF , we analysed pro-inflammatory cytokine , transcription factor , inflammation-related and oxidative stress related protein expression in vitro during LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells .	
1617649-10	Stimulation of fibrosarcoma growth in vivo correlated with a corresponding bell-shaped drug-induced increase in DNA synthesis in vitro .	
1617649-11	While the median time to death from pulmonary metastases did not differ among groups given i.v. injections of melanoma cells , a significant ( P less than 0.01 ) stimulation of growth of s.c. injected melanoma was observed in mice receiving the antidepressants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )	1 12
12393401-4	However , when stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were coincubated with immature dendritic cells for 24 hours , this resulted in greater up-regulation of costimulatory molecules ( CD40 , CD80 , and CD86 ) on the surface of dendritic cells .	
12393401-5	Moreover , stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were more effective in stimulating dendritic cells to secrete interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) and in enhancing their immunostimulatory functions in mixed leukocyte reactions .	2 81 21 8
12393401-6	Furthermore , we demonstrated that immunization of mice with stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells induced the secretion of T helper-1 ( T(H)1 ) profile of cytokines by spleen cells .	2 21
12393401-7	Splenocytes from mice immunized with stressed apoptotic cells , but not nonstressed ones , were capable of lysing 12B1-D1 and the parental 12B1 line , but not a B-cell leukemia line , A20 .	
12393401-0	We have previously reported that stressed apoptotic tumor cells are more immunogenic in vivo than nonstressed ones .	
12393401-1	Using confocal microscopy we have confirmed our previous observation that heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 leukemia cells ( BCR-ABL(+) ) express HSP60 and HSP72 on their surface .	
12393401-2	To explore how the immune system distinguishes stressed from nonstressed apoptotic tumor cells , we analyzed the responses of dendritic cells to these 2 types of apoptotic cells .	
12393401-3	We found that nonstressed and heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were taken up by dendritic cells in a comparable fashion .	
12393401-8	Our data indicate that stressed apoptotic tumor cells are capable of providing the necessary danger signals , likely through increased surface expression of heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , resulting in activation/maturation of dendritic cells and , ultimately , the generation of potent antitumor T-cell responses .	8 2 81 21
23280187-10	To the best of our knowledge , these results suggest for the first time that novel crosstalk between β-catenin and the LKB1/AMPK pathway regulates the viability of HNSCC .	
23280187-11	This study thus presents new insights into our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in β-catenin silencing-induced cell death .	8
23151902-2	We showed that telomerase-immortalized Ben-Men-1 benign meningioma cells harbored a single nucleotide deletion in NF2 exon 7 and did not express the NF2 protein , merlin .	
23276719-7	In addition , Necl-5 knockdown inhibited the movement and proliferation of the BAC cells .	9
22829774-2	Recently , mutations in the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex and histone H3.3 were found to correlate with features of ALT in pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers , pediatric glioblastomas , and other tumors of the central nervous system , suggesting that these mutations might contribute to the activation of the ALT pathway in these cancers .	
1281278-5	These data are consistent with the hypothesis that T antigen causes human fibroblasts to become neoplastically transformed by successive rounds of chromosomal mutation and lineage evolution .	63 6
1281278-4	The most frequently observed aberrations were dicentric chromosomes , which were shown to be true dicentrics by examination by in situ hybridization with telomeric sequences .	
1281278-1	In some cases , the later aberrations have been reported to be reversible telomeric associations .	
1281278-0	In human fibroblasts , the expression of SV40 large T antigen is known to cause a variety of chromosomal aberrations and especially dicentric chromosomes .	
1281278-3	The data show that T antigen consistently produced chromosomal instability of both number and structure by an active process that began before transformation indicators were positive and continued throughout neoplastic progression .	6
1281278-2	We report here aberration and chromosome number studies of twenty-nine T antigen positive lineages , studied from their initiation by transfection of T antigen sequences into human diploid fibroblasts , until crisis or immortalization occurred or , in some cases until the lines became tumorigenic in nude mice .	4 41
22829774-3	We have taken a comprehensive approach to deciphering ALT by applying genomic , molecular biological , and cell biological approaches to a panel of 22 ALT cell lines , including cell lines derived in vitro .	
20967519-0	Accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that chronic inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in neoplastic development .	
20967519-1	The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative stress activities , and differential regulation of Nrf2-mediated genes by tea Chrysanthemum zawadskii ( CZ ) and licorice Glycyrrhiza uralensis ( LE ) extracts .	
20967519-2	The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress activities of hexane/ethanol extracts of CZ and LE were investigated using in vitro and in vivo approaches , including quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) and microarray .	
20967519-3	Additionally , the role of the transcriptional factor Nrf2 ( nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 ) signaling pathways was examined .	
20967519-4	Our results show that CZ and LE extracts exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activities by suppressing the mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers IL-1β , IL-6 , COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-stimulated murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells .	a a2
20967519-5	CZ and LE also significantly suppressed the NO production of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells .	a a2
20967519-6	Additionally , CZ and LE suppressed the NF-κB luciferase activity in human HT-29 colon cancer cells .	
20967519-7	Both extracts also showed strong Nrf2-mediated antioxidant/Phase II detoxifying enzymes induction .	a21 a2 a
20967519-8	CZ and LE induced NQO1 , Nrf2 , and UGT and antioxidant response element ( ARE)-luciferase activity in human hepatoma HepG2 C8 cells .	a21 a2 a
20967519-9	Using Nrf2 knockout [ Nrf2 ( -/-) ] and Nrf2 wild-type ( +/+ ) mice , LE and CZ showed Nrf2-dependent transactivation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant and phase II detoxifying genes .	a21 a2 a
21739465-2	We have recently knocked out AR gene in smooth muscle cells and found the reduced luminal infolding and IGF-1 production in the mouse prostate .	
21739465-3	However , AR roles of stromal fibroblasts in prostate development remain unclear .	
21739465-4	METHODS To further probe the stromal fibroblast AR roles in prostate development , we generated tissue-selective knockout mice with the AR gene deleted in stromal fibroblasts ( FSP-ARKO ) .	
21739465-5	We also used primary culture stromal cells to confirm the in vivo data and investigate mechanisms related to prostate development .	
21739465-6	RESULTS The results showed cellular alterations in the FSP-ARKO mouse prostate with decreased epithelial proliferation , increased apoptosis , and decreased collagen composition .	8 81
21739465-7	Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that FSP-ARKO mice have defects in the expression of prostate stromal growth factors .	9 92
22851530-4	PRISM uses a split-alignment approach informed by the mapping of paired-end reads , hence enabling breakpoint identification of multiple SV types , including arbitrary-sized inversions , deletions and tandem duplications .	
20593952-0	OBJECTIVE The study was undertaken to document and highlight the shortcomings of histopathology reporting of breast carcinoma in Pakistan so that improvements can be recommended and a standardized protocol devised .	
20593952-1	METHODS This was a descriptive cross sectional study and was conducted at Histopathology Department , Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , Rawalpindi from 1st January 2008 to 31st October 2008 .	
20593952-2	Fifty consecutive breast carcinoma reports received for review from different laboratories were analyzed for documentation of patients age , sex , type of procedure/specimen , specimen size , tumour size , invasive tumour type , invasive tumour grade , comment on excision margins , extent of lymph node involvement , insitu component , lymphovascular invasion , necrosis , skin involvement and tabular format .	
20593952-3	Frequencies and percentages were calculated for presence of these above mentioned variables in different reports , keeping in mind the possible information that could be obtained from a particular sample .	
20593952-4	RESULTS It was found that the variable least mentioned in the reports was in situ component commented upon in only 23.2% of reports .	
20593952-5	Necrosis was mentioned in 35% of reports .	83 8
20593952-6	Tabular format was found in 36% of reports only .	
20593952-7	CONCLUSION Marked deficiencies are seen in histopathology reports for breast carcinoma due to the lack of any standardized reporting system .	
20593952-8	Separate checklist formats for trucut biopsies , lumpectomies and mastectomies should be introduced to ensure uniform reporting .	
23151902-1	To evaluate potential medical therapies for these tumors , we have established a quantifiable orthotopic model for NF2-deficient meningiomas .	
23111389-9	Our results suggest that the inhibition of miR-93 function may be a feasible approach to repress tumor metastasis .	
23111389-8	These findings demonstrated that miR-93 promoted tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by suppressing LATS2 expression .	
11970855-1	However , its role in solid leukemia tumor development is essentially unknown .	
11970855-0	The active involvement of physical exercise in the evolution of a variety of cancers is well documented .	
11970855-3	The tumor size of the continuously exercising group was of that of control and exercise-terminated animals 18 days after the transplantation .	
11970855-2	Solid leukemia tumor cells were transplanted into 21 hybrid BDF1 control mice , exercise-trained mice that did not exercise during leukemia and exercise-trained mice that exercised during leukemia .	
11970855-5	The level of carbonylated proteins was smaller in tumors of continuously exercising animals .	
11970855-4	The activity of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of lipid peroxidation and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were not different in the tumors of the three groups .	
11970855-7	On the other hand , the protooncogene Ras and I-kappaB proteins were present in higher concentrations in tumors of continuously exercising rats .	
11970855-6	The mutant form of cell regulatory protein p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor were present in similar amounts in the tumor cells of each group .	
11970855-9	The selective alteration of regulatory proteins might play a role in the beneficial effects of exercise during leukemia .	
11970855-8	The present data suggest that exercise during leukemia attenuates the development of tumors in mice .	
22307089-0	Atherosclerosis ( As ) is now widely appreciated to represent a chronic inflammatory reaction of the vascular wall in response to dyslipidemia and endothelial distress involving the inflammatory recruitment of leukocytes and the activation of resident vascular cells .	
22307089-1	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are a group of endogenous , small ( nucleotides in length ) non-coding RNA molecules , which function specifically by base pairing with mRNA of genes , thereby induce translation repressions of the genes within metazoan cells .	
22307089-2	Recently , the function of miR-27 , one of the miRNAs , in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis has been identified .	
22307089-3	In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that miR-27 may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for atherosclerosis .	
22307089-4	More recently , studies have identified important roles for miR-27 in angiogenesis , adipogenesis , inflammation , lipid metabolism , oxidative stress , insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes , etc .	
22307089-5	In this review , we focus on the role of miR-27 in the development of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques , potential as a disease biomarker and novel therapeutic target in atherosclerosis .	
23151902-6	Consistently , AR-42 substantially decreased the levels of cyclin D1 , E , and A , and PCNA in meningeal cells while significantly reducing the expression of cyclin B , important for progression through G2 , in Ben-Men-1 cells .	
20214814-7	The impairments do not seem to be tumor-specific , since similar results were obtained in subjects with chronic pancreatitis .	
20214814-6	Our results prove that solid pancreatic tumors , including PDAC , systemically affect blood DCs .	
20214814-5	Levels of these inflammatory factors were in part restored in PDAC after tumor resection , whereas the levels of DCs were impaired in the majority of these patients approximately 12 weeks after tumor removal .	a1 a2 a
20214814-4	We found elevated levels of PGE2 and CXCL8 in subjects with PDAC , and chronic pancreatitis .	
20214814-3	RESULTS All groups examined , including PDAC , had decreased levels of myeloid DCs ( MDC ) and plasmacytoid DCs ( PDC ) and enhanced apoptosis in these cells as compared to controls .	
20214814-2	METHODS We examined the systemic influence ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) exerted on levels of peripheral blood DCs and inflammatory mediators in comparison to the effects exerted by other pancreatic tumors , chronic pancreatitis , and age-matched controls .	
20214814-1	Ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) , the most common pancreatic cancer , is recognized as a very aggressive cancer type with a mortality that almost matches the rate of incidence .	
20214814-0	BACKGROUND Dendritic cells ( DCs ) isolated from tumor bearing animals or from individuals with solid tumors display functional abnormalities and the DC impairment has emerged as one mechanism for tumor evasion from the control of the immune system .	
20214814-9	CONCLUSIONS Our findings points to the involvement of inflammation in the destruction of the blood MDCs and PDCs .	a a2
19836430-10	Together , these results suggest that TNFalpha induced oxidative stress affects Akt activation to regulate actin organization and growth of glioma cells .	a21 a2 a
20448329-7	No CDC4/FBXW7 mutations were found and loss of CDC4/FBXW7 did not correlate with ploidy status .	63 6
20448329-6	Loss of expression was frequent in both EOGC and conventional gastric cancers .	63 6
20448329-5	RESULTS Loss of heterozygosity of CDC4/FBXW7 occurred in 32% of EOGCs , and correlated with loss of expression in 26% .	63 6
20448329-4	Sequence analysis of CDC4/FBXW7 was carried out on gastric carcinoma cell lines and xenografts .	
20448329-3	Ploidy analysis was carried out on 39 EOGCs and immunohistochemistry of CDC4/FBXW7 and its substrates c-myc , c-jun , Notch and cyclin E was performed on 204 gastric carcinomas using tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) .	
20448329-2	METHODS We assessed the role of CDC4/FBXW7 in gastric cancer , through loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) on 47 flow-sorted gastric carcinomas including early-onset gastric cancers ( EOGC ) and xenografted conventional gastric carcinomas .	
20448329-1	Mutations in colonic adenomas , and the frequent losses on 4q described in gastric cancer prompt speculation about the role of CDC4/FBXW7 in gastric carcinogenesis .	
20448329-0	BACKGROUND CDC4/FBXW7 , encoding a ubiquitin ligase , maps to 4q32 and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene and therapeutic target in many tumor types .	
20448329-9	CONCLUSION Loss of CDC4/FBXW7 appears to play a role in both EOGC and conventional gastric carcinogenesis , and c-myc overexpression is likely to be an important oncogenic consequence of CDC4/FBXW7 loss .	
20448329-8	There was a significant correlation between loss of CDC4/FBXW7 expression and upregulation of c-myc .	63 6
1596891-5	Our findings suggest that proliferation of human renal carcinoma cells may be regulated by endogenously produced TGF-alpha and that this regulatory pathway can be interrupted using antibody to its receptor , EGF-R .	9 93 92
1596891-4	In addition , incubation of cells with monoclonal antibody 225 significantly elevated the levels of excreted TGF-alpha species in the culture medium .	9 92
22201186-1	However , further investigations are needed to identify GSK3-dependent mechanisms involved in the control of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival .	
22201186-0	Recent evidences suggest that the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK3 ) contributes to the tumorigenic potential of pancreatic cancer cells through modulation of cell proliferation and survival .	
1596891-1	In the studies presented here , we have examined this hypothesis using two human renal carcinoma cell lines , SKRC-4 and SKRC-29 .	
1596891-0	Findings of increased numbers of epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGF-R ) and increased expression of transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF-alpha ) in surgical specimens of human renal cell carcinoma have led to the proposal that growth of these tumors may be regulated by TGF-alpha in an autocrine manner .	
1596891-3	Treatment of cells with TGF-alpha enhanced the levels of expression of EGF-R mRNA and TGF-alpha mRNA .	9 93 92
1596891-2	We demonstrated that both SKRC-4 and SKRC-29 cells were growth stimulated by greater than 35% when cultured in the presence of TGF-alpha or EGF and were inhibited by 29% to 46% if cultured in the presence of anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody 225 .	9 92
23251664-12	Furthermore , it was suggested that the potent neutralizing activity of Y-142 was derived from its recognition of R142 and Y123 and its high affinity to HB-EGF .	
23251664-13	Y-142 has a potent HB-EGF neutralizing activity that modulates multiple biological activities of HB-EGF including cancer cell proliferation and angiogenic activities .	9 7
22387176-9	These data support the hypothesis that PPARδ activation can modulate radiation-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in microglia .	a21 a2 a
22387176-8	PPARδ inhibited NF-κB via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit and prevented activation of the PKCα/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway by inhibiting the radiation-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation .	a21 a2 a
23251664-14	Y-142 may have a potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HB-EGF-dependent cancers .	
22387176-3	Microglia are key mediators of neuroinflammation .	
22387176-2	Although the exact mechanisms underlying radiation-induced late effects remain unclear , oxidative stress and inflammation are thought to play a critical role .	
22387176-1	Radiation-induced normal tissue injury , including progressive cognitive impairment , however , can significantly affect the well-being of the approximately 200,000 patients who receive these treatments each year in the United States .	
22387176-0	Partial or whole-brain irradiation is often required to treat both primary and metastatic brain cancer .	
22387176-7	This occurred , in part , through PPARδ-mediated modulation of stress-activated kinases and proinflammatory transcription factors .	a a2
22387176-6	Incubating BV-2 murine microglial cells with the PPARδ agonist L-165041 prevented the radiation-induced increase in : ( i ) intracellular reactive oxygen species generation , ( ii ) Cox-2 and MCP-1 expression , and ( iii ) IL-1β and TNF-α message levels .	a21 a2 a
22387176-5	Thus , we hypothesized that PPARδ activation would modulate the radiation-induced inflammatory response in microglia .	
22387176-4	Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) δ has been shown to be a potent regulator of anti-inflammatory responses .	
12462603-1	After separation by gradient elution , adducts were analyzed by negative electrospray mass spectrometry , enabling to evidence and localize the modifications in the oligonucleotide sequence .	
12462603-0	Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry has been used for the detection and the structural characterization of T-rich model oligonucleotides covalently modified by estradiol-2,3-quinone .	
12462603-3	Isomeric adducts were differentiated using tandem mass spectrometry , and energy resolved mass spectrometry allowed to underline differences in the behavior of the adducts towards collisional excitation into an ion trap device .	61 611 6
12462603-2	Modifications by one molecule of estrogen were evidenced on purines ( A , G ) whereas no reaction was observed on pyrimidic bases ( T ) .	
22843031-4	In addition , a reduction in mitochondrial complexI activity ( and a significant increase in LDH activity , as well as lactate production were observed in the cells exposed to metformin .	
22843031-5	Interestingly , a severe depletion in ATP , increased olive tail moment and the delayed disappearance of γ-H2AX expression were detected in the hepatoma cells treated by metformin plus IR .	
22843031-6	These findings show that the combination of a low concentration of metformin and IR results in the considerable enhancement of cytotoxic effects in human hepatoma cell lines , leading to decreased DNA repair by reducing ATP production .	
22843031-7	The data provided in this study may elucidate the remarkable efficiency of this combination treatment and suggest that metformin may be used as a potential adjunct to the radiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma .	
24398380-3	Changes to the triazolo or pyridazinone rings were not favoured , but limited-size substitutions on the aryl ring provided modest increases in potency against the enzyme .	
11742853-1	Zucker obese rats have a so-called fatty mutation in the leptin receptor gene and express a dysfunctional protein .	
22894905-16	However , HIF1α-driven aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells inhibits tumor growth .	
22894905-17	Finally , HIF2α activation in cancer cells induces the expression of known pro-oncogenic molecules and promotes the mitochondrial activity of cancer cells .	
22894905-14	Conversely , HIF2α is a tumor promoter in cancer cells .	
22894905-15	Mechanistically , HIF1α-driven aerobic glycolysis in stromal cells supports cancer cell growth via the paracrine production of nutrients ( such as L-lactate ) that can " feed " cancer cells .	
22894905-12	We conclude that the role(s) of HIF1α and HIF2α in tumorigenesis are compartment-specific .	
22894905-13	HIF1α acts as a tumor promoter in stromal cells but as a tumor suppressor in cancer cells .	
22894905-10	Interestingly , HIF2α activation in MDA-MB-231 cells induced a significant in tumor mass and volume .	
22894905-11	Analysis of mitochondrial activity in these tumor xenografts using COX ( cytochrome C oxidase ) staining demonstrated elevated mitochondrial oxidative metabolism ( OXPHOS ) in HIF2α-tumors .	
23264896-1	Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4)-NFκB signaling axis is associated with inflammation .	
23204518-10	While functional mutation of the RGD motif in OPN largely abolished these functions , OPN(RAA)-R regained significant cell binding and signaling function , suggesting that the SVVYGLR motif in OPN-R may substitute for the RGD-motif if the latter becomes inaccessible .	
22438059-11	In summary , human MCs express multiple CADM1 isoforms which exhibit differential regulation of survival and homotypic adhesion .	
23204518-11	OPN cleavage contributes to GBM development by allowing more cells to bind in niches in which they acquire anti-apoptotic properties .	
23219753-7	Conversely , the suppression of Rap-1A expression using Rap-1A-mediated siRNA was sufficient to decrease cell motility .	
22876840-12	Our analysis showed that miR-196a suppressed the expression of HOXA5 both at the mRNA and protein levels , and luciferase assays confirmed that miR-196a directly bound to the 3'untranslated region of HOXA5 .	
22876840-13	Knockdown of HOXA5 expression in A549 cells using RNAi was shown to promote NSCLC cell proliferation , migration and invasion .	
22876840-10	Higher expression of miR-196a in NSCLC tissues was associated with a higher clinical stage , and also correlated with NSCLC lymph-node metastasis .	
22876840-11	In vitro functional assays demonstrated that modulation of miR-196a expression affected NSCLC cell proliferation , migration and invasion .	
22876840-16	Thus , miR-196a may represent a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC intervention .	
22876840-14	Finally , we observed an inverse correlation between HOXA5 and miR-196a expression in NSCLC tissues .	
22876840-15	CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that miR-196a is significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues , and regulates NSCLC cell proliferation , migration and invasion , partially via the down-regulation of HOXA5 .	
23137061-2	Emerging theory indicates that cancer may be a disease of stem cells ( SCs ) and that there are abundant active SCs during early life .	
23137061-3	Therefore , we hypothesized that inorganic arsenic targets SCs , or partially differentiated progenitor cells ( PCs ) , for oncogenic transformation .	
23137061-0	Inorganic arsenic in the drinking water is a multisite human carcinogen that potentially targets the kidney .	
23137061-1	Recent evidence also indicates that developmental arsenic exposure impacts renal carcinogenesis in humans and mice .	
23137061-6	Arsenic exposure by 10 weeks and after also induced marked and sustained increases in colony formation , indicative of the loss of contact inhibition , and increased invasiveness , both cancer cell characteristics .	11 1 5 52
23137061-7	Compared to the passage-matched control , chronic arsenic exposure caused exposure-duration dependent increases in secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity , Cox-2 expression , and more rapid proliferation ( all >2-fold ) , characteristics typical of cancer cells .	9 a2 a
23137061-4	Thus , a rat kidney SC/PC cell line , RIMM-18 , was chronically exposed to low-level arsenite ( 500 nM ) for up to 28 weeks .	
23137061-5	Multiple markers of acquired cancer phenotype were assessed biweekly during arsenic exposure , including secreted matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , proliferation rate , colony formation in soft agar , and cellular invasiveness .	
22870946-5	For the mutant structure , histogram analysis of pairwise distances between residues in domains 1 and 2 ( E291-Q460 , K210-R464 and R467-T212 ) showed that separation between the two domains was reduced by and the standard deviation by Root mean square fluctuation ( RMSF ) analysis demonstrated that residues in close proximity to residue 324 have at least 30% RMSF value reductions in the mutant structure .	
22870946-4	Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for both wild type and the T324A mutant apo structures to compare their differences .	
22870946-7	We also demonstrated that the T324A mutation established a new atomic interaction with V331 , revealing that an atomic interaction cascade from T324 to residues in domains 1 and 2 controls the flexibility of the ATP-binding cleft .	
22870946-6	Solvent RMSF analysis showed that more water molecules were trapped near D290 and H293 in domain 1 to form an extensive interaction network constraining cleft opening .	
22870946-1	Understanding the regulation mechanism of ATP binding will facilitate targeting of the ATP-binding site for potential therapeutic development for hepatitis C. T324 , an amino acid residue connecting domains 1 and 2 of NS3 helicase , has been suggested as part of a flexible hinge for opening of the ATP-binding cleft , although the detailed mechanism remains largely unclear .	
22870946-0	Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) NS3 helicase couples adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) binding and hydrolysis to polynucleotide unwinding .	
22870946-3	A mutant model , T324A , of the NS3 helicase apo structure was created and energy was minimized .	
22870946-2	We used computational simulation to examine the mutational effect of T324 on the dynamics of the ATP-binding site .	
23219753-6	Functionally , overexpressed Rap-1A could promote oral cancer cell migration and invasion by Transwell chambers and wound healing assay .	11 1
20501860-9	The outcome of this study may benefit the development of resveratrol in the prevention and intervention of human HCC .	
20501860-8	Results of the present investigation provide evidence that attenuation of oxidative stress and suppression of inflammatory response mediated by Nrf2 could be implicated , at least in part , in the chemopreventive effects of this dietary agent against chemically induced hepatic tumorigenesis in rats .	
20501860-5	Elevated expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and 3-nitrotyrosine were noticed in the livers of the same animals .	
20501860-4	There was a significant increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in carcinogen control animals compared with their normal counterparts at the end of the study ( 20 weeks ) .	a21 a2 a
20501860-7	Resveratrol also elevated the protein and mRNA expression of hepatic nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) .	
20501860-6	Dietary resveratrol ( 50-300 mg/kg ) administered throughout the study reversed all the aforementioned markers in a dose-responsive fashion in rats challenged with DENA .	
20501860-1	In the absence of a proven effective therapy for HCC , novel chemopreventive strategies are urgently needed to lower the current morbidity and mortality of HCC .	
20501860-0	Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , one of the most frequent and deadliest cancers , has been increasing considerably in the United States .	
20501860-3	In the present study , we have examined the underlying mechanisms of resveratrol chemoprevention of hepatocarcinogenesis by investigating the effects of resveratrol on oxidative damage and inflammatory markers during DENA-initiated rat liver carcinogenesis .	
20501860-2	Recently , we have reported that resveratrol , a compound present in grapes and red wine , significantly prevents diethylnitrosamine ( DENA)-induced liver tumorigenesis in rats , although the mechanism of action is not completely understood .	
23151902-10	Importantly , AR-42-treated tumors showed minimal regrowth when xenograft-bearing mice were switched to normal diet .	
23151902-11	Together , these results suggest that AR-42 is a potential therapy for meningiomas .	
23151902-12	The differential effect of AR-42 on cell-cycle progression of normal meningeal and meningioma cells may have implications for why AR-42 is well-tolerated while it potently inhibits tumor growth .	
20975834-1	Adaptation of a redox-sensitive cysteinyl thiol in PTEN for signal transduction by hydrogen peroxide may have superimposed a vulnerability to other mediators of oxidative stress and inflammation , especially reactive carbonyl species , which are commonly occurring by-products of arachidonic acid peroxidation .	
20975834-0	PTEN , a phosphoinositide-3-phosphatase , serves dual roles as a tumor suppressor and regulator of cellular anabolic/catabolic metabolism .	
20975834-3	Alkylation of PTEN by α,β-enals/enones and interference with its restraint of cellular PKB/Akt signaling may accentuate hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders associated with chronic inflammation , oxidative stress , or aging .	a21 a2 a
20975834-2	Using MCF7 and HEK-293 cells , we report that several reactive aldehydes and ketones , e.g. electrophilic α,β-enals ( acrolein , 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal ) and α,β-enones ( prostaglandin A(2) , Δ12-prostaglandin J(2) and 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J(2) ) covalently modify and inactivate cellular PTEN , with ensuing activation of PKB/Akt kinase ; phosphorylation of Akt substrates ; increased cell proliferation ; and increased nuclear β-catenin signaling .	
12664617-2	This study is to investigate the possible roles of both isoforms in the proliferation of colon carcinoma cells .	
12664617-3	A human colon carcinoma cell line , COLO 320DM , was transfected with an eukaryotic expression vector ( pEF-BOS ) carrying cDNA of either COX-1 or COX-2 .	
12664617-0	Recent epidemiological and experimental investigations suggest a close relationship between cyclooxygenase ( COX ) and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer .	
12664617-1	There are two isoforms , COX-1 and COX-2 , which differ in physiological functions and distribution .	
12664617-6	The stimulated growth of the COX-expressing cells was confirmed by the increased DNA synthesis as assessed by [ 3H]thymidine incorporation .	
12664617-7	Furthermore , expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) was markedly increased in the COX-expressing cells as examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) .	9 93
12664617-4	Both COX-1 and COX-2-expressing cells exhibited a similar enzyme activity , 8-10 nmol/10 min/mg of protein .	
12664617-5	Growth rates of both COX-expressing cells were increased by about 2 fold as compared with mock-transfected cells .	
23251422-8	With episomal constructs , direct and inverted repeats triggered DNA instability by activating nucleolytic activity , and absence of the DSB repair pathways ( in the order NHEJ>HR>SSA ) exacerbated this instability .	
20188144-9	GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE These findings suggest that the hepatocyte may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of fibrosis associated with NAFLD .	
12664617-8	A COX inhibitor , indomethacin , suppressed the stimulated growth , increased DNA synthesis and induction of epidermal growth factor receptor in the COX-1 and COX-2-transfected cells .	91 93 9
12664617-9	These results suggest that not only COX-2 but COX-1 is involved in the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cells through the induction of EGFR .	9 93
1540219-1	Eighty individuals ( 55.2% ) had an activity lower than 10 pmol/min/10(6) lymphocytes and were classified as GST class Mu deficient .	
23264896-5	Inflammation was induced by challenging the colon cancer SW480 cells with Escherichia coli LPS .	a a2
20817674-10	CONCLUSION These results indicate that cisplatin induces acute kidney injury by regulation of p53-dependent renal tubular apoptosis and that luteolin ameliorates the cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity through down-regulation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in the kidney .	
23255900-7	Thus , immunotherapy with IL-21 in combination with sPD-1 was found to induce a more efficacious antitumor immune response , which may have potential clinical implications .	2 21
22884369-1	In neuronal tissues , binding to prion protein was required for STIP1 to activate the ERK ( extracellular-regulated MAP kinase ) signaling pathways .	
22884369-0	Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 ( STIP1 ) , a cochaperone that organizes other chaperones , heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , was recently shown to be secreted by human ovarian cancer cells .	
23255900-5	Combined treatment with IL-21 and sPD-1 enhanced the antitumor immune response compared with that induced by IL-21 alone .	2 21
22778940-6	Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of casistics of ESRC treated with total mesorectal excision with the aim of identifying risk factors for nodal involvement .	
23264896-4	We first characterized this peptide for its ability to bind the TLR4 ligand-LPS and for physico-chemical characteristics .	
22884369-2	However , we report that STIP1 binding to a bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor , ALK2 ( activin A receptor , type II-like kinase 2 ) , was necessary and sufficient to stimulate proliferation of ovarian cancer cells .	9 93
23258740-1	Therefore , the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes leading to malignant phenotype , and , consequently is an attractive target .	
22884369-5	Although animal studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms in vivo , our results may pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer .	
19881551-13	Such an important epigenetic link between glycolysis and carcinogenesis partly explains the Warburg effect .	31 3
19881551-12	Promoter methylation of FBP1 can be used as a new biomarker for prognosis prediction of gastric cancer .	
19881551-11	In summary , we found that NF-kappaB functions downstream of Ras to promote epigenetic downregulation of FBP1 .	
19881551-10	Notably , Cox regression analysis revealed FBP1 promoter methylation as an independent prognosis predicator for gastric cancer ( hazard ratio : 3.60 , P=0.010 ) .	
24260485-0	In normal tissues , strict control of tissue size is achieved by regulating cell numbers .	
24260485-1	The mechanism that controls total cell number is known as contact inhibition of growth and it depends on the NF2/Merlin pathway .	
23258740-7	While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G2 growth arrest and autophagy , it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 PCa cells .	82 81 8
12734064-0	We examined the influence of the level of dietary protein or vitamin E ( VE ) on oxidative damage to DNA , lipids , and protein in the liver after total body irradiation ( TBI ) with X-rays at 1 or 4 Gy .	
12734064-1	Levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances , and protein carbonyls in the liver did not differ among the groups that did not receive TBI .	a21 a2 a
12734064-2	However , oxidative damage to lipids and protein was increased by TBI only in the 1% protein group .	a21 a2 a
12734064-3	DNA damage , lipid peroxidation , or protein oxidation in the liver was increased by TBI in a dose-dependent manner , and the damage was consistently higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group .	a21 63 a 6 a2
12734064-4	In the 1% protein group , a greater decrease in relative spleen weight by TBI was also observed .	
12734064-5	Concentrations of antioxidants ( vitamins C and E and glutathione ) in the liver were lower and the concentration of nonheme iron in the liver was higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group .	
12734064-6	Mice fed a 1% protein diet became susceptible to TBI-induced oxidative damage , and decreases in antioxidant levels and an increase in iron level were involved in the mechanism of this susceptibility .	a21 a2 a
12734064-7	These results suggest that dietary VE and protein can prevent oxidative damage to DNA , lipid , and protein in mice subjected to TBI .	a a21 61 a2 6
12734064-8	Consumption of a VE-free diet significantly increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in DNA from mice fed the 1% protein diet with TBI , but such changes were not detected in DNA from mice fed the 20% protein diet .	a a21 61 a2 6
22264502-3	After PlncRNA-1 was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) .	
1470779-9	Low molecular cytokeratin , which is always found in HCCs , was seen in spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cells .	
1470779-8	In addition , some necrotic ghost cells , probably hepatocellular carcinoma , were also noted .	83 8
22264502-6	Silencing of PlncRNA-1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in CaP cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-AI .	8 81
22264502-7	Mechanistically , PlncRNA-1 suppression by siRNA resulted in a decrease of androgen receptor ( AR ) mRNA , protein and AR downstream target .	9 93
22264502-4	After PlncRNA-1 and AR was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , real-time q-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and AR .	
22264502-5	RESULTS : We showed that expression PlncRNA-1 , was significantly higher in CaP cells relative to normal prostate epithelial cells , as well as higher in human CaPs compared with normal tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) .	
23266555-2	We recently demonstrated that Orai3 channels are over-expressed in breast cancer ( BC ) biopsies , and involved specifically in proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells .	
23258740-9	Importantly , the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in PC3 xenografts .	
23264896-9	We found that the SPA4 peptide does not bind to LPS .	11 1
20817674-3	The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of luteolin on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and the molecular mechanism .	
23430509-7	Heterotransplantation to nude mice produced tumors that reflected the original .	
23430509-6	We observed that phosphorylated Akt protein was overexpressed in TU-OC-1 cells by western blot analysis .	
23430509-5	Mutational analysis revealed that TU-OC-1 cells harbored a PIK3CA mutation at codon 542 ( E542K ) in exon 9 , which is a mutation hot spot on this gene .	63 6
23430509-4	The respective IC50 values of cisplatin and paclitaxel were 12.2μM and 58.3nM .	
23430509-3	A low rate of proliferation was observed , similar to other CCC cell lines tested ( OVTOKO , RMG-I , and OVAS ) , and the doubling time was 38.4h .	
23430509-2	The chromosome numbers ranged from 64 to 90 .	
23430509-1	The cells showed a polygonal-shaped morphology and grew in monolayers without contact inhibition and were arranged like a jigsaw puzzle .	
23430509-0	A new cell line of human ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma ( CCC ) , TU-OC-1 , was established and characterized .	
23264896-8	Simultaneously , the effects on LPS-induced cell migration and invasion were determined .	
23027128-12	Our data reveal important roles for a PTK6-FAK-AKT signaling axis in promoting anchorage-independent cell survival .	
23027128-10	In a conditional Pten knockout murine prostate cancer model , we identify prostate epithelial cells with enhanced activation of endogenous PTK6 and FAK at the plasma membrane .	
23027128-11	Knockdown of PTK6 in the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line disrupts FAK and AKT activation and promotes anoikis , which can be rescued by exogenous expression of FAK .	
23255900-2	In the current study , we investigated IL-21 alone and in combination with soluble PD-1 ( sPD-1 ) for the treatment of experimental H22 murine hepatocarcinoma .	
22446839-3	The present study demonstrated that M30 and HLA20 significantly decreased intracellular iron content and reduced ferritin expression levels in iron-loaded hepatoma Hep3B cells .	
22446839-2	Here , we examined the hepatic regulatory effects of these novel compounds using two experimental approaches : chelation activity and glucose metabolism parameters .	
22446839-1	Thus , we have recently synthesized multifunctional non-toxic , brain permeable iron chelating compounds , M30 and HLA20 , possessing the neuroprotective N-propargyl moiety of the anti-Parkinsonian drug , monoamine oxidase ( MAO)-B inhibitor , rasagiline and the antioxidant-iron chelating moiety of an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative of the iron chelator , VK28 .	
22446839-0	Iron accumulation and iron-related oxidative stress are involved in several pathological conditions and provide a rationale for the development of iron chelators as novel promising therapeutic strategies .	
22446839-7	Such effects can have therapeutic significance in conditions with abnormal local or systemic iron metabolism , including neurological diseases .	
22446839-6	The results clearly indicate that the novel multifunctional drugs , especially M30 , display significant capacity of chelating intracellular iron and regulating glucose metabolism parameters .	
22446839-5	In vivo studies demonstrated that M30 administration ( 1 mg/kg , P.O. three times a week ) reduced hepatic ferritin levels ; increased hepatic insulin receptor and glucose transporter-1 levels and improved glucose tolerance in C57BL/6 mice and in a mouse model of type-2 diabetes , the ob/ob ( leptin(-/-) ) .	
22446839-4	In electron microscopy analysis , M30 was shown to reduce the electron-dense deposits of siderosomes by % , as well as down-regulate cytosolic ferritin particles observed in iron-overloaded cells .	
20204879-4	The use of random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis for the analysis of DSB levels is described .	612 61 6
23513490-7	The presence of polyuria and polydipsia in an oncologic patient should alert the physician for diabetes insipidus and , if confirmed , an imaging procedure of the pituitary gland is mandatory .	
22888341-6	Results .	
20204879-2	The level of DSBs positively correlates with the activities of homologous and nonhomologous DNA repair pathways , which in turn inversely correlate with methylation levels and chromatin structure .	612 62 61 6
12441637-8	There is no correlation between the DNA repair capacity estimated on the basis of preterminal exposures to BLM and DEB and the DNA repair capacity estimated on the basis of the adaptive response to DEB .	62 6
22888341-8	The intratumoral microvessel density was higher in normal saline group than in N-desulfated heparin group ( P < 0.05). bFGF expression in gastric tissue was inhibited by N-desulfated heparin ( P < 0.05 ) .	
23243586-6	Moreover , upon stimulation with interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , an inducer of the M2 phenotype , well established M2 markers such as Fizz-1 , Ym1 and arginase-1 were upregulated in Arf(-/-) as compared with wild type macrophages .	
12579213-11	It is thought that HSP70 immunoreactivity , besides invasion depth , lymph node metastasis , vascular invasion , tumor size and inflammatory reaction against the tumor , is important in prognosis and associated with advanced stage .	1 a
12579213-10	Defining prognostic factors of gastric carcinomas is of importance to clinicians .	
24260485-4	Accordingly , inhibition of endogenous CD43 expression by RNA interference in lung , cervix and colon human cancer cells impaired tumor growth in vivo .	
23142370-8	The overall results suggest that lycopodine is a promising candidate suitable for therapeutic use as an anti-cancer drug .	
12658828-14	Long term follow up ( 5 years ) assessment shows similar outcome compared with conventional surgery .	
12658828-11	Two port site metastasis ( 2.6% ) were seen in locally advanced carcinoma .	1 12
12658828-10	The rate of late complications was 5.4% .	
12658828-13	CONCLUSION Laparoscopic colorectal resection for cancer can be performed safely , with a low morbidity and rare late complications .	
12658828-12	Recurrence rate at 5 years was 0% for Dukes A , 20% for Dukes B , 39.2% for Dukes C. Survival rate at 5 years was 100% for Dukes A , 80% for Dukes B , and 60.7% for Dukes C. These results are similar to those of conventional open surgery .	
23274911-6	These data demonstrate for the first time the important role that N-Ras plays in colorectal cancer .	
23274911-4	As a result , inhibition of MEK selectively induces apoptosis in autochthonous colonic tumors expressing mutant N-Ras .	8 81
23274911-5	The translational significance of this finding is highlighted by our observation that NRAS mutation correlates with a less favorable clinical outcome for colorectal cancer patients .	63 6
23274911-2	Using genetically engineered mice , we find that mutant N-Ras strongly promotes tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation .	
23274911-3	The pro-tumorigenic nature of mutant N-Ras is related to its anti-apoptotic function , which is mediated by activation of a non-canonical MAPK pathway that signals through Stat3 .	8 81
23274911-0	N-Ras is one member of a family of oncoproteins that are commonly mutated in cancer .	
23274911-1	Activating mutations in N-Ras occur in a subset of colorectal cancers , but little in known about how the mutant protein contributes to onset and progression of the disease .	
12516957-1	The activation of NF-kappaB is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation of its endogenous polypeptide inhibitor , inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaBalpha .	
12516957-0	Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , regulates critical survival pathways in a variety of different cell types , including human pancreatic cancer cells .	
12516957-3	Comparison of PS-341's effects on the growth of eight different human pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed marked heterogeneity in drug responsiveness , ranging from highly resistant ( IC50 > 10 microM ; Panc-48 , HS766T , and Mia-PaCa-2 ) to extremely sensitive ( IC50 < 40 nM ; L3.6pl , Hpaf2 , and BxPC3 ) .	
12516957-2	We investigated the effects of PS-341 , a peptide boronate inhibitor of the proteasome in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo .	
12516957-5	Direct quantification of apoptosis revealed that PS-341's effects on cell growth largely correlated with sensitivity to programmed cell death .	8 81
12516957-4	However , these effects did not correlate with differential inhibition of NF-kappaB activation .	
12516957-7	Laser scanning cytometer-mediated quantification of drug-induced apoptosis in the xenografts confirmed that PS-341 induced DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 in L3.6pl tumors but not in Mia-PaCa-2 tumors .	8 81
12516957-6	Evaluation of PS-341's effects on established orthotopic tumor xenografts demonstrated that biweekly intravenous administration of the maximum-tolerated dose of the drug ( 1 mg/kg ) led to significant reductions in the volumes of L3.6pl tumors but not Mia-PaCa-2 tumors .	
12516957-9	Taken together , our results demonstrate that PS-341 inhibits the growth of human pancreatic tumors via direct effects on tumor cells and indirect effects on the tumor vasculature .	7 71
12516957-8	However , histological examination of drug-treated tumors revealed extensive central necrosis and reductions in microvessel density and VEGF expression in both tumor types .	71 7 711
22827697-2	Immunoblot was performed to find that BTE could induce up-regulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and inhibit mesenchymal markers such as snail-1 and vimentin .	
22827697-3	BTE inhibited p-FAK and p-paxillin , indicating the anti-EMT effect of BTE in oral squamous cell carcinoma .	
22827697-4	BTE was evidenced by its inhibition of the tumor growth of SCC-4 cells via cancer cell xenografted nude mice mode .	
22827697-5	These results suggested that BTE could reduce invasion by reversing EMT in human oral cancer cells .	11 1
22906929-2	In many other malignancies the therapeutic role for hedgehog inhibition though intriguing , based on preclinical data , is far from assured .	
22906929-3	Hedgehog inhibition is not an established part of the treatment paradigm of sarcoma but the scientific rationale for a possible benefit is compelling .	
22906929-0	The hedgehog signaling pathway is important in embryogenesis and post natal development .	
22906929-1	Constitutive activation of the pathway due to mutation of pathway components occurs in of medulloblastomas and also in basal cell carcinomas .	
22906929-6	In Ewing sarcoma/PNET tumors the Gli1 transcription factor is a direct target of the EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein present in 85% of cases .	
22906929-7	In many cases of rhabdomyosarcomas there is increased expression of Gli1 ( Ragazzini et al. , 2004 ) .	
22906929-4	In chondrosarcoma there is evidence of hedgehog pathway activation and an ontologic comparison between growth plate chondrocyte differentiation and different chondrosarcoma subtypes .	
22495714-6	The PCR products were separated on 1.7% agarose gels .	
22906929-8	Additionally , a third of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas have loss of Chr.9q22 that encompasses the patched locus ( Bridge et al. , 2000 ) .	
22906929-9	The potential to treat osteosarcoma by inhibition of Gli2 and the role of the pathway in ovarian fibromas and other connective tissue tumors is also discussed ( Nagao et al. , 2011 ; Hirotsu et al. , 2010 ) .	
22990536-5	Neoplastic cells of the ovarian carcinoma expressed EG-VEGF in 73.33% of the cases , as a cytoplasmic granular product of reaction .	71 7 711
22990536-4	In the present study , we analyzed 30 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer , and the immunohistochemical expression of EG-VEGF was compared with the conventional clinico-pathological parameters of prognosis .	
22990536-7	The expression of EG-VEGF was found in patients with stage III and IV , but not in stage II .	71 7 711
22990536-6	We found a strong correlation between the expression of EG-VEGF at protein level and tumor stage , grade , and microscopic type .	71 7 711
22990536-1	Many growth factors are involved in the development of the tumor-associated vasculature , and from these , endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor ( EG-VEGF ) seems to play a crucial role .	
22990536-0	Ovarian cancer-related angiogenesis is a complex process orchestrated by many positive and negative regulators .	
22990536-3	Although EG-VEGF was detected in both normal and neoplastic ovaries , its clinical significance remains controversial .	
22990536-2	EG-VEGF is the first organ-specific angiogenic factor and its effects are restricted to the endothelial cells of the endocrine glands .	
22990536-9	No positive reaction was found in the cases with mucinous carcinoma .	
22990536-8	The majority of serous adenocarcinoma , half of the cases with clear cell carcinoma and two cases with endometrioid carcinoma showed definite expression in tumor cells .	
1491701-3	The unusual biphasic expression of IRF-1 mRNA is accompanied both times by de novo IRF-1 protein synthesis .	
1491701-2	Surprisingly , IRF-1 is expressed twice during a single PRL-induced growth cycle : first during the early G1 phase , in an immediate transient peak from 15 min to 2 h , and second during the G1/S phase transition , in a broader peak beginning at 8 h .	91 9
1491701-1	Upon PRL stimulation , the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) is induced as a novel T-cell activation gene in Nb2 cells .	
1491701-0	PRL induces quiescent Nb2 rat T-lymphoma cells to undergo mitogenesis .	
1491701-7	Our data suggest that PRL and one putative nuclear mediator , IRF-1 , may be important in two distinct phases of the cell cycle : first in cell cycle activation , and then in S phase progression .	91 9
1491701-6	By washing out PRL at various times during G1 , we found a direct correlation among the length of PRL exposure , the second peak of IRF-1 mRNA expression , and DNA synthesis .	
1491701-5	IRF-1 protein expressed in G1 exhibits a half-life of about 25 min , whereas in the S phase , the half-life is about 60 min .	91 9
1491701-4	However , the rate of IRF-1 protein turnover appears to be different in G1 and S phases .	91 9
1348967-2	Invasive tumors stained more frequently with the anti-myc monoclonal antibody than did noninvasive tumors , while the level of expression in normal breast tissue was much less than that in breast cancer .	
1348967-3	Membrane staining of the c-erbB-2 protein was demonstrated in 29% ( 4 of 14 ) of noninvasive ductal carcinomas and in 45% ( 19 of 42 ) of invasive breast carcinomas .	
1348967-0	c-myc , c-erbB-2 , and Ki-67 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 11 normal breast tissues and 42 invasive and 14 noninvasive breast carcinomas .	
1348967-1	The c-myc product was detected in all breast carcinoma specimens and in 7 of 11 normal breast tissues .	
1348967-6	In 42 invasive breast carcinomas , the expression of c-myc , c-erbB-2 , and Ki-67 proliferation marker were compared with lymph node status , estrogen receptor status , progesterone receptor status , and age of patients at diagnosis. c-erbB-2 overexpression and Ki-67 overexpression were identified as the only factors associated with lymph node status .	
1348967-7	We concluded that they might be additional prognostic factors for breast carcinoma .	
1348967-4	None of the 11 normal breast tissue samples was positive .	
1348967-5	The mean value of Ki-67-positive cells was 0.91 +/- 0.31% for normal breast tissue , 4.57 +/- 1.36% for noninvasive ductal carcinoma , and 12.76 +/- 2.18% for invasive breast cancer .	9
22719059-4	Ligand binding , molecular modeling , mammalian two-hybrid and immunoblot assays revealed effects of the Q865H mutation on ligand dissociation , AR intramolecular interactions , and receptor stability .	
22719059-5	Microarray expression profiling demonstrated that DHT and MPA regulate distinct transcriptional programs in MDA-MB-453 cells .	
22719059-6	Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that DHT- but not MPA-regulated genes were associated with estrogen-responsive transcriptomes from MCF-7 cells and the Wnt signaling pathway .	
22719059-7	These findings suggest that the divergent proliferative responses of MDA-MB-453 cells to DHT and MPA result from the different genetic programs elicited by these two ligands through the AR-Q865H variant .	
22719059-0	Recent evidence indicates that the estrogen receptor-α-negative , androgen receptor ( AR)-positive molecular apocrine subtype of breast cancer is driven by AR signaling .	
22719059-1	The MDA-MB-453 cell line is the prototypical model of this breast cancer subtype ; its proliferation is stimulated by androgens such as 5α-dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) but inhibited by the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) via AR-mediated mechanisms .	
22719059-2	We report here that the AR gene in MDA-MB-453 cells contains a G-T transversion in exon 7 , resulting in a receptor variant with a glutamine to histidine substitution at amino acid 865 ( Q865H ) in the ligand binding domain .	9 93
22719059-3	Compared with wild-type AR , the Q865H variant exhibited reduced sensitivity to DHT and MPA in transactivation assays in MDA-MB-453 and PC-3 cells but did not respond to non-androgenic ligands or receptor antagonists .	9 93
22829774-5	In addition , ALT is associated with extensive genome rearrangements , marked micronucleation , defects in the G2/M checkpoint , and altered double-strand break ( DSB ) repair .	5 62 51 6
20134230-4	Using the incomplete R-M system we were able to perturb the balance between methylation and restriction in an inducible manner .	
20134230-5	We demonstrate that upon the SOS-induced DNA repair in the mitomycin C treated cells , restriction significantly reduces cell viability .	62 6
20134230-6	Similar results for the well-studied wild type EcoRI R-M system , expressed constitutively in Escherichia coli , were obtained .	
20134230-7	Our data provide further insights into the benefits and disadvantages of maintaining of a type II R-M system , highlighting its impact on host cell fitness .	
20134230-0	The contribution of a type II restriction-modification system ( R-M system ) to genome integrity and cell viability was investigated .	
20134230-1	We established experimental conditions which enabled the achievement of hemimethylated and unmethylated states for the specific bases of the recognition sequences of the host's DNA .	
20134230-2	To achieve this , we constructed the MboII R-M system containing only one ( i.e .	
20134230-3	M2.MboII ) out of two functional MboII methyltransferases found in Moraxella bovis .	
22829774-0	The Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres ( ALT ) pathway is a telomerase-independent pathway for telomere maintenance that is active in a significant subset of human cancers and in vitro immortalized cell lines .	
22829774-1	ALT is thought to involve templated extension of telomeres through homologous recombination , but the genetic or epigenetic changes that unleash ALT are not known .	
12244187-4	In contrast , weekly injections of CpG ODN into the margin of already established tumors resulted in regression of tumors and complete cure of mice .	
11964309-4	We demonstrate a novel mechanism for the oncogenic capacity of Notch1 by showing that the interaction between intact Notch1 on tumor cells and its ligand Jagged1 dramatically induces proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis in vitro .	9 81 8
12244187-6	Mice with two bilateral C26 tumors rejected both tumors upon peritumoral injection of one tumor , indicating the development of a systemic immune response .	2 21
12244187-7	The tumor specificity of the immune response was demonstrated in mice bearing a C26 tumor and a Renca tumor at the same time .	2 21
12244187-0	The immune system of vertebrates is able to detect bacterial DNA based on the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs .	
12244187-1	We examined the therapeutic potential of oligodeoxynucleotides with CpG motifs ( CpG ODN ) in a colon carcinoma model in BALB/c mice .	
12244187-2	Tumors were induced by s.c. injection of syngeneic C26 cells or Renca kidney cancer cells as a control .	
11964309-5	We further provide evidence that in Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma , Jagged1 is expressed in malignant and in bystander cells colocalizing with Notch1-positive tumor cells .	
20693267-6	Dietary calcium was positively associated with low-grade cancer but inversely associated with high-grade cancer ( for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 , odds ratios were 1.27 ( 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.57 ) and 0.43 ( 95% CI : 0.21 , 0.89 ) , respectively ) .	
20693267-7	Neither dietary nor supplemental intakes of nutrients often suggested for prostate cancer prevention , including lycopene , long-chain n-3 fatty acids , vitamin D , vitamin E , and selenium , were significantly associated with cancer risk .	
20817674-2	Luteolin , a flavone found in medicinal herbs and plants , has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory , antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activities .	
20693267-5	Risk of high-grade cancer was associated with high intake of polyunsaturated fats ( quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 : odds ratio = 2.41 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.33 , 4.38 ) .	
20817674-4	METHODS C57BL/6 mice were treated with cisplatin ( 20 mg/kg ) with or without treatment with luteolin ( 50 mg/kg for 3 days ) .	
20817674-5	Renal function , histological changes , degree of oxidative stress and tubular apoptosis were examined .	
20817674-6	The effects of luteolin on cisplatin-induced expression of renal p53 , PUMA-α and Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated .	
20817674-7	RESULTS Treatment of mice with cisplatin resulted in renal damage , showing an increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels , tubular damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis .	a21 a2 a 8 81
20924143-0	Cetuximab is a chimeric antibody registered for the therapy of advanced colorectal carcinoma .	
20924143-1	Cancer and anticancer therapy are associated with oxidative stress , and disorders of antioxidant balance may be involved in the toxicity associated with anticancer treatment .	
20924143-2	The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of serum retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein during the first month of treatment with cetuximab and chemotherapy .	
20924143-3	Twenty-five consecutive patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with a combination of chemotherapy and cetuximab were included in the present study .	
20924143-4	Serum retinol and alpha-tocopherol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and serum C-reactive protein was determined using commercial kits .	
20924143-5	Significant correlation was observed between baseline concentrations of retinol and C-reactive protein ( r(s)=-0.54 , p<0.01 ) .	a a2
20924143-6	Median survival of patients who had baseline serum retinol below 1.25 µmol/L was 10 mo compared to 18 mo for patients who had serum retinol equal or above 1.25 µmol/L ( p<0.05 ) ; median survival of patients who had serum C-reactive protein below 24 mg/L was significantly longer compared to patients with C-reactive protein levels equal or above 24 mg/L ( 18 vs. 7 mo , p<0.05 ) , but no difference in survival was observed based on alpha-tocopherol levels .	
20924143-7	Twenty-two patients had evaluation of retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein at least once during the follow up .	
20924143-8	Serum concentration of alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the therapy , but retinol and C-reactive protein concentrations remained unchanged .	
20924143-9	In conclusion , a significant correlation was observed between serum retinol and C-reactive protein .	a a2
23027128-5	We show that FAK is a direct substrate of PTK6 in vitro and in vivo .	
22883142-4	This haplotype , referred to as N , was discovered through a resequencing survey of the entire coding region of STAT2 in a global sample of 90 individuals .	
20395120-7	Glut-1 was frequently found in peri-necrotic regions , occurring in 9/34 lymphomas , 6/12 melanomas , and 5/16 glioblastomas ; and in 43/54 lung , 22/84 colon , and 23/60 ovarian tumors .	83 8
20395120-6	In this study , we carried out immunohistochemical detection of Glut-1 protein in many tumor and normal tissue types in a range of tissue microarrays .	
20395120-5	Glut-1 may be a useful biomarker to validate tissue microarrays for use in studies of hypoxia-regulated genes in cancer .	
20395120-4	To evaluate hypoxia markers , tissue cores must show the architectural features of hypoxia ; i.e. viable tissue surrounding necrotic regions .	
20395120-3	Tissue microarrays , however , provide a rapid , inexpensive means of profiling biomarker expression .	
20395120-2	So far , studies of Glut-1 in cancer have utilized conventional immunohistochemical analysis in a series of individual biopsy or surgical specimens .	
20395120-1	The glucose transporter Glut-1 is a prognostic factor and putative hypoxia marker .	
20395120-0	The hypoxic tumor microenvironment is associated with malignant progression and poor treatment response .	
21061467-8	Our results strongly suggest that CPDE arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase and triggers apoptosis by caspase activation .	
20395120-9	In conclusion , tissue microarrays enable the observation of Glut-1 expression in peri-necrotic regions , which may be linked to hypoxia , and reflect previous studies showing differential Glut-1 expression across tumor types and non-malignant tissue .	83 8
20395120-8	Expression was rare in breast ( 6/40 ) and prostate ( 1/57 ) tumors , and in normal tissue , was restricted to spleen , tongue , and CNS endothelium .	
22896630-1	The cellular responses to IFN-γ are complex , and emerging evidence suggests that IFN-γ may regulate autophagic functions .	
22896630-0	IFN-γ is a master regulator of the immune responses that occur in the transplanted kidney , acting both on the immune system and on the graft itself .	
22896630-3	In this study , we identify a novel mechanism by which IFN-γ activates autophagy in human kidney epithelial cells and provide new insights into how autophagy regulates immune functions in response to IFN-γ .	82 a1 a 8
22896630-2	Conversely , autophagy modulates innate and adaptive immune functions in various contexts .	
22896630-5	Further , tryptophan supplementation and RNA interference directed against GCN2 inhibited IFN-γ-induced autophagy .	82 8
22896630-4	Our results indicate that IFN-γ promotes tryptophan depletion , activates the eIF2α kinase general control nonderepressible-2 ( GCN2 ) , and leads to an increase in the autophagic flux .	82 8
22896630-7	These findings assign to IFN-γ a novel function in the regulation of autophagy , which , in turn , modulates IFN-γ-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines .	82 a2 a 8
22896630-6	This process is of functional relevance because autophagy regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by human kidney epithelial cells in response to IFN-γ .	a a2
23027128-3	Although not expressed in normal breast or ovary , PTK6 promotes anchorage-independent survival of breast and ovarian tumor cells .	
22534171-8	In contrast , ERK inhibitor PD98059 and ERK siRNA enhanced TF promoter activity by 2.5 fold and induced an increase in TF mRNA and protein levels in a dose dependent manner in these cells .	
22534171-9	The PI3K/Akt pathway was shown to be involved in PD98059-induced TF expression because the induction was inhibited by PI3K/Akt inhibitors .	921 92 9
22534171-0	BACKGROUND Tissue factor ( TF ) , an initiator of blood coagulation , participates in cancer progression and metastasis .	
22534171-1	We recently found that inhibition of MAPK/ERK upregulated both full length TF ( flTF ) and soluble isoform TF ( asTF ) gene expression and cell-associated TF activity in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells .	
22534171-2	We explored the possible mechanisms , especially the possible interaction with EGFR and PI3K/Akt pathways .	
22534171-3	METHODS A plasmid containing TF promoter -2174  plus luciferase reporter gene was introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells to evaluate TF promoter activity .	
22534171-4	In order to study the interaction of these pathways , ERK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) , PI3K inhibitors ( LY294002 , wortmannin ) , Akt inhibitor ( A6730 ) , and EGFR inhibitor ( erlotinib ) as well as the corresponding siRNAs were used to treat MDA-MB-231 cells , and ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells .	
22534171-5	Quantitative PCR and western blot were used to determine TF expression .	
22534171-6	One stage clotting assays were used to measure pro-coagulation activity of the MDA-MB-231 cells .	
22534171-7	RESULTS We show that PI3K inhibitors LY294002 , wortmannin and A6730 significantly inhibited TF promoter activity , and reduced TF mRNA and protein levels due to the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation .	
21061467-2	The present study assessed the anti-proliferative activity of the medicinal plant Centrosema pubescens Benth .	
21061467-3	Centrosema pubescens dichloromethane extract ( CPDE ) inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 ( promyelocytic acute leukaemia ) cells with an IC₅₀ value of 5 μg/ml .	
21061467-0	Cell division and apoptosis are two crucial components of tumor biology and the importance of increased cell proliferation and reduced cell death have made them valid therapeutic targets .	
21061467-1	The plant kingdom is a relatively underexploited cache of novel drugs , and crude extracts of plants are known for their synergistic activity .	
21061467-6	Quantitative assessment of the effective arrest of the cell cycle and of apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry .	
21061467-7	CPDE exhibited negligible cytotoxicity even at the highest dose tested ( 100 μg/ml ) in both normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in an in vitro model ( HL-60 ) .	
23065281-10	Moreover , significantly less ZEB1 siRNA-transfected cells migrated through Transwell chambers in the LSCC tissue than that in the control groups ( untransfected or transfected with control siRNA , p<0.01 ) .	11 1
23065281-11	The expression of the ZEB1 gene in LSCC tissues is downregulated with the expression of E-cadherin .	
23065281-12	On the other hand , the expression of siRNA against ZEB1 promotes E-cadherin expression and suppresses the invasive ability conferred by E-cadherin .	11 1
23065281-13	In conclusion , our data suggested that overexpression of the ZEB1 gene is possibly associated with the occurrence , development , invasion of LSCC .	11 1
21061467-4	Further studies also showed that CPDE induces growth arrest at the G1 phase and specifically down-regulates the expressions of cyclin E and CDK2 and up-regulates p27(CKI) levels .	511 5 51
21061467-5	These events apparently lead to the induction of apoptosis , which was demonstrated qualitatively by a DNA fragmentation assay and propidium iodide staining .	8 81
1330343-11	Incidence of esophageal tumors were also greatest in the NMBzA-treated , immunocompromised animals .	2
1330343-10	Lipid peroxidation and serum transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were greatest in mice given NMBzA and infected with the retroviruses .	
1330343-13	These results suggest that vitamin E plays an antioxidant function that retards the incidence of esophageal cancers in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised animals .	2
1330343-12	Mice fed vitamin E-supplemented diets showed increased ( P < 0.05 ) hepatic concentrations of vitamin E and vitamin A , decreased activities of serum transaminases , decreased indices of lipid peroxidation , and decreased size and frequency of esophageal tumors in both the immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised mice .	2
24260485-2	Negative regulation of this pathway by deleterious mutations or by oncogenes results in cell transformation and tumor progression .	
20406967-10	The latter delayed development of aggressive melanomas but was overridden by inflammation .	a a2
22318307-2	We found that D-limonene ( 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight ) treatments to the mouse skin significantly reduced the TPA-induced ( a ) edema and hyperplasia ( p < 0.001 ) ; ( b ) expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ; ( c ) ornithine decarboxylase activity ( p < 0.001 ) ; and ( d ) [ (3)H ] thymidine incorporation into DNA ( p < 0.001 ) .	
22778940-10	Conclusions .	
22778940-11	Results comparable to radical surgery can be achieved by LET only in patients with T(1) N(0) G(1) tumours with low-risk histological features , whereas deeper or more aggressive tumours should be addressed by radical surgery ( RS ) .	
20943596-5	CONCLUSIONS Taking into account the current understanding of the plausible biological role of the examined endocrine factors , those likely to be involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer are SHBG and IGF-2 , with higher cord blood levels among Chinese , and IGF-1 , with higher cord blood levels among Caucasian women .	9 92
20943596-4	In cord blood , we found significantly ( P < 0.01 ) higher levels of estradiol ( 44.2% ) , testosterone ( 54.5% ) , IGF-2 ( 22.7% ) and strikingly SHBG ( 104.6% ) in Shanghai women , whereas the opposite was true for IGF-1 ( -36.8% ) .	9 92
22215664-3	Oral administration of this compound markedly diminishes the brain tumor volumes in both subcutaneous and intracranial models .	
22215664-2	To search for small molecules treating this aggressive cancer , we have established a cell-based screening and successfully identified acridine yellow G that preferentially blocks cell proliferation of the most malignant U87MG/EGFRvIII cells over the less malignant U87MG/PTEN cells .	
20943596-1	We determined levels of pregnancy hormones in Boston and Shanghai to identify those possibly involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer .	
20943596-0	BACKGROUND Breast cancer is less common in China than in the United States and perinatal characteristics predict breast cancer risk in the offspring .	
20943596-3	RESULTS In both centers , hormone levels at the 16th were predictive of those at the 27th gestational week , but there was little correlation between maternal and cord blood levels .	9 92
20943596-2	Participants and methods : We compared maternal and cord blood levels of estradiol , estriol , testosterone , progesterone , prolactin , insulin-like growth factors ( IGF ) 1 and 2 , insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 , adiponectin and sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) in 241 Caucasian and 295 Chinese women .	
23197380-10	Finally , we have confirmed the role of AQP1 in sustaining an active endothelium during angiogenesis and we have shown that AQP1 reduction causes an increase in VEGF levels .	71 7 711
23197380-11	In conclusion , this study validates AQP1 as a pro-angiogenic protein , relevant for the therapy of cancer and other angiogenic-related diseases such as psoriasis , endometriosis , arthritis and atherosclerosis .	7 71
23304206-4	Subsequently , RA-triggered DU145 apoptosis detected by sub-G1 phase accumulation and Annexin V staining could also be blocked by CP treatment .	8 81
21982881-6	Conversely , the cancer mutation Q564H reduced turnover by 25% .	
21193016-0	Despite the deployment of multimodal therapies involving neurosurgical resection , radio- and polychemotherapy , the prognosis for glioblastoma patients remains poor .	
21193016-1	These tumors are pathologically characterized by their associated angiogenesis and diffuse brain invasion , processes that are probably closely linked to the unfavorable prognosis of this disease .	
21193016-2	Accordingly , pharmacological inhibition of glioblastoma invasion and approaches that impede angiogenesis are considered to be promising therapeutic strategies to combat these tumors .	
21193016-3	Nevertheless , the anti-angiogenic therapies for glioblastoma currently available are transient and palliative at best .	
21193016-4	Blocking the effects of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) may represent a novel mean of inhibiting the angiogenesis associated with glioblastoma , as it mediates the angiogenesis induced by other factors and it is an angiogenic factor by itself .	
21193016-5	In addition , the survival of glioma cells and their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents are highly FGF-dependent .	
21193016-6	We show here that a recently described inhibitor of FGF , 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-sulfonate ( 2,5DHPS , dobesilate ) , stimulates the apoptosis of tumor cells , inhibits glioblastoma invasion and suppresses its associated angiogenesis .	9 92 7 71
21193016-7	Moreover , this agent augments the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents in a rat model of orthotopic brain tumor .	9 92
21193016-8	These results suggest that 2,5DHPS treatment may represent a promising therapy for malignant glioma .	
23151902-3	We also demonstrated that AR-42 , a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor , inhibited proliferation of both Ben-Men-1 and normal meningeal cells by increasing expression of p16INK4A , p21CIP1/WAF1 , and p27KIP1 .	
23023398-8	Both SRC-1 and SIRT-1 overexpression in DSFX-treated MCF-7 cells reduced CXCR4 cellular levels implying that both co-regulators are crucial factors in the determination of the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells .	1 12
23023398-7	In an attempt to shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in cancer-related inflammation , we investigated the role of the two common p53 and HIF-1α co-regulators SRC-1 and SIRT-1 , in the expression of the highly potent metastatic chemokine receptor CXCR4 .	
23023398-6	Functional crosstalk between HIF-1α and p53 pathways mediated by modulators shared between the two transcription factors such as SRC-1 and SIRT-1 differentially regulate the expression of distinct subsets of their target genes under variable stress conditions .	
23023398-5	The expression of these genes is often modulated by the p53 tumor suppressor protein that induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in neoplastic cells .	
22848179-11	CONCLUSION This work demonstrates the feasibility of determining the genotoxic potential of nanofibers derived from plant cellulose to obtain information vital both for the future usage of these materials in agribusiness and for an understanding of their environmental impacts .	6
23023398-3	HIF-1α and NF-κB transcription factors are important players for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory and potentially oncogenic environment .	
23023398-2	Detailed knowledge , therefore , of the regulatory mechanisms determining cytokine levels is essential to understand the pathogenesis of breast cancer .	
23023398-1	Pro-inflammatory mediators along with growth/survival factors within the tumor microenvironment potentiate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-α ) , chemotactic cytokines and their receptors ( CXCR4 , CXCL12 , CXCL8 ) and angiogenic factors ( VEGF ) that often overcome the effect of anti-inflammatory molecules ( IL-4 , IL-10 ) thus evading the host's antitumor immunity .	
23023398-0	Chronic inflammation is a critical component in breast cancer progression .	
22768158-4	RNAi-based OCT4 knock down mediated differentiation resulted in the activation of the poised OXPHOS machinery by expressing missing key proteins such as NDUFC1 , UQCRB and COX , increase in TCA cycle activity and decreased lactate metabolism .	
22768158-5	These results shed light on the metabolite layer of pluripotent stem cells and could potentially establish novel metabolic markers of self renewal and pluripotency .	
12231192-8	This technique enabled us to detect heterogeneity of dermal mast cell prevalence in buttock skin between individuals and provided evidence of an association between high dermal mast cell prevalence and BCC development in two diverse populations .	
12231192-9	We hypothesize that mast cells function in humans , as in mouse strains , by initiating immunosuppression following UV irradiation and , thereby , allowing a permissive environment for the development of BCC .	2 22
22768158-0	While human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and human embryonal carcinoma cells ( hECCs ) have been studied extensively at the levels of the genome , transcriptome , proteome and epigenome our knowledge of their corresponding metabolomes is limited .	
22990536-11	Based on these data , we concluded that EG-VEGF expression in tumor cells of the epithelial ovarian cancer is a good marker of unfavorable prognosis and could be an attractive therapeutic target in patients with advanced-stage tumors , refractory conventional chemotherapy .	71 7 711
22768158-1	Here , we present the metabolic signatures of hESCs and hESCs obtained by untargeted gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) .	
22768158-2	Whilst some metabolites are common to both cell types , representing the self-renewal and house-keeping signatures , others were either higher ( e.g. , octadecenoic acid , glycerol-3-phosphate , 4-hydroxyproline ) or lower ( e.g. , glutamic acid , mannitol , malic acid , GABA ) in hESCs ( H9 ) compared to hECCs ( NTERA2 ) , these represent cell type specific signatures .	
22728792-7	The results of this study show that even a short exposure to ethylene oxide may result in a significant rise in haemoglobin adduct levels .	
20090913-3	Interestingly , CEACAM1-L , but not CEACAM1-S , negatively regulates proliferation via its ITIM domain , while in proliferating cells no CEACAM expression is detectable .	
20090913-2	Here we demonstrate that cell surface expression of CEACAM1 on confluent A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells plays a critical role in differentiated , contact-inhibited cell growth .	5 52
20090913-1	However , little is known about the functional impact of these molecules on undifferentiated cell growth and tumor progression .	
20090913-0	CEACAM1 , CEA/CEACAM5 , and CEACAM6 are cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) of the carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) family that have been shown to be deregulated in lung cancer and in up to 50% of all human cancers .	
20090913-6	Taken together , our data suggest that post-confluent contact inhibition is established and maintained by CEACAM1-4L , but disturbances of CEACAM1 signalling by CEACAM1-4S and other CEACAMs lead to undifferentiated cell growth and malignant transformation .	5 52
20090913-5	We also found that A549 cells expressed significant amounts of non-membrane anchored variants of CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 , representing a putative source for the increased CEACAM5/6 serum levels frequently found in lung cancer patients .	
20090913-4	Furthermore , we show for the first time that CEACAM6 acts as an inducer of cellular proliferation in A549 cells , likely by interfering with the contact-inhibiting signal triggered by CEACAM1-4L , leading to undifferentiated anchorage-independent cell growth .	5 52
20188144-5	The secretion of inflammatory cytokines was also investigated , together with the epithelial character of the treated cells .	
20188144-4	METHODS In this study we have used a cell culture model of fat-loading using oleate-treated human hepatoblastoma ( C3A ) cells to investigate how fat-loading and selenium status might influence the production of collagen in response to TGFbeta1 .	
20188144-7	Most of these responses were considerably enhanced when cells were fat-loaded with oleate and were attenuated by selenium addition at a dose that optimised the expression of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase .	a21 a2 a
20188144-6	RESULTS We found that in response to treatment with TGFbeta1 , C3A cells produced mRNA encoding the pro-alphaI chain of procollagen I , secreted procollagen I peptide , up-regulated production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin , and down-regulated albumin production .	a a2
20188144-1	Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) is a serious consequence of NAFLD where chronic tissue damage and inflammation result in fibrosis which may progress to cirrhosis .	
20188144-0	BACKGROUND Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is associated with obesity , insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis .	
20188144-3	The contributions of individual liver cell types to fibrogenesis remain controversial and the influence of selenium status has not been investigated .	
20188144-2	Transforming growth factor beta1 ( TGFbeta1 ) , proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress are thought to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of these conditions .	
1540219-4	This indicates that persons with low activity carry a large deletion mutation within the GST class Mu gene .	63 6
1540219-5	The enzymatically determined antimode between low and high activity determined as 10 pmol/min/1 million lymphocytes in the assay with 50 microM TSO could be clearly confirmed by genotyping .	
1540219-0	Glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) class Mu activity was determined in 145 unrelated hospital patients in Berlin by measuring their conjugation activity towards the specific substrate trans-stilbene oxide ( TSO ) with two substrate concentrations ( 50 and 250 microM ) in homogenates prepared from lymphocytes .	
20188144-8	CONCLUSIONS Our data establish that both fat-loading and suboptimal selenium status enhance collagen and IL-8 production by C3A hepatocytes in response to TGFbeta1 , possibly as part of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition .	
1540219-2	In 142 of 145 cases , phenotype was confirmed by the results of a genotyping procedure using the polymerase chain reaction technique .	
1540219-3	Two fragments of 273 and about 650 bp including one and two introns , respectively , could always be amplified from genomic DNA in individuals with high GST class Mu activity and could not be amplified in persons with impaired glutathione-TSO conjugation activity .	
22264502-8	Of note , blockade of AR signaling with siRNA also resulted in a suppression of PlncRNA-1 expression in CaP cell lines .	
21058192-3	Three other brands showed lower antiproliferation activity .	
21058192-2	Antiproliferation IC(50) for Brand A regular and decaffeinated coffee on A2780 cells was 1:70.79 ± 5.66 and 1:55.68 ± 2.00 dilution ( vol/vol ) in tissue culture medium ( mean ± standard error of the mean ; N = 12 ) , respectively , and slightly lower on A2780CP70 cells .	
21058192-1	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferation effect of 4 different regular and decaffeinated coffee brews and 3 of coffee's bioactive ingredients-caffeine , chlorogenic acids , and caffeic acid-on 2 human ovarian cancer cell lines alone and in combination with cisplatin ( CDDP ) .	
21058192-0	Numerous scientific studies have examined the relationship between coffee consumption and an array of medical conditions , including cancer , and yet the direct effect of commercially brewed coffee on cancer cells has not been evaluated .	
21058192-7	To our knowledge , this is the first report showing the antiproliferation activity and the additive effect with CDDP of commercially prepared coffee brews on human cancer cell lines .	
21058192-6	Flow cytometry analysis showed that coffee treatment induced apoptosis of A2780 and A2780CP70 cells .	8 81
21058192-5	In combination with CDDP , both Brand A coffee brews , and the 3 bioactive compounds , showed additive antiproliferation effect on both cancer cell lines .	
21058192-4	Antiproliferation IC(50) concentrations of chlorogenic acids and caffeic acid are many folds lower than caffeine .	
20184723-0	BACKGROUND Lung cancer often develops in association with chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases with an influx of neutrophils .	
11872299-8	RESULTS Cyclin D1 expression varied among tumors by 40-fold , and its magnitude positively correlated with poorer tumor radioresponse ( higher TCD(50) values ) .	91 9
12231192-5	This skin site was investigated to avoid any changes in mast cell prevalence caused by sun exposure .	
22264502-9	CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and androgen receptor contribute to CaP pathogenesis and that PlncRNA-1 is a potential therapy target .	
15515527-10	VEGF and MVD were possible to be prognostic discriminators in hypopharyngeal carcinoma .	71 7 711
15515527-11	PDGF expression in lymph nodes was significant higher than in primary tumors , and MVD expression in primary tumor was significant higher than in lymph nodes .	71 7 711
23367225-4	Periodic heating ( 12 hours per day ) was carried out for 3 days , 7 days , 14 days , and 21 days , respectively .	
22615834-2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We first compared methylation occurring at the sequences ( -664 flanking the RARRES1 promoter in primary breast carcinomas to that in adjacent benign tissues .	
23266555-1	Among the three known Orai isoforms , Orai3 has gained increased attention , notably for its emerging role in cancer .	
23266555-0	Members of the Orai family are highly selective calcium ion channels that play an important role in store-operated calcium entry .	
23266555-3	Here , we investigate the downstream signaling mechanisms affected by Orai3 silencing , leading to the subsequent functional impact specifically seen in MCF-7 cancer cells .	
22615834-3	Surprisingly , tumor cores displayed significantly elevated methylation occurring solely at the upstream region ( -664 while the downstream element ( -85 proximal to the transcriptional start site ( +1 ) remained largely unchanged .	
23266555-5	This is likely mediated through the MAP Kinase pathway , as we observed decreased pERK1/2 levels and cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase after Orai3 silencing .	51 511 9 5 91 921 92
23266555-4	We report a correlation between Orai3 and c-myc expression in tumor tissues and in the MCF-7 cancer cell line by demonstrating that Orai3 down-regulation reduces both expression and activity of the proto-oncogene c-myc .	
23266555-7	This connection provides new clues in the downstream mechanism linking Orai3 channels and proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells .	91 9
23266555-6	Our results provide strong evidence that the c-myc proto-oncogene is influenced by the store-operated calcium entry channel Orai3 through the MAP kinase pathway .	
23055798-6	These findings are similar to those of some prior studies but differ from others , possibly due to excluding individuals with a personal or family history of cancer .	
23055798-7	Our sample was drawn from the community group and included individuals with or without a family or personal history of cancer .	
23055798-4	Molecular analyses were done by PCR followed by RFLP ( ACRS ) .	
23055798-5	The carrier frequencies for BRCA1 185delAG and 5382insC were 0.78 and 0 respectively , and 0.4 for the BRCA2 6174deT mutation .	63 6
23055798-2	Several studies were performed over the years in an attempt to elucidate the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in susceptibility to breast cancer .	
23055798-3	The aim of this study was to estimate the carrier frequency of certain common mutations in the BRCA1 ( 185delAG and 5382insC ) and BRCA2 ( 6174delT ) genes in an Ashkenazi Jewish population from Porto Alegre , Brazil .	
23055798-0	Certain mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population .	
23055798-1	Several factors contribute to this increased frequency , including consanguineous marriages and an event known as a " bottleneck " , which occurred in the past and caused a drastic reduction in the genetic variability of this population .	
23055798-8	Furthermore , increased dispersion among Ashkenazi subpopulations may be the result of strong genetic drift and/or admixture .	
23055798-9	It is therefore necessary to consider the effects of local admixture on the mismatch distributions of various Jewish populations .	
22443054-5	The tail length , olive tail moment , tail DNA ( % ) and the ratio of tail/head examined by SCGE were also increased with the increase of the dosage of CdTe QDs ( P < 0.01 ) .	61 6
22615834-8	Furthermore , knocking-down CTCF expression hampered RARRES1 expression , suggesting CTCF positively regulated RARRES1 transcription presumably by binding to unmethylated promoter poised at transcription-ready state .	
22848179-10	An important finding was that ruby cotton nanofibers did not cause any significant DNA breaks in the cell types employed .	61 6
22615834-9	Moreover , RARRES1 restoration not only impeded cell invasion but also promoted death induced by chemotherapeutic agents , denoting its tumor suppressive effect .	
11872299-6	Cell proliferative activity in tumors was determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) immunochemistry .	
11872299-7	The effect of irradiation on the expression of cyclin D1 or p27 proteins and on PCNA positivity was determined in the radiosensitive OCa-I and in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors .	
11872299-4	These tumors greatly differed in their radioresponse as assessed by TCD(50) .	
11872299-5	The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 proteins was determined by Western blotting .	
11872299-2	We further investigated the influence of radiation on cyclin D1 expression and the expression of p27 , an inhibitor of the cyclin D1 downstream pathway , as well as the relationship of these molecular determinants to cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in tumors exposed to radiation .	
11872299-3	METHODS AND MATERIALS Cyclin D1 expression was assayed in nine carcinomas syngeneic to C3Hf/Kam mice using Western blot analysis .	
11872299-0	PURPOSE We recently reported that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) positively correlated with radioresistance of murine carcinomas .	
11872299-1	Because cyclin D1 is a downstream sensor of EGFR activation , the present study investigated whether a relationship exists between the extent of cyclin D1 expression and in vivo radiocurability of murine tumors .	
12231192-2	Studies in a range of inbred mouse strains as well as mast cell-depleted mice reconstituted with mast cell precursors support a functional link between histamine-staining dermal mast cells and the extent of susceptibility to UVB-induced systemic immunomodulation .	
12231192-3	Humans , like mouse strains , display variations in dermal mast cell prevalence .	
12231192-0	Exposure to ultraviolet B ( UVB ) radiation ( 280-320 nm ) is the primary etiologic factor associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) .	
12231192-1	The outgrowth of these keratinocyte-derived skin lesions is enhanced by the ability of UVB to impair an immune response that would otherwise eliminate them .	
12231192-6	Two sections ( 4 microm ) per biopsy were immunohistochemically stained for detection of histamine-containing dermal mast cells .	
12231192-7	Computer-generated image analysis evaluated dermal mast cell prevalence in both sections by quantifying the total number of mast cells according to the total dermal area ( expressed as mast cells per square millimeter ) .	
12231192-4	In a study of Danish and South Australian BCC patients and control subjects , one 4-mm punch biopsy of non-sun-exposed buttock skin was sampled from each participant .	
11872299-9	The level of cyclin D1 expression paralleled that of EGFR .	91 93 9
23367225-7	Accordingly , the effect of mild hyperthermia on immune cell infiltration into tumors was also investigated .	
23367225-6	Biological evidences associated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis were examined using histological analyses .	
23367225-5	The tumor growth rate was found significantly decreased in comparison to the control without hyperthermia .	
22883142-2	However , no definitive case of adaptive introgression has yet been described .	
23367225-3	A mildly raised temperature ( i.e.39�C ) was imposed on the skin surface of the implanted tumor using a thermal heating pad .	
23367225-2	In this study , a novel thermal modality was built to introduce hyperthermia effect on tumor to suppress its growth and progression using 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma , a common animal model of metastatic breast cancer .	
23367225-1	Hyperthermia is considered as one of the means for controlling tumor growth .	
23367225-0	The new concept of keeping primary tumor under control in situ to suppress distant foci sheds light on the novel treatment of metastatic tumor .	
23367225-9	Further mechanistic studies will be performed to explore the quantitative relationship between tumor progression and thermal dose in the near future .	
23367225-8	It was demonstrated that a delayed tumor growth and malignancy progression was achieved by mediating tumor cell apoptosis , vascular injury , degrading metastasis potential and as well as inhibiting the immunosuppressive cell myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) recruitment .	12 22 1 2 8 81
22384233-4	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS An orthotopic liver tumor model in Buffalo rat was established using the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line McA-RH7777 .	
22384233-5	Two weeks after orthotopic liver tumor implantation , the rats underwent liver resection for tumor-bearing lobe and partial hepatic I/R injury .	
22384233-6	FTY720 ( 2 mg/kg ) was administered through the inferior caval vein before and after I/R injury .	
22384233-7	Blood samples were taken at days 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 for detection of circulating EPCs ( CD133+CD34+ ) .	
22384233-0	BACKGROUND Surgical procedures such as liver resection and liver transplantation are the first-line treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patients .	
22384233-1	However , the high incidence of tumor recurrence and metastasis after liver surgery remains a major problem .	
22384233-2	Recent studies have shown that hepatic ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury and endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) contribute to tumor growth and metastasis .	
22384233-3	We aim to investigate the mechanism of FTY720 , which was originally applied as an immunomodulator , on suppression of liver tumor metastasis after liver resection and partial hepatic I/R injury .	
12499280-4	Here , we isolated another Schwann cell-derived secreted inhibitor of angiogenesis , a 43-kDa protein identified as SPARC ( secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ) , an extracellular matrix protein .	
12499280-5	We found SPARC to be critical for the antiangiogenic phenotype of cultured Schwann cells .	7 71
12499280-6	We also show that purified SPARC potently inhibits angiogenesis and significantly impairs NB tumor growth in vivo .	7 71
12499280-7	SPARC may be an effective candidate for the treatment of children with clinically aggressive , Schwannian stroma-poor NB tumors .	
12499280-0	Neuroblastoma ( NB ) , a common pediatric neoplasm , consists of two main cell populations : neuroblastic/ganglionic cells and Schwann cells .	
12499280-1	NB tumors with abundant Schwannian stroma display a more benign clinical behavior than stroma-poor tumors .	
12499280-2	Recent studies suggest that Schwann cells influence NB tumor growth via secreted factors that induce differentiation , suppress proliferation , and inhibit angiogenesis .	
12499280-3	Two angiogenesis inhibitors , pigment epithelium-derived factor and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 , have been detected in Schwann cell secretions .	
23209436-6	The likely mechanism for the role of Fhit in replication fork progression is through regulation of Thymidine kinase 1 expression and thymidine triphosphate pool levels ; notably , restoration of nucleotide balance rescued DNA replication defects and suppressed DNA breakage in Fhit-deficient cells .	
19637241-8	We found that KCs in Nucling-KO mice were apoptotic possibly through the up-regulation of TNFalpha .	8 81
23209436-7	Depletion of Fhit did not activate the DNA damage response nor cause cell cycle arrest , allowing continued cell proliferation and ongoing chromosomal instability .	91 61 9 6
23209436-4	Here , we show in normal , transformed , and cancer-derived cell lines that Fhit-depletion causes replication stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks .	612 61 6
23209436-5	Using DNA combing , we observed a defect in replication fork progression in Fhit-deficient cells that stemmed primarily from fork stalling and collapse .	
22384233-8	Our results showed that intrahepatic and lung metastases were significantly inhibited together with less tumor angiogenesis by FTY720 treatment .	1 12 7 71
22384233-9	The number of circulating EPCs was also significantly decreased by FTY720 treatment from day 7 to day 28 .	
22615834-12	We also revealed the tumor suppressive roles exerted by RARRES1 in part by promoting breast epithelial cell death and by impeding cell invasion that is an important property for metastatic spread .	
23224295-10	Kinin receptors , especially B(1) receptors , appear to be implicated in bladder cancer progression .	9 93
22615834-10	Its role of attenuating invasion agreed with data generated from clinical specimens revealing that RARRES1 was generally downregulated in metastatic lymph nodes compared to the tumor cores .	
22615834-11	CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE This report delineated silencing of RARRES1 by hypermethylation is occurring at a proximal promoter element and is associated with a loss of binding to CTCF , an activator for RARRES1 expression .	
23224295-11	It is tempting to suggest that selective kinin antagonists might represent potential alternative therapies for bladder cancer .	
22354042-3	It remains , however , largely unexplored whether and how pro-tumourigenic inflammation regulates glucose metabolism in cancer cells .	
22354042-2	Chronic inflammation is a key promoting factor of tumourigenesis .	
22354042-1	This phenomenon , known as the Warburg effect , is an anomalous characteristic of glucose metabolism in cancer cells .	
22354042-0	Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis .	
22354042-7	Second , via targeting C/EBP\u03b2 ( a transcriptional activator for mir-143 ) , miR-155 represses mir-143 , a negative regulator of hk2 , thus resulting in upregulation of hk2 expression at the post-transcriptional level .	
22354042-6	First , miR-155 promotes hk2 transcription by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , a transcriptional activator for hk2 .	
22354042-5	We further show that miR-155 acts to upregulate hexokinase 2 ( hk2 ) , through two distinct mechanisms .	
22354042-4	Here , we show that pro-inflammatory cytokines promote glycolysis in breast cancer cells , and that the inflammation-induced miR-155 functions as an important mediator in this process .	a 31 3
22354042-9	We suggest that the miR-155/miR-143/HK2 axis may represent a common mechanism linking inflammation to the altered metabolism in cancer cells .	a 3
22354042-8	The miR-155-mediated hk2 upregulation also appears to operate in other types of cancer cells examined .	
12419447-5	Cells were treated with the same single or multiple treatments and analyzed in a clonogenic cell survival assay .	
12419447-4	For cell proliferation , cells were counted on Day 4 , and for apoptosis , cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide , then analyzed by FACS .	
12419447-7	Athymic nude mice bearing established s.c. tumor xenografts of 6-8 mm diameter received 6 weeks of treatment with IMC-C225 ( 1 mg every 3 days x 6 ) alone or in combination with gemcitabine ( 120 mg/kg i.v. every 6 days x 6 ) , and 6 weekly fractions of 3 Gy radiation on the days after gemcitabine administration .	
12419447-6	The effect of IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation on the growth of BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor xenografts was determined .	
12419447-1	METHODS AND MATERIALS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were treated in vitro for 24 h with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) , then exposed to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( 10 mM ) for 5 min .	
12419447-0	PURPOSE To investigate treatment of human pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenografts with combinations of Erbitux ( IMC-C225 ) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , gemcitabine , and radiation .	
12419447-3	Cells were treated with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) on Day 0 , the IC(50) dose of gemcitabine on Day 1 for 24 h , followed by 3 Gy 60Co irradiation on Day 2 , or the combination of each agent .	
12419447-2	Immunoblots were screened for EGFR expression and the ability of IMC-C225 to block EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR .	
12419447-9	RESULTS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines expressed low levels of EGFR .	9 93
12419447-8	Tumor growth was measured with Vernier calipers .	
22927647-2	SFRP1 is necessary for stress-induced senescence caused by these factors and is sufficient for the induction of senescence phenotypes .	42 4
22927647-3	We present evidence suggesting that SFRP1 functions as a secreted mediator of senescence through inhibition of Wnt signaling and activation of the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) pathway and that cancer-associated SFRP1 mutants are defective for senescence induction .	42 4
23166510-5	Pachytene piRNA-deficient spermatocytes progress through meiosis without derepression of LINE1 retrotransposons , but become arrested at the post-meiotic round spermatid stage with massive DNA damage .	
23166510-4	Here , we report that conditional inactivation of the putative RNA helicase MOV10L1 in mouse spermatocytes produces a specific loss of pachytene piRNAs , significant accumulation of pachytene piRNA precursor transcripts , and unusual polar conglomeration of Piwi proteins with mitochondria .	
23166510-6	Our results demonstrate that MOV10L1 acts upstream of Piwi proteins in the primary processing of pachytene piRNAs and suggest that , distinct from pre-pachytene piRNAs , pachytene piRNAs fulfill a unique function in maintaining post-meiotic genome integrity .	
22864932-9	On multivariate analysis using a forward stepwise model , TN subtype maintained significance , with an odds ratio of 3.28 ( P = .002 ) .	
22864932-8	On univariate analysis , age , tumor size , margin status , lymphovascular invasion , nodal status , and TN subtype were associated with elevated risk of residual invasive cancer .	11 1
23166510-3	In contrast , pachytene piRNAs originate from genomic clusters , and their biogenesis and function remain enigmatic .	
23304206-0	Retinoic acid ( RA ) has been believed to be an anticancer drug for a long history .	
22499665-2	ChIP-sequencing revealed that by 24 h after expression , e1a erases 95% of H3K18ac peaks in normal , contact-inhibited fibroblasts and replaces them with one-third as many at new genomic locations .	
22499665-3	The H3K18ac peaks at promoters and intergenic regions of genes with fibroblast-related functions are eliminated after infection , and new H3K18ac peaks are established at promoters of highly induced genes that regulate cell cycling and at new putative enhancers .	
22499665-0	Adenovirus small e1a oncoprotein causes reduction in cellular levels of histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation ( H3K18ac ) .	
22337862-1	Part of this variation can be explained by well-recognized short nucleotide contexts , but a large component of this variation remains cryptic .	
22499665-6	The strategic redistribution of H3K18ac by e1a highlights the importance of this modification for transcriptional activation and cellular transformation as well as functional differences between the RB-family member proteins .	
22499665-4	Strikingly , the regions bound by the retinoblastoma family of proteins in contact-inhibited fibroblasts gain new peaks of H3K18ac in the e1a-expressing cells , including 55% of RB1-bound loci .	
22499665-5	In contrast , over half of H3K9ac peaks are similarly distributed before and after infection , independently of RB1 .	
22873102-4	RESULTS TLR-4 was over-expressed in cervix cancer , and its activation by LPS promotes proliferation and anti-apoptosis in Hela cells in vitro .	9 93 81 8
22873102-5	Moreover the cell line proliferation increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner .	9
22873102-6	The production of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 were promoted through the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway .	
22873102-0	OBJECTIVES To investigate the expression of TLR-4 ( toll-like receptor ) on human cervical cancer and find the biological function of the TLR-4 signal system .	
22873102-1	METHODS The immunohistochemistry method was performed to study the protein expression and distribution of TLR-4 .	
22873102-2	The viability of HeLa cells was determined by cell viability assay .	
22864932-4	Molecular phenotypes were defined by conventionally used immunohistochemical pattern .	
22883142-1	Studies of individual loci contributing to these genome-wide average signals are required for characterization of the introgression process and investigation of whether archaic variants conferred an adaptive advantage to the ancestors of contemporary human populations .	
22883142-0	Signals of archaic admixture have been identified through comparisons of the draft Neanderthal and Denisova genomes with those of living humans .	
22883142-7	Although we are not able to pinpoint the precise target of positive selection , we identify nonsynonymous mutations in ERBB3 , ESYT1 , and STAT2-all of which are part of the same 250 kb introgressive haplotype-as good candidates .	
22883142-6	A neutrality test that controls for demography rejects the hypothesis that a variant of N rose to high frequency in Melanesia by genetic drift alone .	
22883142-5	Analyses of publicly available complete genome sequence data show that haplotype N shares a recent common ancestor with the Neanderthal sequence ( thousand years ago ) and is found throughout Eurasia at an average frequency of Interestingly , N is found in Melanesian populations at higher frequency ( than in Eurasian populations .	
19556603-6	This study establishes an important in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis , and elucidates a novel mechanism that causes apoptosis-resistant malignant transformation of nontumorigenic lung cells in response to a human carcinogen .	
19556603-4	Cr(VI)-transformed cells exhibited loss of contact inhibition , colony formation , and increased rates of cell invasion , migration , and proliferation , as compared with passage-matched control cells .	11 1 5 52
19556603-5	Cr(VI)-transformed cells evaded apoptosis by a mechanism involving S-nitrosylation and stabilization of Bcl-2 protein in a nitric oxide-dependent manner .	8 81
19556603-2	Because the lack of a good animal model has hindered the identification of molecular mechanisms involved in Cr(VI) exposure , we developed an in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis .	
19556603-3	We report here that long-term exposure to Cr(VI) leads to the malignant transformation of nontumorigenic human lung epithelial cells .	
19556603-0	Hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) compounds are known human carcinogens associated with the incidence of lung cancer .	
19556603-1	Although a direct correlation between Cr(VI) exposure and lung cancer has been established , several studies aimed at generating animal models for Cr(VI) have yielded inconsistent data that do not affirmatively support findings from epidemiologic studies .	
22848707-2	METHODS AND FINDINGS Using Western blotting and Q-PCR , we found that HIF1A protein is stabilized in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells .	
23211746-1	The common intermediate required to mount a checkpoint response is thought to be single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) , coated by replication protein A ( RPA ) and containing a primer-template junction .	
23211746-0	Lesion-specific enzymes repair different forms of DNA damage , yet all lesions elicit the same checkpoint response .	
23211746-3	We identified Ast1 , a novel member of the XPG-related family of endo/exonucleases .	
23211746-2	To identify factors important for initiating the checkpoint response , we screened for genes that , when overexpressed , could amplify a checkpoint signal to a weak allele of chk1 in fission yeast .	
23211746-5	Each nuclease is recruited to DSBs , and promotes the formation of ssDNA for checkpoint activation and recombinational repair .	612 62 61 6
23211746-4	Ast1 promotes checkpoint activation caused by the absence of the other XPG-related nucleases , Exo1 and Rad2 , the homologue of Fen1 .	
23211746-7	This XPG-related pathway is distinct from MRN-dependent responses , and each enzyme is critical for damage resistance in MRN mutants .	
23211746-6	For Rad2 and Exo1 , this is independent of their S-phase role in Okazaki fragment processing .	
1445801-5	We found that changes in cell plating density and/or medium heparin concentration had variable , inconsistent effects .	
1445801-4	Because heparin preserves FGF biological activity and enhances bFGF binding to high-affinity FGF receptors , we examined the effect of heparin on FGF stimulation of C3 cell thymidine incorporation .	
1445801-7	Binding analyses established that high-affinity bFGF binding of C3 and T5 cells immediately prior to assessing FGF-stimulated thymidine incorporation was comparable and independent of cell plating density , implying that C3 cell FGF insensitivity was not attributable to differences in C3 and T5 cell FGF receptor content at the time of mitogen stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )	
1445801-6	These were C3 cell plating density associated and included inhibition or modest enhancement of FGF effects .	
1445801-1	In contrast , aFGF or bFGF enhancement of C3 cell thymidine incorporation was about 5% of that of T5 cells , and effects were principally mitogen concentration independent .	
1445801-0	Using monolayer cultures of clonally isolated C3 and T5 rat prostate cancer cells , we determined that acidic ( aFGF ) and basic ( bFGF ) fibroblast growth factors profoundly enhanced T5 cell thymidine incorporation with half-maximum stimulation at 0.53 and 0.35 ng/ml , respectively .	
1445801-3	The modest response of C3 cells to either aFGF or bFGF also decreased as cell plating density was reduced .	9 92
1445801-2	Saturation analyses and cross-linking studies established that both C3 and T5 cells contained high-affinity FGF receptors of 120 and 145 kilodaltons and that receptor content and Kd of C3 and T5 cells were comparable. aFGF or bFGF stimulation of T5 cell thymidine incorporation profoundly decreased as cell plating density was reduced from 1.5 x 10(5) to 1.0 x 10(4) cells/well .	
24139416-11	Our results suggested that Lip-mSurvivinT34A induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , thus suppressing tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis .	12 71 1 7 8 81
24139416-10	These responses were associated with tumor cell apoptosis , and angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis inhibition .	8 81 7 71
24139416-12	The mSurvivinT34A survivin mutant is a promising strategy of gene therapy to inhibit lymphatic metastasis .	1 12
23266736-4	Rather , combined treatment with subeffective doses of γ-tocotrienol and sesamin was found to induce G1 cell cycle arrest , and a corresponding decrease in cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 , CDK6 , phospho-Rb , and E2F1 levels , and increase in p27 and p16 levels .	9 51 91 5 511
22389673-3	The aim of this study is to investigate the synergistic effect of sub-lethal doses of ionizing radiation in sensitizing colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis .	
23251422-1	However , the contribution of each of the DSB repair pathways , homologous recombination ( HR ) , non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) and single-strand annealing ( SSA ) , to this sort of genetic instability is not fully understood .	
22936718-9	The results showed that the GBSSI-S locus is the major locus controlling endosperm amylose content , and the GBSSI-L locus has strongly reduced synthesis capacity .	
22936718-8	We evaluated the phenotype of all known GBSSI genotypes in broomcorn millet by assaying starch composition and protein function .	
22936718-7	We first tested the relative contribution of the two GBSSI loci to amylose synthesis and second tested the association between GBSSI alleles and phylogeographic structure inferred from simple sequence repeats ( SSRs ) .	
22936718-6	Previous work characterized two homeologous GBSSI loci , with multiple alleles at each , but could not determine whether both loci contributed to GBSSI function .	
22936718-5	Broomcorn millet is highly unusual in being an allotetraploid cereal with fully waxy varieties .	
22936718-4	Recent phylogeographic analysis has shown strong genetic structuring that likely reflects ancient expansion patterns .	
22936718-3	Broomcorn or proso millet ( Panicum miliaceum L. ) is one of the world's oldest cultivated cereals , which spread across Eurasia early in prehistory .	
22936718-2	The waxy phenotype results from mutations in the GBSSI gene , which catalyzes amylose synthesis .	
22936718-1	The cultivation of waxy varieties is concentrated in east Asia , where there is a culinary preference for glutinous-textured foods that may have developed from ancient food processing traditions .	
22936718-0	Waxy mutants , in which endosperm starch contains amylopectin rather than the wild-type composition of amylopectin and amylose , occur in many domesticated cereals .	
20737228-10	There was a decrease in ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , increased antioxidants and apoptosis in the post initiation phase study .	a21 a2 a 8 81
20737228-11	The present study suggests that FO has a dose- and time-dependent chemopreventive effect in colon cancer mediated through oxidative stress and apoptosis .	a21 a2 a 8 81
23304206-3	Interestingly , RA treatment triggered p35 cleavage ( p25 formation ) and Cdk5 overactivation , and all could be blocked by Calpain inhibitor , Calpeptin ( CP ) .	
23065281-9	Transfection of ZEB1 siRNA into HCC827 cells significantly reduced the ZEB1 protein level ( p<0.01 ) and significantly elevated E-cadherin levels ( p<0.01 ) .	
1330343-1	A proposed hypothesis to explain this relationship is the increased free radical activity observed during retroviral infection and carcinogen activation .	
1330343-0	Retrovirally induced immunosuppression may elevate the incidence of chemically induced cancers .	
1330343-3	This study investigated the contribution that retroviral immunosuppression has on esophageal cancer induced by the carcinogen N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine ( NMBzA ) , and the response that increased levels of dietary vitamin E has on this induced carcinogenesis .	
1330343-2	We previously found that vitamin E retarded growth of esophageal tumors accompanied by reductions of free radical products .	
1330343-5	Then some of the mice were infected with LP-BM5 murine retrovirus and fed diets containing 30 IU vitamin E or 172 IU vitamin E/kg of diet .	
1330343-4	Female C57BL/6 mice received NMBzA or vehicle ( corn oil ) i.p. weekly for 3 weeks .	
1330343-7	Esophagi from the various mice groups were assessed for size and frequency of tumors .	
1330343-6	As an assessment of free radical activity , exhaled ethane was measured prior to killing the animals at 26 weeks .	
1330343-9	Hepatic levels of vitamin A and E were decreased ( P < 0.05 ) and indices of lipid peroxidation were greater ( P < 0.05 ) in NMBzA-treated mice relative to controls .	
1330343-8	Livers homogenates were analyzed for vitamins A and E , lipid fluorescence , conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde .	
23254306-8	Furthermore , the model analyses the relationship between CDK2 and its CKIs ( p21 , p27 ) to help search for other effective ways to bring forward cellular senescence .	51 42 5 4 511
23254306-9	Results show that the degradation rate of p21 and initial concentration of p27 are effective in lowering CDK2 levels to lower the senescence threshold .	51 42 5 4 511
22867999-10	UOK268 provides a unique model of a primary cell line demonstrating an enforced , irreversible Warburg effect and , combined with UOK262 , provides a unique invitro preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer .	31 3
23279696-1	However , multiple isoforms of ALKBH exist and the effect of individual isoforms on the development of urinary bladder cancer is unknown , particularly the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression from a noninvasive to invasive phenotype .	
23279696-0	The ALKBH family of proteins are highly expressed in various types of human cancer where they are involved in tumor growth and progression .	
23279696-3	Moreover , reduction of ALKBH2 suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) via increasing E-cadherin and decreasing vimentin expression .	11 1
23279696-2	We examined the role and function of ALKBH2 in human bladder cancer development in vitro and provide the first report that suppression of ALKBH2 in a human urothelial carcinoma cell line , KU7 , reduced the expression of the transmembrane mucin protein , MUC1 , and induced G1 cell cycle arrest .	9 51 511 5 91
23279696-5	ALKBH2 knockdown significantly suppressed MUC1 expression and tumor volume of bladder cancers in vivo as assessed in an orthotopic mouse model using ALKBH2 shRNA transfected KU7 cells .	
23279696-4	Transfection of MUC1 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and EMT to the same extent as ALKBH2 gene silencing in vitro .	11 1
23279696-7	This study demonstrates that ALKBH2 is an upstream molecule of the oncoprotein , MUC1 , and regulates cell cycle and EMT , resulting in progression of urothelial carcinomas .	11 51 511 1 9 5 91
23279696-6	Immunohistochemical examination showed high expression levels of ALKBH2 in human urothelial carcinoma samples , especially in high-grade , superficially and deeply invasive carcinomas ( pT(1) and >pT(2) ) , and in carcinoma in situ but not in normal urothelium .	
21197417-5	An increase in p21 and cyclin D1 expression occurred in EA.hy926 cells after 6 h of treatment with pIFN-α which dissipated by 24 h .	
21197417-4	Upon combined IFN-α and vinblastine treatment , p21 expression , PARP cleavage and activated Bak levels were increased in M14 cells .	51 5 511 8 81
21197417-7	Exposure of the EA.hy926 cells to pIFN-α was associated with an enlarged , multinucleated , β-galactosidase-positive senescent phenotype .	42 4
21197417-6	This biphasic response , characteristic of cellular senescence , was more pronounced upon combined treatment .	42 4
21197417-1	Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the IFN response , cell cycle and apoptosis .	
21197417-0	Pegylated Interferon-α2b ( pIFN-α ) is an integral part of the drug regimen currently employed against melanoma .	
21197417-3	Levels of IRF-1/IRF-2 protein expression were found to be decreased in tumor versus normal tissues. pIFN-α induced IRF-1 signaling in human melanoma ( M14 ) and endothelial ( EA.hy926 ) cells and enhanced cell death when combined with vinblastine .	
21197417-2	We have studied pIFN-α induced responses when combined with the chemotherapy agent , vinblastine in tumor and endothelial cell lines and the connection to IRF-1 signaling .	
21197417-8	The overall therapeutic mechanism of IFN-α combined with chemotherapy may be due to both direct tumor cell death via IRF-1 signaling and by premature senescence of endothelial cells and subsequent effects on angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment .	42 7 71 4
20336315-6	RESULTS Expression of shRNA targeting PKM2 resulted in inhibition of PKM2 expression in A549 cells .	
20354187-1	It is unclear how different JNK proteins contribute to human cancer .	
20336315-4	In a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model , the effects of treatment with shRNA , with or without cisplatin , on tumor volume were determined .	
20336315-5	Apoptosis and cell proliferation status were examined to determine the mechanisms of tumor growth inhibition .	
20336315-2	METHODS The expression of PKM2 in A549 cells was determined by immunofluorescence .	
20336315-3	PKM2 expression levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis .	
20336315-0	PURPOSE Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis ; inhibition of PKM2 leads to the tumor growth inhibition .	
20354187-0	The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling cascade has been implicated in a wide range of diseases , including cancer .	
12441637-7	However , the AR was higher in HNSCC patients than in the control group , suggesting an increase in the DNA repair capacity in the cancer patients as compared to the control .	62 6
12441637-6	The HNSCC patients in our study showed a significant increase in chromosomal instability after a preterminal exposure of their lymphocytes to either BLM for the last 5 h or DEB for the last 24 h of incubation .	6
12441637-5	The DNA repair capacity was assessed using the DEB-induced adaptive response ( AR ) .	
12441637-4	The chromosomal instability was measured by the number of bleomycin ( BLM)-induced chromosomal aberrations and diepoxybutane ( DEB)-induced sister chromatid exchanges .	
12441637-3	The aim of our study was to search for a correlation between chromosomal instability and DNA repair capacity in HNSCC patients and healthy controls .	
20354187-3	Most importantly , JNK2 , but not JNK1 , is sufficient to couple with oncogenic Ras to transform primary human epidermal cells into malignancy with features of SCC .	
20336315-8	The levels of apoptotic cells were significantly higher in samples from animals in the combined treatment group than those from untreated animals ( P < 0.05 ) .	8 81
20336315-9	The cell proliferation rate , as determined by counting cells labeled with an anti-phospho-histone H3 , a marker for mitosis , was lower in samples from animals treated with both cisplatin and shRNA than in samples from other groups ( P < 0.05 ) .	
22728792-4	This compares to a German EKA value ( exposure equivalent for carcinogenic substances ) for a daily 8-h-exposure to 1 ppm EO of 90 \u03bcg L(-1) blood ( pmol g(-1) globin ) .	
22728792-5	The adduct levels dropped in accordance with the expected zero-order kinetics for a single exposure .	
22728792-6	After the five-month observation interval , the HEV concentrations in blood reflected the individual background from tobacco smoking .	
20354187-2	Here , we report that JNK2 is activated in more than 70% of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) samples and that inhibition of JNK2 pharmacologically or genetically impairs tumorigenesis of human SCC cells .	
22728792-0	An accidental exposure of six workers to ethylene oxide ( EO ) provided the rationale for a biomonitoring and follow-up study , whose aim was to analyse protein adduct kinetics and examine the differentiation between accidental and environmental exposure , e.g. , from tobacco smoke .	
22728792-1	For this purpose , the decrease in the concentration of the haemoglobin adduct N-2-hydroxyethylvaline ( HEV ) was followed during a five-month period after the accident , together with N-2-cyanoethylvaline ( CEV ) and urinary cotinine , two well-established biomarkers for smoking .	
22728792-2	The follow-up study showed that EO adduct concentrations significantly increased after a short but presumably high exposure .	
22728792-3	Initial biomonitoring revealed HEV levels above 500 pmol g(-1) globin in all cases , with a maximum of about 2,400 pmol g(-1) globin .	
22728792-8	Although protein adducts and their occupational-medical assessment values are considered for long-term exposure surveillance , they can also be used for monitoring accidental exposures .	
22728792-9	In these cases , the calculation of daily ' ppm-equivalents ' may provide a means for a comparison with the existing assessment values .	
22919357-4	Onions and garlic have antiradiation potential .	
22919357-3	The protective effect was more potent with 2PTS than NPTS .	
22919357-2	X-ray-induced DNA damage was significantly decreased in both H4IIE and L5178Y cells by micromolar concentrations of NPTS and 2PTS compared with the control without the compounds .	61 6
22919357-1	Cell damage caused by the irradiation was quantified as comet tail moment , which represents the degree of DNA damage .	
22919357-0	To evaluate a radioprotective effect of sodium n-propyl thiosulfate ( NPTS ) and sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate ( 2PTS ) derived from onions and garlic , respectively , rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were preincubated with each of these compounds for 48 hours at 37°C before receiving 10 Gy of X-ray irradiation .	
20354187-6	These data indicate that JNK2 collaborates with other oncogenes , such as Ras , at multiple molecular levels to promote tumorigenesis and hence represents a promising therapeutic target for cancer .	
23304206-2	In this study , the dose-dependent inhibition of RA on DU145 cell proliferation was identified .	
23300781-3	Also , tissue sections were stained with MMP-2 , -9 , -11 , -14 and TIMP-2 antibodies , and immunoreactivity location , percentage of reactive area and intensity were determined at the invasive front and at the tumor center .	
22763381-9	We conclude that the 185delAG* BRCA1 mutation resides on a common haplotype among Ashkenazi Jews , and arose about 61 generations ago and arose independently at least twice in non-Jews .	
23300781-1	The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of the relative amount of macrophages ( CD68⁺ ) , T-cells ( CD3⁺ and B-cells ( CD20⁺ ) at the invasive front of breast carcinomas , and the expression of matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) and their inhibitors ( TIMPs ) either at the invasive front or at the tumor center .	
23300781-0	Tumors are infiltrated by macrophages , T and B-lymphocytes , which may favor tumor development by promoting angiogenesis , growth and invasion .	
23300781-7	Therefore , CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio at the invasive front could be used as an important prognostic marker .	
23300781-6	Multivariate analysis revealed that CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio was an independent factor associated with distant relapse-free survival ( RR : 2.54 , CI : ( 1.23-5.24 ) , p<0.01 ) .	
23300781-5	In addition , a high CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio ( >0.05 ) was directly associated with a higher probability of shortened relapse-free survival .	
22763381-8	The 185delAG mutation in the non-Jewish populations in Malaysia and the UK arose at least twice independently .	
1556770-11	Southern analysis of the three cell lines revealed no consistent loss of loci for the interferon and c-jun genes , although early-passage clone 7 cells had one half the gene copy number for the interferon beta and c-jun genes and both early- and late-passage clone 7 cells lacked DNA sequences hybridizing with the probe for interferon alpha .	
1556770-10	Early-passage clone 7 cells exhibited chromosome 5 monosomy , while late-passage cells contained one normal chromosome 5 and a derivative ( 5q12q ) .	
1556770-12	CONCLUSION This pattern of passage-dependent spontaneous transformation of rat ovarian surface epithelial cells in vitro supports the hypothesis that repetitious ovulation contributes to the etiology of human ovarian cancer .	
23224295-8	We also show novel evidence demonstrating that the pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kγ ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ) with AS252424 , concentration-dependently reduced T24 cell proliferation induced by BK or des-Arg(9)-BK .	
23224295-9	Finally , the incubation of T24 cells with kinin agonists led to a marked activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways , whereas p38 MAP kinase remained unaffected .	921 92 9
22790975-1	One well-accepted mechanism of the dominant inheritance of this disease involves a dominant-negative effect of the mutation on the function of the common-gate of this homodimeric , double-barreled molecule .	
23224295-4	Furthermore , treatment with B(1) and B(2) receptor antagonists ( SSR240612 and HOE140 ) markedly inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells .	9 93
23224295-5	Only higher concentrations of BK increased the proliferation of the grade 1 bladder cancer cell line RT4 , while des-Arg(9)-BK completely failed to induce its proliferation .	
23224295-6	Real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of kinin receptors , particularly B(1) receptors , was increased in T24 cells relative to RT4 cells .	9 93
23224295-7	Data from bladder cancer human biopsies revealed that B(1) receptor expression was increased in all tumor samples and under conditions of chronic inflammation .	9 93 a2 a
23224295-0	Kinins and their receptors have been recently implicated in cancer .	
23224295-1	Using functional and molecular approaches , we investigated the relevance of kinin B(1) and B(2) receptors in bladder cancer .	
23224295-2	Functional studies were conducted using bladder cancer cell lines , and human biopsies were employed for molecular studies .	
23224295-3	Both B(1) des-Arg(9)-BK and B(2) BK receptor agonists stimulated the proliferation of grade 3-derived T24 bladder cancer cells .	9
23121427-3	Here , we present the first nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of a DB[a,l]P-derived adduct , the 14R-(+)-trans-anti-DB[a,l]P-N(2)-dG ( DB[a,l]P-dG ) lesion in double-stranded DNA .	612 611 61 6
23121427-2	The ( +)-11S,12R,13R,14S DE enantiomer forms adducts via its C14 position with the exocyclic amino group of guanine .	
23121427-1	It is metabolically activated in vivo through the widely studied diol epoxide ( DE ) pathway to form covalent adducts with DNA bases , predominantly guanine and adenine .	
23121427-0	The most potent tumorigen identified among the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) is the nonplanar fjord region dibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DB[a,l]P ) .	
23121427-7	The structural considerations that lead to the intercalated conformation of the DB[a,l]P-dG lesion in contrast to the minor groove alignment of the B[a]P-dG adduct , and the implications of the DB[a,l]P-dG conformational motif for the recognition of such DNA lesions by the human nucleotide excision repair apparatus , are discussed .	61 62 611 6
23121427-6	This new theme in PAH DE-DNA adduct conformation differs from ( 1 ) the classical intercalation motif in which Watson-Crick base pairing is intact at the lesion site and ( 2 ) the base-displaced intercalation motif in which the damaged base and its partner are extruded from the helix .	61 611 6
23121427-5	Watson-Crick base pairing of the modified guanine with the partner cytosine is broken , but these bases retain some stacking with the bulky DB[a,l]P ring system .	
23121427-4	In contrast to the stereochemically identical benzo[a]pyrene-derived N(2)-dG adduct ( B[a]P-dG ) in which the B[a]P rings reside in the B-DNA minor groove on the 3'-side of the modifed deoxyguanosine , in the DB[a,l]P-derived adduct the DB[a,l]P rings intercalate into the duplex on the 3'-side of the modified base from the sterically crowded minor groove .	61 611 6
23304206-7	This finding may contribute to constructing a clearer image of RA function and bring RA as a valuable chemoprevention agent for prostate cancer patients .	
12674770-3	Ad-p53 could induce apoptosis of partial EJ cells .	8 81
12674770-2	Ad-p16 or Ad-p53 alone could inhibit the proliferating activity of EJ cells in vitro .	
12674770-1	Cell growth , morphological change , cell cycle , apoptosis were measured using MTT assay , flow cytometry , cloning formation , immunocytochemical assays .	
12674770-0	To evaluate the effects of adenovirus ( Ad)-mediated transfer of p53 and p16 on human bladder cancer cells EJ , EJ were transfected with Ad-p53 and Ad-p16 .	
12674770-7	It was suggested that the transfer of wild-type p53 and p16 could significantly inhibit the growth of human bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo .	
12674770-6	The occurrence time of subcutaneous tumor was delayed and the tumor volume in 4 weeks was diminished by using Ad-p53 combined with Ad-p16 and the difference was significant compared with using Ad-p53 or Ad-p16 alone .	
12674770-5	The transfer of Ad-p16 and Ad-p53 could significantly inhibit the growth of EJ cells , decrease the cloning formation rate and induce apoptosis of large number of EJ cells .	8 81
12674770-4	G1 arrest was observed 72 h after infection with Ad-p16 , but apoptosis was not obvious .	51 5 511 8 81
23137061-9	During arsenite exposure , expression of several genes associated with normal kidney development and SC regulation and differentiation ( i.e. , Wt-1 , Wnt-4 , Bmp-7 , etc. ) were aberrantly altered .	
22790975-7	Overall , the mutant could lead to a significantly reduced dynamic response of CLC-1 to membrane depolarization , from a fivefold increase in chloride conductance in the wild type to a twofold increase in the mutant-this might result in slower membrane repolarization during an action potential .	
23219753-9	Finally , immunohistochemical staining , indirect immunofluorescence , and Western blotting analysis of human aggressive OCSCC specimens revealed a significantly positive correlation between Rap-1A and Aurora-A expression .	
23219753-8	Furthermore , our data also illustrated that Aurora-A could not only induce mRNA and protein expressions of Rap-1A for enhancing cancer cell motility but also co-localize and form a complex with Rap-1A in the oral cancer cell line .	
21063097-11	The IR-stimulated accumulation in G(2) phase was delayed upon buffering [ Ca(2+)](i) with the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM or inhibiting CaMKII with KN93 ( 1 nM ) .	
21063097-10	Ca(2+) entry , into K562 cells was paralleled by an IR-induced activation of nuclear CaMKII .	
21116849-7	This study suggests that caffeine might not enhance radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in vivo .	
21116849-6	Caffeine did not enhance apoptosis , transaminase activity , or histopathological injury of normal rat liver tissue at any time points after IR .	8 81
21116849-5	Caffeine abrogated IR-induced G2 phase arrest ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 40.9 ± 4.0 vs. 60.7 ± 5.5% , at 12 h after IR ) and increased apoptosis rates ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 56.1 ± 6.8 vs. 35.5 ± 4.0% , at 72 h after IR ) in McA-RH7777 cells , but did not affect IR-induced G2 phase arrest and apoptosis rates at any time point after IR in BRL3A cells .	9 51 511 5 91 8 81
21116849-4	Transaminase activity was measured and histopathological examination was done after IR .	
21116849-3	Apoptosis rates in normal rat liver tissue after IR were evaluated by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 Western blot .	8 81
21116849-2	A rat model of radiation-induced liver disease was established , rats were randomized into four groups : control ; caffeine alone ; irradiation ( IR ) alone ; and caffeine plus IR ( Caff + IR ) group .	
21116849-1	Buffalo rat McA-RH7777 hepatocellular cancer cells and BRL3A normal liver cells were irradiated , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rates were analyzed .	
21116849-0	The aim of this study was to determine whether caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in a rat radiation-induced liver disease model .	
21116849-9	Together , these results offer feasibility of clinical application .	
21116849-8	In an earlier study , we reported that caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of human hepatocellular cancer in a nude mice model .	
11836618-12	Moreover , overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 in preinvasive , preinvasive and adjacent invasive lesions , and invasive carcinomas suggest that the gene may play an important role in early and late stages of breast carcinogenesis .	11 91 1 9
11836618-11	These observations indicate that amplification and up-regulation of cyclin D1 may be independent of patient age .	
11836618-10	Although majority of the Malaysian patients belong to younger age group ( <50 years old ) , amplification and expression of cyclin D1 was not statistically associated with patient age ( p>0.05 ) .	
12509295-0	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Mre11p , Rad50p , and Xrs2p function as a multiprotein complex that has a central role in several DNA repair mechanisms .	
12509295-1	Though Mre11p has both single-stranded and double-stranded 3'-5 ' exonuclease activity in vitro , null mutants of MRE11 , RAD50 , and XRS2 exhibit reduced 5'-3 ' resection of HO-induced double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in vivo .	
12509295-2	In this study , we analyzed four mre11 mutants harboring changes in the N-terminus of Mre11p where the four phosphoesterase motifs specify the in vitro nuclease activities of Mre11p and its homologues .	
12509295-3	We find that the 5'-3 ' resection defects in vivo do not correlate with several mitotic phenotypes : non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) , telomere length maintenance , and adaptation to the DNA damage-inducible G2/M checkpoint .	61 62 6
12509295-4	Overexpression of the 5'-3 ' exonuclease Exo1p in a mre11Delta strain partially increased 5'-3 ' resection and partially suppressed both methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) hypersensitivity and adaptation phenotypes , but did not affect telomere length or NHEJ .	62 4 6
12509295-5	Surprisingly , the co-expression of two alleles , mre11-58S and mre11-N113S , each of which confers MMS hypersensitivity and short telomeres , can fully complement the MMS sensitivity and shortened telomere length of mre11Delta cells .	
12509295-6	We propose that at least two separate activities associated with the N-terminus of Mre11p are required for its mitotic function .	
22763445-2	As shown in cancer cells , human telomerase binds the shelterin component TPP1 at telomeres during the S phase of the cell cycle , and adds nucleotides in a single round of extension , after which telomerase is turned off by unknown mechanisms .	
22763445-3	Here we show that the human CST ( CTC1 , STN1 and TEN1 ) complex , previously implicated in telomere protection and DNA metabolism , inhibits telomerase activity through primer sequestration and physical interaction with the protection of telomeres 1 ( POT1)–TPP1 telomerase processivity factor .	
22763445-0	The lengths of human telomeres , which protect chromosome ends from degradation and end fusions , are crucial determinants of cell lifespan .	
22763445-1	During embryogenesis and in cancer , the telomerase enzyme counteracts telomeric DNA shortening .	
22763445-6	We propose that through binding of the telomerase-extended telomere , CST limits telomerase action at individual telomeres to approximately one binding and extension event per cell cycle .	
22763445-7	Our findings define the sequence of events that occur to first enable and then terminate telomerase-mediated telomere elongation .	
22763445-4	CST competes with POT1–TPP1 for telomeric DNA , and CST–telomeric-DNA binding increases during late S/G2 phase only on telomerase action , coinciding with telomerase shut-off .	
22763445-5	Depletion of CST allows excessive telomerase activity , promoting telomere elongation .	
22842620-5	TSHR protein expression was generally overexpressed in multiple thoracic malignancies ( adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma and malignant pleural mesothelioma ) by immunohistochemistry .	
22534171-14	The same regulation was observed in ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells .	
23304206-5	Furthermore , RA-triggered caspase 3 activation and following Cdk5 over-activation were destroyed by treatments of both CP and Cdk5 knockdown .	8 81
22534171-15	Interestingly , we observed that both flTF and asTF could be regulated in a parallel manner in MDA-MB-231 .	
20422883-4	RESULTS 50 microM progesterone increased both the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of 0.1 microg/ml epirubicin on HepG2 cells at 48 hr culture due to 50 microM progesterone accumulated cells in S phase of the cell cycle and subsequently reduced cyclin D1 expression .	81 9 91 8 92
20422883-5	These effects on HepG2 cells induced by this combination were comparable to those induced by 0.5 microg/ml epirubicin alone .	
20422883-6	CONCLUSIONS In vitro , progesterone can increase the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by epirubicin on HepG2 cells .	
23255900-6	Combined treatment was found to increase CTL cytotoxicity , increase the number of CTLs and NK cells in splenocytes , upregulate the cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 and downregulate IL-10 .	
20422883-0	BACKGROUND/AIMS The use of chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still controversial .	
20422883-1	The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combined use of epirubicin and progesterone has a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells .	
20422883-2	METHODOLOGY Different concentrations of epirubicin ( 0.1 microg/ml , 0.25 microg/ml and 0.5microg/ml ) or progesterone ( 12.5 microM , 25 microM and 50 microM ) were added to HepG2 cells either alone or in combinations consisting of different concentrations of the two .	
20422883-3	Their effects on HepG2 cells were studied by ( 1 ) XTT assay for analysis of cell proliferation , ( 2 ) 3H-Thymidine incorporation for DNA synthesis , ( 3 ) annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide ( PI ) flowcytometery for cell apoptosis , ( 4 ) flowcytometry for cell cycle distributions , and ( 5 ) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for expression of cell cycle modulator , cyclin D1 .	
23011762-10	This study suggests that HNPs 1-3 promote tumor invasion and are potential indicators of disease progression in patients with bladder cancer .	11 1
1332809-4	For these reasons , a complete tumor resection would be necessary to improve the immunocompetence , and the combined splenectomy might be advisable if indicated .	
20693267-8	High intake of n-6 fatty acids , through their effects on inflammation and oxidative stress , may increase prostate cancer risk .	a21 a2 a
1332809-3	As a rule , AGC would weaken immune function of patients , and along with the development of the tumor , the immunosuppression in the spleen would be generated gradually .	2 22
1332809-0	The immune status of spleen and the effect of surgical treatment in advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) patients were evaluated by means of testing NK cell activity , T-lymphocyte subsets and circulating immune complex ( CIC ) .	
1332809-1	The results showed ( 1 ) the significant impairment of NK cell activity and T-lymphocyte subsets , were decreased in CD3+ , CD4+ cells and increased in CD6+ cells resulting in CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) , splenic venous blood lymphocytes ( SVL ) and spleen cells ( SC ) of AGC , as compared with PBL of normal population ; ( 2 ) NK cell activity or CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio of SVL and SC were significantly lower than those of PBL in AGC patients , mainly caused by marked decrease of CD4+ cells in SC ; ( 3 ) NK cell activity , CD4+ cells and CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio were significantly elevated in most of AGC cases receiving either radical gastrectomy ( R2+ ) or extensive radical gastrectomy ( R3 ) .	2 21
22927647-0	Cellular senescence has emerged as a critical tumor suppressive mechanism in recent years , but relatively little is known about how senescence occurs .	
22564725-3	After antiestrogen treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells , cyclin E2 mRNA and protein were downregulated and cyclin E2-CDK2 activity decreased .	91 9
22927647-1	Here , we report that secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 ( SFRP1 ) , a secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling , is oversecreted upon cellular senescence caused by DNA damage or oxidative stress .	a21 42 61 a2 a 6 4
23180582-8	Altogether , these data demonstrate that induction of senescence , coupled with immune surveillance , can limit melanoma growth .	42 4
23251606-7	Taken together , our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP and the underlying mechanisms against myeloma cancer cells .	
23180582-4	Importantly , when a subset of tumour-bearing mice were monitored for tumour progression after pausing MLN8054 treatment , 50% of the tumours did not progress over a 12-month period .	
23180582-5	Mechanistic analyses revealed that inhibition of aurora kinases induced polyploidy and the ATM/Chk2 DNA damage response , which mediated senescence and a NF-κB-related , senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) .	61 42 4 6
23180582-6	Blockade of IKKβ/NF-κB led to reversal of MLN8237-induced senescence and SASP .	42 4
23180582-7	Results demonstrate that removal of senescent tumour cells by infiltrating myeloid cells is crucial for inhibition of tumour re-growth .	42 4
23180582-0	Oncogene-induced senescence can provide a protective mechanism against tumour progression .	
23180582-1	However , production of cytokines and growth factors by senescent cells may contribute to tumour development .	
23180582-2	Thus , it is unclear whether induction of senescence represents a viable therapeutic approach .	
23180582-3	Here , using a mouse model with orthotopic implantation of metastatic melanoma tumours taken from 19 patients , we observed that targeting aurora kinases with MLN8054/MLN8237 impaired mitosis , induced senescence and markedly blocked proliferation in patient tumour implants .	42 4
21541970-2	This research studied leptin-induced signaling and apoptosis in androgen sensitive ( LNCaP , PC3/AR ) and insensitive ( PC3 , DU145 ) PCa cell lines .	
21541970-3	METHODS Signaling was studied by immunoblotting in cells overexpressing leptin receptors ( LRb ) , Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) , and kinase negative-HER2-YFP cDNAs .	
20573279-10	Consequently , HB-19 could provide a novel therapeutic agent by itself or as an adjuvant therapy in association with current therapeutic interventions on a virulent cancer like melanoma .	
21541970-1	One such factor affecting growth , proliferation , and apoptostis ( pro-/anti- ) in various cancers is the adipokine leptin .	
21541970-6	Leptin was then shown to exert clear pro-apoptotic effects , increasing levels of caspase 3 , cleavage of its substrate , poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) to cleaved PARP(89) , levels of CK 18 , a cytoskeletal protein formed during apoptosis , and DNA condensation .	8 81
21541970-7	Kinase inhibitors indicated that leptin-induced apoptosis is probably mediated by balanced activation of JAK2/STAT3 , p38 MAPK , and PKC pathways in PCa cells .	921 92 9
20878069-9	EGF was found to be down-regulated in long-term survivors .	9 92
20878069-8	We found also an upregulation of CYP1A1 , CYP3A4 and ERBB4 genes .	
20878069-7	Expression analysis in long-term survivors revealed a significant upregulation of PTEN , TP63 , GADD45a and MAPK1 genes .	921 92 9
20878069-6	Genetic polymorphism analysis on DNA extracted from peripheral blood was done by pyrosequencing of genetic markers predictive of drug response .	
20878069-5	Expression profiling from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues was performed on an ad hoc set of genes involved in drug metabolism and resistance , DNA repair , cell cycle regulation and growth factors signalling .	9 62 92 6
20878069-4	Four patients with typical clinical outcome represented the control group .	
20878069-3	We present herein an analysis of genetic and expression profiling of three patients affected by metastatic gastric cancer , treated with CT and alive , disease-free , at 66-82 months .	
20878069-2	The possibility to classify patients on the basis of genetic signatures could help in choosing the CT regimen .	
20878069-1	Genetic polymorphisms and differences at the level of transcription in genes involved in biological processes of drug metabolism , DNA repair and drug resistance can explain the observed individual differences in response to drugs , in survival and in different susceptibility to the toxic effects of CT .	
20878069-0	Current palliative chemotherapy ( CT ) regimens achieve clinical benefits in less than 50% of patients treated for metastatic gastric cancers , and long-term survivals are anecdotical .	
23251606-0	Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a clonal disease of plasma cells that remains incurable despite the advent of several novel therapeutics .	
23317200-6	Moreover , luteolin downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 , survivin and c-myc , and it also upregulated the expression of p53 , in line with the fact that luteolin was able to inhibit Eca109 cell proliferation .	9
23232625-2	Here we identify the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) antagonist Sprouty2 ( Spry2 ) as a key player in mediating endothelial quiescence and barrier integrity in mouse aortic endothelial cells ( MAECs ) : Spry2 knockout MAECs show spindle-like shapes and are incapable of forming a functional , impermeable endothelial monolayer in the presence of FGF2 .	
22936718-15	Partially waxy phenotypes were probably selected against-this unexpected finding shows that better understanding is needed of the human biology of this phenomenon that distinguishes cereal use in eastern and western cultures .	
22936718-14	Mutant alleles show some exchange between genetic groups , which was favored by selection for the waxy phenotype in particular regions .	
22936718-13	Our data suggest that broomcorn millet is a system in the process of becoming diploidized for the GBSSI locus responsible for grain amylose .	
22936718-12	The combination of alleles that results in a partially waxy phenotype does not exist in landrace populations .	
22936718-11	We found that GBSSI alleles have distinct spatial distributions and strong associations with particular genetic clusters defined by SSRs .	
22936718-10	We genotyped 178 individuals from landraces from across Eurasia for the 2 GBSSI and 16 SSR loci and analyzed phylogeographic structuring and the geographic and phylogenetic distribution of GBSSI alleles .	
23219753-10	Taken together , our results suggest that the Aurora-A/Rap-1A pathway is associated with survival , tumor progression , and metastasis of OCSCC patients .	1 12
12450390-9	Mutation frequencies for dG-AF were 9.3-21% , the higher value at G(2) .	63 6
12450390-8	Mutation frequencies for dG-AAF were 9.4-24% , the highest values being at G(1) and G(3) .	63 6
23232625-3	Whereas dense wild type cells exhibit contact inhibition and stop to proliferate , Spry2 knockout MAECs remain responsive to FGF2 and continue to proliferate even at high cell densities .	
12450390-5	The mutational frequency varied , depending on the position modified in the Nar I site ; 91% two-base deletions were observed at G(3) , while 8.4% and 2.8% deletions were detected at G(2) and G(1) , respectively .	63 6
12450390-4	In SOS-induced E. coli , dG-AAF primarily induced one- and two-base deletions .	63 6
12450390-7	In COS-7 cells , both dG-AAF and dG-AF primarily induced G --> T transversions .	63 6
12450390-6	In contrast , dG-AF at any position in the Nar I site failed to produce deletions , generating primarily G --> T transversions ( mutational frequency , 7.6-8.4% ) .	63 6
12450390-1	Oligodeoxynucleotides ( (5)(')TCCTCG(1)G(2)CG(3)CCTCTC ) containing a recognition sequence for the Nar I restriction enzyme were modified site-specifically with dG-AAF or dG-AF .	
12450390-0	Comparative mutagenesis studies of N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene ( dG-AAF ) and N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene ( dG-AF ) adducts positioned in the Nar I restriction enzyme site were performed using Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and simian kidney ( COS-7 ) cells .	
12450390-3	Following replication in host cells , progeny plasmids were recovered and analyzed for mutations .	
12450390-2	Modified and unmodified oligomers inserted into single-stranded phagemid shuttle vectors were used to transform E. coli or to transfect COS-7 cells .	
23085987-5	Together , our data indicate a novel role of Wig1 in RISC target accessibility , which is a key step in RNA-mediated gene silencing .	
23085987-4	Wig1 plays an essential role in cell proliferation , as demonstrated in tumour xenografts in mice , and Wig1 and p21 mRNA levels are inversely correlated in human normal and cancer tissues .	
23085987-6	In addition , these findings indicate that fine-tuning of p21 levels by Wig1 is essential for the prevention of cellular senescence .	42 4
23085987-1	Here , we demonstrate that Wig1 plays a critical role in this process through regulation of p21 mRNA stability .	
23085987-0	Premature senescence , a key strategy used to suppress carcinogenesis , can be driven by p53/p21 proteins in response to various stresses .	
23085987-3	Depletion of Wig1 prohibited miRNA-mediated p21 mRNA decay and resulted in premature senescence .	42 4
23085987-2	Wig1 controls the association of Argonaute2 ( Ago2 ) , a central component of the RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , with target p21 mRNA via binding of the stem-loop structure near the microRNA ( miRNA ) target site .	
22870112-10	It may be used to identify children at the highest risk for these cancers and aid in determing who may benefit most from preventive strategies .	
22870112-11	Given the small number of children in our study , studies with larger populations are required to confirm these results .	
22876840-9	RESULTS miR-196a was highly expressed both in NSCLC samples and cell lines compared with their corresponding normal counterparts , and the expression of miR-196a may be affected by DNA demethylation .	
20354842-1	TRAIL activates DR4 and DR5 and thereby triggers apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways , but possible different roles of DR4 or DR5 in these responses has poorly been addressed so far .	
20354842-0	Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) and agonistic anti-DR4/TRAIL-R1 and anti-DR5/TRAIL-R2 antibodies are currently under clinical investigation for treatment of different malignancies .	
20354842-3	We found that all three reagents are able to activate cell death and pro-inflammatory signaling .	8 a2 a
20354842-2	In the present work , we analyzed cell viability , DISC formation as well as IL-8 and NF-kappaB activation side by side in responses to TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against DR4 ( mapatumumab ) and against DR5 ( lexatumumab ) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells .	
20354842-5	Notably , blocking of receptors using DR4- and DR5-specific Fab fragments indicated that TRAIL exerted its function predominantly via DR4 .	
20354842-4	Death-inducing signaling complex ( DISC ) analysis revealed that mapatumumab and lexatumumab induce formation of homocomplexes of either DR4 or DR5 , whereas TRAIL additionally stimulated the formation of heterocomplexes of both receptors .	
20354842-7	Our results suggest the existence of mechanisms that silence DR5 for TRAIL- but not for agonistic-antibody treatment .	
20354842-6	Interestingly , inhibition of PKC by Goe6983 enabled DR5 to trigger apoptotic signaling in response to TRAIL and also strongly enhanced lexatumumab-mediated cell death .	8 81
23111389-3	Lung metastasis assays were performed in a mouse metastatic model , and it was found that expression of miR-93 promoted tumor cell metastasis to lung tissue .	
23180966-11	Further studies are needed to confirm our results .	
21982881-1	We compared BARD1 recruitment at these structures using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays to measure YFP-BARD1 dynamics in live cells .	
20693267-2	Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and a structured supplement-use questionnaire .	
20067526-4	Overexpression of PRC and ERRalpha led to increased respiratory chain capacity and mitochondrial mass .	
20067526-7	We therefore hypothesize that the ERRalpha-PRC complex plays a role in arresting the cell cycle through the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in oxidative cells , and through some other pathway in glycolytic cells .	31 3
20067526-6	However , the inhibition of PRC and ERRalpha produced a greater effect in the oxidative cell model , decreasing the mitochondrial mass and the phosphorylating respiration , whereas the nonphosphorylating respiration remained unchanged .	
20067526-1	The nuclear transcriptional factors , estrogen-related receptor alpha ( ERRalpha ) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 , are associated with the coordination of the transcriptional machinery governing mitochondrial biogenesis , whereas coactivators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 ( PGC-1 ) family serve as mediators between the environment and this machinery .	
20067526-0	Mitochondrial biogenesis , which depends on nuclear as well as mitochondrial genes , occurs in response to increased cellular ATP demand .	
20067526-3	We explored three thyroid cell lines , FTC-133 , XTC.UC1 and RO 82 W-1 , each characterized by a different mitochondrial content , and studied their behavior towards PRC and ERRalpha in terms of respiratory efficiency .	
20067526-2	In the context of proliferating cells , PGC-1-related coactivator ( PRC ) is a member of the PGC-1 family , which is known to act in partnership with nuclear respiratory factors , but no functional interference between PRC and ERRalpha has been described so far .	
23232625-6	Spry2 protein expression is barely detectable in single cells but steadily increases in cells growing to high cell densities , with hypoxia being one contributing factor .	
23383661-1	In this study , we examined the effects of genomic changes in HBV of genotype C2 on the development of HCC .	
23513490-4	One case presented with symptoms of cavernous sinus invasion and panhypopituitarism and the other case with diabetes insipidus .	
23383661-0	The effects of genomic changes in hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) on the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) are still unclear , especially in relation to the genotype of HBV .	
19637241-4	Biochemical serum testing revealed potential liver dysfunction with hypercholesterolemia in Nucling-KO males .	
19637241-5	In the background of Nucling-KO mice , we observed the up-regulation of TNFalpha , spontaneous NF-kappaB-activation and the induction of galectin-3 expression in liver .	
20332304-10	AOM + DSS-treated mice had 2.4 +/- 0.7 tumors per animal compared with AOM + DSS + 300 ppm resveratrol , which had 0.2 +/- 0.13 tumors per animal .	
20332304-11	The current study indicates that resveratrol is a useful , nontoxic complementary and alternative strategy to abate colitis and potentially colon cancer associated with colitis .	
19637241-0	Nucling is a stress-inducible protein associated with apoptosomes .	
19637241-1	The cytochrome c-triggered formation of apoptosomes represents a key-initiating event in apoptosis .	
20693267-3	Cancer was detected in 1,703 men ; 127 cancers were high-grade ( Gleason score 8-10 ) .	
23111389-1	We stably expressed miR-93 in the MT-1 human breast carcinoma cell line and found that tumors formed by the miR-93 cells contained more blood vessels than those formed by the control cells .	
23142370-3	The MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect .	
23142370-2	This study aims to check if lycopodine has demonstrable anti-cancer effects and if it has , to find out the possible mechanism of its action .	
23142370-1	To combat this situation , lycopodine , a pharmacologically important bioactive component derived from Lycopodium clavatum spores , was tested against hormone sensitive ( LnCaP ) and refractory ( PC3 ) prostate cancer cells in vitro .	
23142370-0	When the prostate cancer cells become unresponsive to androgen therapy , resistance to chemotherapy becomes imminent , resulting in high mortality .	
23142370-7	CD spectroscopic analysis revealed intercalating property of lycopodine with DNA molecule , implicating its ability to block cellular DNA synthesis .	
23142370-6	Administration of lycopodine down-regulated the expression of 5-lipoxygenase and the 5-oxo-ETE receptor ( OXE receptor1 ) and EGF receptor , and caused up-regulation of cytochrome c with depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential , without palpable change in p53 activity , resulting in apoptosis , cell arrest at G0/G1 stage and ultimately reduced proliferation of cancer cells ; concomitantly , there was externalization of phosphotidyl serine residues .	91 81 9 8
23142370-5	Drug-DNA interaction was determined by CD spectroscopy .	
23142370-4	Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential , cell cycle , EGF receptor activity and apoptosis were recorded by FACS ; profiles of different anti- and pro-apoptotic genes and their products were studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR , indirect-ELISA , western blotting .	
22692904-11	The association between SR levels and response to PI3K inhibition might open new avenues for the treatment of tumors overexpressing this receptor .	
22692904-10	Because of the link between SR and PI3K/AKT signaling , tumor cells expressing high levels of the receptor ( MENX-associated primary pheochromocytoma and NCI-H727 human bronchopulmonary carcinoid cells ) respond well and in a SR-dependent manner to PI3K inhibitors , such as NVP-BEZ235 .	9 93
23513490-5	Both patients had a rapid progression of their disease despite chemotherapy and died after a few months .	
22301190-5	Treatment with anti-miR-34a inhibitor relieved the expression of IMPDH upon DNA damage .	61 6
22301190-4	Here we demonstrated that p53-inducible microRNA-34a ( miR-34a ) repressed inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) , a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo GTP biosynthesis .	
22301190-7	In summary , we suggest that p53 has a novel function in regulating purine biosynthesis , aided by miR-34a-dependent IMPDH repression .	
22301190-6	Ultimately , miR-34a-mediated inhibition of IMPDH resulted in repressed activation of the GTP-dependent Ras signaling pathway .	
22301190-1	Moreover , p53 regulates glucose metabolism and its mutation results in the metabolic switch to the Warburg effect found in cancer cells .	
22301190-0	p53 is a well-known transcription factor that controls cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to a wide range of stresses .	
22301190-3	Nonetheless , little is known about whether p53 regulates nucleotide biosynthesis .	
22301190-2	Nucleotide biosynthesis is also critical for cell proliferation and the cell division cycle .	
23280187-8	In addition , treating AMC-HN-3 cells with LKB1 siRNA preserved cell viability against β-catenin silencing-induced cytotoxicity .	
23280187-9	Taken together , these results imply that following β-catenin silencing , HNSCC undergo both apoptotic and autophagic cell death that are under the control of LKB1/AMPK .	82 81 8
24186204-6	Our results point to a new therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancers targeted to the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway for abrogating EMT and attenuating cancer stem cells , which evade conventional therapies .	11 1 12
24186204-7	We report a novel regulatory mechanism by which low mtDNA content generates EMT and cancer stem cells in hMECs.Oncogene advance online publication , 4 November 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.467 .	
20693267-0	The authors examined nutritional risk factors for prostate cancer among 9,559 participants in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ( United States and Canada , 1994-2003 ) .	
24186204-1	The mechanistic link between mtDNA ( mitochondrial DNA ) reduction , often seen in breast cancer patients , and EMT is unknown .	
24186204-2	We demonstrate that reducing mtDNA content in human mammary epithelial cells ( hMECs ) activates Calcineurin ( Cn)-dependent mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway , which induces EMT-like reprogramming to fibroblastic morphology , loss of cell polarity , contact inhibition and acquired migratory and invasive phenotype .	11 1 5 52
21063097-0	Genotoxic stress induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair which may enable tumor cells to survive radiation therapy .	
23280187-0	The Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates the viability and radiosensitivity of head and neck squamous cancer cells ( HNSCC ) .	
23280187-1	Increased β-catenin predisposes HNSCC patients to poor prognosis and survival .	
23280187-2	This study was conducted to determine the mechanism by which β-catenin regulates the viability of HNSCC .	
23280187-3	AMC-HN-3 , -HN-8 , UM-SCC-38 , and -SCC-47 cells , which were established from human head and neck cancer specimens , underwent cell death following β-catenin silencing. β-Catenin silencing significantly induced G1 arrest and increased the expression of Bax and active caspase-3 , which demonstrates the sequential activation of apoptotic cascades following treatment of HNSCC with targeted siRNA .	
23280187-4	Intriguingly , β-catenin silencing also induced autophagy .	82 8
23280187-5	Here , we confirm that the number of autophagic vacuoles and the expression of type II light chain 3 were increased in cells that were treated with β-catenin siRNA .	82 8
23280187-6	These cell death modes are most likely due to the activation of LKB1-dependent AMPK following β-catenin silencing .	
23280187-7	The activated LKB1/AMPK pathway in AMC-HN-3 cells caused G1 arrest by phosphorylating p53 and suppressing mTOR signaling .	
22888341-12	N-desulfated heparin can inhibit the metastasis of gastric cancer through inhibiting tumor bFGF expression and tumor angiogenesis with no obvious anticoagulant activity .	12 7 711 1 71
23205094-10	In conclusion , MSCs are resistant to the hypoxia-induced desensitization to β2AR .	
23205094-11	Hypoxia caused a siginificant desensitization of the β2AR in COS1NR cells alone , whereas MSCs may support tumor progression through cellular interactions .	
20100566-5	Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation stimulation was dependent on the presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin in the photoactivated MVP .	
20100566-4	Cells treated with photoactivated MVP showed strongly stimulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation , an early DNA-damage response in mammals .	61 6
20693267-1	The presence or absence of cancer was determined by prostate biopsy , which was recommended during the trial because of an elevated prostate-specific antigen level or an abnormal digital rectal examination and was offered to all men at the trial's end .	
20100566-6	It did not occur in the presence of a specific PARP inhibitor nor in mouse fibroblasts deficient in PARP-1 .	
22949905-11	Nevertheless , from our perspective the combination of FOLFIRI and cetuximab is quite a promising therapeutic option for patients with metastatic anal cancer .	1 12
22949905-10	The patient died 21 months after diagnosis because of liver failure .	
20100566-3	We found that photoactivation of MVP and the resulting peroxide production were time-dependent and required the simultaneous presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin .	
22949905-12	Potential predictive factors of the immunochemotherapy are discussed in this paper .	
21063097-6	In addition , the effect of IR ( 5 Gy ) on the cation conductance of primary CML cells was determined .	
20100566-9	Finally , photoactivated MVP was shown to be toxic to human cells and induced caspase-independent cell death .	8 81
20100566-8	The presence of double-strand breaks was further confirmed using a 53PB1 focus analysis .	612 61 6
22848707-5	Using biochemical assays and Q-PCR , we also found that lymphoblastoid cells produce high levels of lactate , lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate .	31 3
22848707-4	Immunostaining and Q-PCR showed that the stabilized HIF1A translocates to the nucleus , forms a heterodimer with ARNT , and transactivates several genes involved in aerobic glycolysis .	31 3
22499665-1	It is unclear , however , where this dramatic reduction occurs genome-wide .	
22848707-1	The role of HIF1A in EBV-induced B-cell immortalization has not been previously studied .	
22848707-0	BACKGROUND Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) encodes six nuclear transformation-associated proteins that induce extensive changes in cellular gene expression and signaling and induce B-cell transformation .	
22848707-3	Western blotting , GST pulldown assays , and immunoprecipitation showed that EBV-encoded nuclear antigens EBNA-5 and EBNA-3 bind to prolylhydroxylases 1 and 2 , respectively , thus inhibiting HIF1A hydroxylation and degradation .	
1399111-10	The multiplicity of factors required by cancer cells for dissemination helps to explain the minute fraction of cancer cells from a primary tumor that ever develop into a metastasis .	1 12
20377132-10	Treatment with p38 inhibitor rescued some cells from MG132-induced apotposis , which was not affected by ROS and GSH level changes .	
22318307-5	D-Limonene treatment also extended the latency period of tumor development from 4 to 9 weeks .	
22318307-4	In a two-stage skin tumorigenesis study , D-limonene significantly reduced the tumor burden ( p < 0.005 ) and tumor incidence as compared to DMBA/TPA-treated mice .	
22318307-7	A decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax expression were also observed in tumor tissues of mice treated with D-limonene .	8 81
22318307-6	D-Limonene treatment decreased the expression level of Ras , Raf and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 in DMBA/TPA-induced tumors .	
22318307-1	In the present study , we have investigated the effects of D-limonene on the growth of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-promoted skin tumor development .	
22318307-0	D-Limonene , a common monoterepene has been shown to have antiproliferative , apoptosis-inducing and chemopreventive effects .	
22318307-3	In addition , treatment of D-limonene effectively restored the level of reduced glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione S-transferase , catalase and malondialdehyde production in TPA-treated mouse skin .	a21 a2 a
21203561-10	We anticipate that this interaction between an RTK and a component of NFκB signaling will not be limited to FGFR4 alone .	
22848179-8	RESULTS The nanofibers induced different responses according to the cell type used .	
22318307-8	Taken together , our findings suggest that D-limonene may exert its chemopreventive activity through the inhibition of inflammation , oxidative stress and Ras-signaling as well as the induction of pro-apoptotic state during TPA-mediated promotion of DMBA-induced skin cancer in mouse model .	a21 a2 a 8 81
22848179-9	In plant cells , the most genotoxic nanofibers were those derived from green , white , and brown cotton , and curaua , while genotoxicity in animal cells was observed using nanofibers from brown cotton and curaua .	6
12041507-5	Furthermore , dissociation between IgG and TGF- resulted in a loss of the suppressive activity of plasma d30 .	
12041507-4	In addition , no suppressive effect of plasma d30 was observed when antigen was added as a class II peptide , thus suggesting that the impaired proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of plasma d30 was due to a dysfunction of antigen uptake/processing by APC .	
12041507-6	Taken together , these results suggest that circulating IgG-bound TGF- is , at least in part , responsible for the impaired responses of CD4+ T cells at the late tumour-bearing stage by suppressing antigen uptake/ processing by APC .	
12041507-1	Plasma from mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days ( plasma d30 ) showed a more profound immunosuppressive effect on the in vitro proliferation of unrelated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the presence of both antigen and antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) than plasma from na�ve mice .	2 22
12041507-0	In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which tumour-specific CD4+ T-cell responses are impaired during tumour development , an attempt was made to identify factors which impair CD4+ T-cell responses at a late tumour-bearing stage .	
12041507-3	Interestingly , immunoglobulin ( IgG)-bound TGF- , but not IgG-unbound TGF- , in plasma d30 was suggested to be responsible for the immunosuppressive activity .	2 22
12041507-2	The level of plasma transforming growth factor ( TGF)- was elevated in mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days compared with na�ve mice , and the suppressive effect of plasma d30 was partially diminished by the neutralization of TGF- .	9 92
23276719-1	It has been said that Necl-5 plays a role in not only cell-cell adhesion , but also cell migration , proliferation , and metastasis .	
20737228-0	n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) have a chemopreventive effect while n-6 PUFA promote carcinogenesis .	
22848179-7	Negative controls , without nanofibers present in the medium , were used for comparison .	
20147338-6	In contrast , significant depletion of glucose and inositol in polyps revealed that glycolysis may be critical in early tumorigenesis .	31 3
22873102-3	Cell proliferation was detected by FCM , ELISA and Western blot were used to observe the gene and protein expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 in Hela cell lines .	
20147338-5	Various amino acids and lipids in the polyps and tumors were elevated , suggesting higher energy needs for increased cellular proliferation .	
23264896-11	In conclusion , our results suggest that the inhibition of TLR4-NFκB signaling by a TLR4-binding peptide may help for the treatment of chronic inflammation and prevention of inflammation-induced cancer in patients with colitis .	a a2
20147338-4	Our data suggest there was a distinct profile change of a wide range of metabolites from mucosa to tumor tissues .	
23276719-8	Necl-5 expression in lung cancer cells is crucial for their invasiveness in the cancer-stromal interaction , suggesting that Necl-5 could be a favorable molecular target for the suppression of invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma .	11 1
22024718-3	DNA flow cytometry analysis and BrdU staining indicated that Tempol induced S phase arrest , which is accompanied by a downregulation of cyclin A. Tempol also induced apoptotic cell death , which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ; \u2206\u03a8m ) , an activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 ( PARP-1 ) .	
20737228-4	All the groups , except the control received a weekly injection of DMH for 4 weeks .	
22024718-1	In this study , we investigated the effects of Tempol on the growth of As4.1 juxtaglomerular cells in relation to cell cycle and cell death .	
22024718-0	A stable nitroxide 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-osyl ( Tempol ) is widely used as an antioxidant invitro and invivo .	
22024718-7	Tempol also activated ERK and JNK signaling , which was responsible for cell growth inhibition .	
22024718-6	In conclusion , Tempol inhibited the growth of As4.1 cells via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .	
22024718-5	MEK and JNK inhibitors significantly attenuated a growth inhibition in Tempol-treated As4.1 cells .	
20737228-5	The animals were sacrificed either 48 h later ( initiation phase ) or kept for 16 weeks ( post initiation phase ) .	
22428047-0	Switching to a glycolytic metabolism is a rapid adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia .	
22428047-1	Although this metabolic conversion may primarily represent a rescue pathway to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating tumor cells , it also creates a gradient of lactate that mirrors the gradient of oxygen in tumors .	
22428047-2	More than a metabolic waste , the lactate anion is known to participate to cancer aggressiveness , in part through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) pathway in tumor cells .	
22428047-3	Whether lactate may also directly favor HIF-1 activation in endothelial cells ( ECs ) thereby offering a new druggable option to block angiogenesis is however an unanswered question .	
22428047-4	In this study , we therefore focused on the role in ECs of monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) that we previously identified to be the main facilitator of lactate uptake in cancer cells .	
20147338-1	In the present study , we studied the metabolomic profiles using high analyte specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) to attain a systems-level view of the shift in metabolism in cells progressing along the path to CRC .	
22428047-6	Our demonstration is based on the unprecedented characterization of lactate-induced HIF-1 activation in normoxic ECs and the consecutive increase in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression .	71 7 711
22428047-7	Furthermore , using a variety of functional assays including endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis together with in vivo imaging of tumor angiogenesis through intravital microscopy and immunohistochemistry , we documented that MCT1 blockers could act as bona fide HIF-1 inhibitors leading to anti-angiogenic effects .	7 71
22428047-8	Together with the previous demonstration of MCT1 being a key regulator of lactate exchange between tumor cells , the current study identifies MCT1 inhibition as a therapeutic modality combining antimetabolic and anti-angiogenic activities .	7 71
20737228-7	The post initiation study showed severe inflammation with hyperplasia , increased ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , a decrease in antioxidants and apoptosis .	a21 a2 a 8 81
21739465-0	BACKGROUND Androgens and the androgen receptor ( AR ) play important roles in the development of male urogenital organs .	
21739465-1	We previously found that mice with total AR knockout ( ARKO ) and epithelial ARKO failed to develop normal prostate with loss of differentiation .	
23304206-6	In conclusion , we report a new mechanism in which RA could cause apoptosis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through p35 cleavage and Cdk5 over-activation .	8 81
22768158-3	Further , our combined results of GC-MS and microarray based gene expression profiling of undifferentiated and OCT4-depleted hESCs are consistent with the Warburg effect which is increased glycolysis in embryonic cells and tumor cells in the presence of O(2) while oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) is impaired or even shut down .	31 3
23137536-6	In contrast , concomitant knockdown of the four miRNAs by antisense inhibitors increased the CKIIα protein level and suppressed CKII inhibition-mediated senescence .	42 4
23137536-5	The four miRNA mimics increased senescent-associated β-galactosidase ( SA-β-gal ) staining , p53 and p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production .	a21 42 a2 4 a
23137536-4	Reporter analysis and RT-PCR have suggested that these four miRNAs may stimulate degradation of CKIIα mRNA by targeting its 3 ' untranslated regions ( UTRs ) .	
23137536-3	Mimics of all four miRNAs jointly downregulated CKIIα expression in HCT116 cells .	
23137536-2	Four miRNAs ( miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 ) were predicted to be miRNAs against CKIIα mRNA .	
23137536-1	To investigate the role of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in CKII downregulation during senescence , we employed computational algorithms .	
23137536-0	We previously demonstrated that downregulation of protein kinase CKII induces cellular senescence in human colon cancer HCT116 cells .	
23137536-8	Therefore , the present results show that miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 cooperatively promote cellular senescence through the p53-p21(Cip1/WAF1) pathway by CKII downregulation-mediated ROS production in HCT116 cells .	a21 42 a2 4 a
23222813-2	In this study , we show that CTHRC1 is highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer tissues and plays a role in the progression and metastasis of the disease .	1 12
23250485-6	These findings demonstrate a role for increased fat metabolism and autophagy in prostatic neoplasias and highlight the potential of targeting underexplored metabolic pathways for the development of novel therapeutics .	82 8
20890633-3	Given orally , compound 2 prolonged the lifespans of leukemia mice intraperitoneally inoculated with the murine P388 leukemic cells .	
23222813-3	CTHRC1 promoted primary tumor growth and metastatic spread of cancer cells to distant organs in orthotopic xenograft tumor mouse models .	1 12
24174263-1	Glycoconjugation could be applied to inhibitors of many enzymes involved in glycolysis or tumor metabolism .	31 3
20890633-0	Designed from a high throughput screened hit compound , novel 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazoles were synthesized and demonstrated cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. 1-(4-Phenylthiazol-2-yl)-4-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-amine ( compound 2 ) , a 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazole , inhibited tubulin polymerization , interacted with the colchicine-binding sites of tubulins , and caused cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase in human gastric cancer cells .	511 5 51
23222813-0	Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 ( CTHRC1 ) is a secreted protein involved in vascular remodeling , bone formation and developmental morphogenesis .	
23264896-10	Rather , its binding to TLR4 inhibits the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 , production of IL-1β and IL-6 , activity of NFκB , migration and invasion of SW480 cells .	11 1
20100566-7	Photoactivated MVP was able to induce single- and double-strand breaks in DNA , with a predominance of single-stand breaks .	612 61 6
1327543-3	Our results suggest that the transformed phenotype is due to the production of a mas receptor ligand distinct from angiotensin .	
1327543-2	To understand why mas-transfected cells exhibit a transformed phenotype and if angiotensin responsiveness plays any role in this process , we studied the growth characteristics of mas-transfected 3T3 cells and demonstrated that they lose contact inhibition , exhibit foci formation , and increased DNA synthesis even in absence of serum .	5 52
1327543-1	Its stable expression in a variety of cell lines conferred some angiotensin responsiveness .	
1327543-0	Mas oncogene has been shown to have focus-inducing ability in NIH 3T3 cells which are tumorigenic in vivo in nude mice .	
22851530-3	RESULTS We have developed pair-read informed split mapping ( PRISM ) , a method that identifies SVs and their precise breakpoints from whole-genome resequencing data .	
22851530-2	However , most of these only report an approximate location for each SV , rather than exact breakpoints .	
22851530-1	Current methods are typically based on depth of coverage or pair-end mapping clusters .	
22851530-0	MOTIVATION The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled novel methods for detecting structural variants ( SVs ) .	
11849319-1	However , it has not been completely elucidated which activity is mainly involved in the tumour suppression in vivo .	
11849319-0	Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) has pleiotropic activities other than its antivirus action , including cell growth inhibition , natural killer ( NK ) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) activation , and angiogenesis inhibitory activity , and these activities are supposed to be involved in its antitumour activity .	
11849319-3	After intravenous injection of tumour cells , tumour deposits in the lungs and liver were increased and life span was shorter in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice , indicating important roles for IFN-gamma in antitumour mechanisms .	
11849319-2	In this study , we analysed inhibitory mechanisms of endogenous IFN-gamma against B16 melanoma experimental metastasis .	
11849319-5	Furthermore , only low levels of cell-mediated immunity against the tumour and activation of NK cells were observed , indicating that antimetastatic effects of IFN-gamma is not mediated by host cells .	1 12
11849319-4	Interestingly , tumour deposits were not increased in IFN-gamma receptor ( R)(-/- ) mice .	
11849319-7	These observations suggest that IFN-gamma prevents B16 melanoma experimental metastasis by directly inhibiting the cell growth , although antitumour host functions may also be involved in a later phase .	1 12
11849319-6	The survival period of B16 melanoma-bearing IFN-gamma R(-/-) mice was , however , shorter than wild-type mice .	
23111389-0	Here we report that miR-93 , a miRNA in the miR-106B cluster , a paralog of the miR-17-92 cluster , was significantly upregulated in human breast carcinoma tissues .	
23111389-7	Silencing LATS2 expression promoted cell survival , tube formation and invasion , while ectopic expression of LATS2 decreased cell survival and invasion .	
23222813-6	Treatment with chemical inhibitors of Src , MEK or Rac1 and expression of dominant-negative Rac1 attenuated CTHRC1-induced cell migration and adhesion .	
23111389-6	Higher levels of LATS2 were associated with cell death in the tumor mass .	
22948179-7	Further investigations showed that activation of AKT and FAK were required for rSHH-N-mediated upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 , cell migration and invasion .	11 1
23111389-5	We examined the potential target that mediated miR-93's effects and found that the large tumor suppressor , homology 2 ( LATS2 ) was a target of miR-93 .	
21541970-4	Apoptosis was measured by immunoblotting of apoptotic proteins and by Hoechst staining of condensed DNA .	
23111389-4	In cell culture , expression of miR-93 enhanced cell survival and invasion .	
22842620-6	Our data suggest that aberrant TSHR function may contribute to lung cancer development or a subgroup of lung cancer with specific clinical phenotypes .	
22674789-4	This assay provides an important new tool for the fission yeast community and , because many aspects of mammalian chromatin organization have been well-conserved in Sz. pombe but not in S. cerevisiae , also offers an attractive system to decipher the role of chromatin structure in modulating the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks .	
22674789-2	Variations of the HO site-specific DSB assay have been adapted to many organisms , but the methodology has seen only limited use in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because of the lack of a promoter capable of inducing endonuclease expression on a relatively short time scale ( We have overcome this limitation by developing a new assay in which expression of the homing endonuclease I-PpoI is tightly regulated with a tetracycline-inducible promoter .	
22674789-3	We show that induction of the I-PpoI endonuclease produces rapid cutting of a defined cleavage site ( > 80% after 1 h ) , efficient cell cycle arrest and significant accumulation of the checkpoint protein Crb2 at break-adjacent regions in a manner that is analogous to published findings with DSBs produced by an acute exposure to ionizing irradiation .	
22674789-0	Double-strand DNA breaks are a serious threat to cellular viability and yeast systems have proved invaluable in helping to understand how these potentially toxic lesions are sensed and repaired .	
22674789-1	An important method to study the processing of DNA breaks in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is to introduce a unique double-strand break into the genome by regulating the expression of the site-specific HO endonuclease with a galactose inducible promoter .	
23167425-3	In this study , we assessed the influence of EGCG on the proliferative potential of HeLa cells by cell viability assay and authenticated the results by nuclear morphological examination , DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis .	
23167425-2	( -)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) , a promising chemopreventive agent , has attracted extensive interest for cancer therapy utilizing its antioxidant , anti- proliferative and inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion .	
23167425-1	Pharmacological or therapeutic interventions such as chemoprevention of the progression stages of neoplastic development could result in substantial reduction in the incidence of cancer mortality .	
22842620-4	In order to characterize the genetic features of TSHR in lung cancer , we checked for TSHR expression and copy number in the 96 lung cancer tissues .	
23167425-7	Interestingly , EGCG effectively inhibited invasion and migration of HeLa cells and modulated the expression of related genes ( MMP-9 and TIMP-1 ) .	11 1
22495714-11	However , further studies based on real-time quantitative RT-PCR are needed to identify the exact gene expression levels .	
23167425-5	Our results indicated that EGCG induced growth inhibition of HeLa cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner .	
23167425-4	Further we analyzed the anti-invasive properties of EGCG by wound migration assay and gene expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in HeLa cells .	
22842620-3	This patient had lung adenocarcinoma with BAC ( bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ) features in the setting of a prior medical history significant for carotid stenosis and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .	
23167425-8	These results indicate that EGCG may effectively suppress promotion and progression stages of cervical cancer development .	
23166510-1	In mammals , male germ cells express two genetically and developmentally distinct populations of piRNAs at the pre-pachytene and pachytene stages of meiosis , respectively .	
22842620-2	We found one patient with a somatic mutation at codon 458 ( exon 10 ) , which is located at the transmembrane domain where most TSHR mutations have been found in thyroid-related diseases .	63 6
22888341-3	Human gastric cancer SGC-7901 tissues were orthotopically implanted into the stomach of NOD SCID mice .	
22888341-2	Methods .	
22888341-1	The present study was performed to investigate the effect of N-desulfated heparin on basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression , tumor angiogenesis and metastasis of gastric carcinoma .	
22888341-0	Objective .	
22888341-7	In vivo , the tumor metastasis rates were 9/10 in normal saline group and 2/10 in N-desulfated heparin group ( P < 0.05 ) .	1 12
22842620-1	We screened for mutations in all coding regions of the TSHR gene in 96 lung adenocarcinoma samples and their matched adjacent normal lung samples .	
22888341-5	In vitro , human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells were treated with N-desulfated heparin in different concentration ( 0.1 mg/mL , 1 mg/mL , N-desulfated heparin group ) , and treated with medium ( control group ) .	
22888341-4	Twenty mice were randomly divided into two groups which received either intravenous injection of 0.9% NaCl solution ( normal saline group ) or 10 mg/kg N-desulfated heparin ( N-desulfated heparin group ) twice weekly for three weeks .	
22888341-9	There was no bleeding in N-desulfated heparin group .	
22842620-0	In a screen for thoracic malignancy-associated markers , thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR ) was identified as a candidate as it binds to the previously-characterized lung cancer marker NKX2-1 .	
22990536-10	Our results showed that EG-VEGF expression is an indicator not only of the advanced stage , but also of ovarian cancer progression .	71 7 711
23166510-0	Piwi-interacting RNAs are a diverse class of small non-coding RNAs implicated in the silencing of transposable elements and the safeguarding of genome integrity .	
24260485-5	These data underscore a previously unidentified role for CD43 in non-hematopoietic tumor progression .	
23222813-5	CTHRC1 activated several key signaling molecules , including Src , focal adhesion kinase , paxillin , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Rac1 .	
22970388-6	Samples that were positive for cancer cells were obtained from six patients .	
12674762-8	Curcumin can induce apoptosis of primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells and disturb cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells .	91 81 9 8
12674762-9	The mechanism appeared to be mediated by perturbing G0/G1 phases checkpoints which associated with up-regulation of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- expression , and down-regulation of cyclin D3 .	9 51 511 5 91
23255896-10	In conclusion , we found that sorafenib exhibits antiproliferative effects in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines and when combined with gemcitabine demonstrates synergistic activity in A549 and H1666 cells but antagonistic activity in H1975 cells .	
22970388-7	Three of these patients had detectable PIK3CA mutations in bone marrow cancer cells .	63 6
12674762-2	The TUNEL positive cell percentage was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT)-mediated Biotin dUNP end labeling technique .	
12674762-3	It was found that when HL-60 cells were treated with 25 mumol/L curcumin for 24 h , the expression level of Mcl-1 was down-regulated , but that of Bax and Bak up-regulated time-dependently .	
12674762-0	To investigate whether the Bcl-2 gene family is involved in modulating mechanism of apoptosis and change of cell cycle protein induced by curcumin in acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line and primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells , the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak and cell cycle proteins including P27kipl , P21wafl , cyclin D3 and pRbp- were selected and their expression detected by SABC immuno-histochemical stain method .	
12674762-1	The attitude of sub-G1 peak in DNA histogram was determined by FCM .	
12674762-6	The expression of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- were elevated and that of cyclin D3 decreased in the presence of curcumin .	9 51 511 5 91
12674762-7	These findings suggested that the Bcl-2 gene family indeed participated in the regulatory process of apoptosis induced by curcumin in HL-60 cells and AML cells .	8 81
12674762-4	There was significant difference in the expression level of Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak between the curcumin-treated groups and control group ( P < 0.05-0.01 ) .	
12674762-5	At the same time , curcumin had no effect on progress of cell cycle in primaty acute myelogenous leukemia at newly diagnosis , but could increase the peak of Sub-G1 ( P < 0.05 ) , and down-regulate the expression of Mcl-1 and up-regulate the expression of Bax and Bak with the difference being statistically significant .	91 9
22970388-5	Fourteen patients with breast cancer bone metastases were biopsied by three methods : CT-guided bone biopsies ; bone marrow trephine biopsies ; and bone marrow aspiration .	
22970388-2	However , whole genome sequencing studies have shown that the mutational profiles of cancers evolve over time and often differ between primary and metastatic sites .	
20406967-0	We studied the effect of the immune system on two differentially aggressive melanomas developing in mice on conditional deletion of the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor gene , with concomitant expression of oncogene H-Ras(G12V) and a natural cancer-germline tumor antigen ( TA ) .	
22970388-3	Activating point mutations in the PIK3CA gene are common in primary breast cancer tumors , but their presence in breast cancer bone metastases has not been assessed previously .	
22867999-9	Ingenuity pathways analysis of human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray ( hMitChip3 ) gene chip data confirmed the altered mRNA expression patterns of genes involved in several important pathways , such as lipid metabolism , apoptosis , and energy production/glycolysis .	8 31 81 3
22970388-0	Background .	
23251664-10	Six amino acids in the EGF-like domain were identified as the Y-142 binding epitope .	
22867999-8	The UOK268 cells had severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolytic flux .	31 3
12486230-5	AlkB , ABH2 , and ABH3 can also repair 1-ethyladenine residues in DNA with the release of acetaldehyde .	62 6
12486230-4	Both enzymes remove 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from methylated polynucleotides in an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent reaction , and act by direct damage reversal with the regeneration of the unsubstituted bases .	
22970388-1	An important goal of personalized cancer therapy is to tailor specific therapies to the mutational profile of individual patients .	
12486230-1	AlkB is an alpha-ketoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase that oxidizes the relevant methyl groups and releases them as formaldehyde .	
12486230-0	The Escherichia coli AlkB protein protects against the cytotoxicity of methylating agents by repair of the DNA lesions 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine , which are generated in single-stranded stretches of DNA .	
12486230-3	The levels of their mRNAs do not appear to correlate with cell proliferation but tissue distributions are different .	
12486230-2	Here , we identify two human AlkB homologs , ABH2 and ABH3 , by sequence and fold similarity , functional assays , and complementation of the E. coli alkB mutant phenotype .	
24260485-3	Here we provide evidence that the CD43 sialomucin cooperates with oncogenic signals to promote cell transformation by abrogating the contact inhibition of growth through a molecular mechanism that involves AKT-dependent Merlin phosphorylation and degradation .	5 52
12814188-8	Taken together our data suggest that a heterogeneous fibroblast population with different life span is activated/recruited in the breast interstitium and poses the problem of a unique activation/recruitment of fibroblasts in neoplastic conditions .	
12814188-4	The fibroblasts from normal tissue completed 12 passages in a CM-independent way prior to senescence whereas fibroblasts from tumour stroma senescence were attained after 48 passages .	42 4
12814188-5	These cells showed a marked decrease of telomerase activity , growth rate and smooth muscle alpha-actin expressing myofibroblasts after the 32nd passage .	
12814188-6	CM treatment of this fibroblast population induces a decline in the myofibroblast content , which precedes the changes in telomerase activity .	
12814188-7	Passaged fibroblasts from normal breast tissue can be converted to myofibroblasts upon CM treatment whereas those from tumour stroma were CM-insensitive .	
12814188-0	The telomerase activity and the senescence profile of cultured breast fibroblasts from normal human interstitial and malignant stromal tissue were studied in comparison with their proliferation and differentiation pattern .	
12814188-1	Fibroblasts were grown either in the presence or absence of a conditioned medium ( CM ) obtained from cultures of the oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cell line .	
12814188-2	At different passages ( from the 2nd up to the 48th ) , fibroblasts were examined for the telomerase activity by the Telomerase Repeats Amplification Protocol ( TRAP ) assay , for proliferation profile by Ki-67 antigen expression , and the myofibroblast or smooth muscle cell-like differentiation pattern by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle markers .	
12814188-3	Serial passages of fibroblasts from normal or tumour breast reveal that the relationship between the levels of telomerase activity and phenotypic/proliferation profile changes with cell subcultivation in a different manner in the two cell populations .	
22840462-1	We here present a novel angiogenesis marker , microvessel proliferation ( MVP ) , based on dual immunohistochemical staining of nestin and Ki-67 .	
22840462-0	BACKGROUND : To quantify tumour angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) has been widely used .	
22840462-3	MATERIALS AND METHODS : Microvessel proliferation was evaluated in 178 breast cancer samples and estimated by vascular proliferation index ( VPI ) , the ratio between the number of vessels containing proliferating endothelial cells and the total number of immature vessels .	
22840462-2	Immature endothelial cells express nestin , and when co-expressed with the proliferation marker Ki-67 , the number of proliferating immature blood vessels can be measured .	
22840462-5	Also , high VPI was significantly associated with interval detected breast cancer compared with screening detected lesions ( p<0.0005 ) , and adverse outcome in univariate and multivariate survival analysis ( p=0.034 and p=0.022 , respectively ) .	
22840462-4	RESULTS : High VPI was strongly associated with several markers of aggressive breast cancer , such as negative oestrogen receptor ( ER ) status ( p=0.003 ) , high tumour cell proliferation by Ki-67 ( p=0.004 ) , high p53 expression ( p=0.001 ) , and five profiles for the basal-like phenotype ( odds ratios ( OR ) ; range 3.4-6.3 ) .	9 93
12065244-3	Medium conditioned by IGFBP-rP1-producing cultures reduced cumulative cell numbers in parental MCF-7 cultures by 20% compared with medium from cultures of a control vector-transduced cell line .	
12065244-2	Compared with control vector-transduced cells , cumulative cell numbers for IGFBP-rP1-transduced polyclonal or clonal cell cultures were reduced by 39 and 74% , respectively , after 1 week .	
12065244-1	To test this hypothesis , we used a retroviral vector to express IGFBP-rP1 cDNA in the IGFBP-rP1-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cell line .	
12065244-0	Elevated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 ( IGFBP-rP1 ) mRNA in senescent human mammary epithelial cells suggested that the IGFBP-3 gene product may inhibit cell proliferation .	
12065244-7	These findings indicate that IGFBP-rP1 is an inhibitor of MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation and may act via a cellular senescence-like mechanism .	9 42 4
12065244-6	Flow cytometry analysis indicated that twice as many noncycling cells were present in the IGFBP-rP1-transduced MCF-7 cell cultures compared with controls .	
12065244-5	The percentage of cells containing senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity was doubled compared with control cell cultures .	42 4
12065244-4	Nuclear fragmentation analysis and cell proliferation assays completed in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone excluded apoptosis as the responsible mechanism .	8 81
22840462-6	CONCLUSION : Microvessel proliferation is a novel marker of ongoing angiogenesis and was associated with aggressive tumour features , basal-like phenotypes , interval presentation , and prognosis in this series of breast cancer .	7 71
20679748-6	There were a few complicated hemangiomas in the study sample : 2 with calcification and 1 with necrosis .	83 8
20679748-7	The sensitivity of CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was 76.92% ; specificity , 33.3% ; positive prognostic value , 83.3% ; and negative prognostic value , 25.0% .	
20679748-4	No association between hepatic hemangioma and patient's age was found ( chi(2)=0.547 , df=2 , P=0.761 ) .	
20679748-5	Nearly one-third of hemangiomas were located in the segment IV of the left hepatic lobe .	
20679748-2	All patients underwent intravenous contrast-enhanced US , intravenous contrast-enhanced CT , and MRI and were diagnosed with hepatic hemangioma according to the findings of these examinations .	
20679748-3	RESULTS The size of hemangiomas was < or =2.0 cm in 20 cases ( 41.7% ) and >2.0 cm in 28 ( 58.3% ) .	
20679748-0	AIM To compare the value of intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( US ) , intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas .	
20679748-1	MATERIAL AND METHODS The study enrolled 48 patients , aged between 20 and 79 years ( 35 [ 72.9% ] women , 13 [ 27.1% ] men ; mean age , 53.5+/-12.855 years ) , who were examined and treated in the Departments of Gastroenterology , Surgery , and Oncology , Hospital of Kaunas University of Medicine , in the year 2007 .	
22778940-4	This study aims to find the correct indications for LET in ESRC taking into consideration clinical-pathological features of tumours that may reduce the risk of lymph node metastasis to zero .	
20679748-8	The sensitivity of intravenous contrast-enhanced US in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was 77.8% ; specificity , 100% ; positive prognostic value , 100% ; and negative prognostic value , 23.1% .	
20679748-9	CONCLUSIONS Intravenous contrast-enhanced US is more specific than intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma ( P=0.0005 ) and has a higher positive prognostic value ( P=0.001 ) .	
22790975-8	Since expression levels of the mutant and wild-type subunits in artificial model cell systems were unable to explain the disease symptoms , the mechanism leading to dominant inheritance in this family remains to be determined .	
22778940-5	Methods .	
23251664-1	Modulation of HB-EGF activity might have a therapeutic potential in the oncology area .	
22790975-0	Myotonia congenita-inducing mutations in the muscle chloride channel CLC-1 normally result in reduced open probability ( P ( o) ) of this channel .	
22778940-2	The reasons for these poor results lie mostly in the high risk of the disease's diffusion to local-regional lymph nodes even in ESRC .	
22790975-2	We report here a family with myotonia congenita characterized by muscle stiffness and clinical and electrophysiologic myotonic phenomena transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern .	
22790975-3	DNA sequencing of DMPK and ZNF9 genes for myotonic muscular dystrophy types I and II was normal , whereas sequencing of CLC-1 encoding gene , CLCN1 , identified a single heterozygous missense mutation , G233S .	
22790975-4	Patch-clamp analyses of this mutant CLC-1 channel in Xenopus oocytes revealed an increased P ( o ) of the channel's fast-gate , from in the wild type to >0.9 in the mutant at -90 mV .	
22790975-5	In contrast , the mutant exhibits a minimal effect on the P ( o ) of the common-gate .	
22790975-6	These results are consistent with the structural prediction that the mutation site is adjacent to the fast-gate of the channel .	
22778940-3	Aims .	
22778940-0	Background .	
22778940-1	Over the past ten years oncological outcomes achieved by local excision techniques ( LETs ) as the sole treatment for early stages of rectal cancer ( ESRC ) have been often disappointing .	
12391022-3	The results indicate that Fas ligand is involved not only in direct hepatocyte killing but also in the process of inflammation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis .	a a2 81 8
12391022-2	Here , using a unique animal model of chronic hepatitis that induces hepatocellular carcinogenesis , we demonstrate that neutralization of the activity of Fas ligand prevented hepatocyte apoptosis , proliferation , liver inflammation , and the eventual development of hepatocellular carcinoma .	8 81 a a2
12391022-1	However , the molecular and cellular basis for the procarcinogenic potential of the immune response is not well defined .	
12391022-0	A persistent immune response to hepatitis viruses is a well-recognized risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma .	
12391022-4	This is the first demonstration that amelioration of chronic inflammation by some treatment actually caused reduction of cancer development .	a a2
23251664-11	Among the six amino acids , the combination of F115 and Y123 determined the amphiregulin cross-reactivity and that F115 accounted for the species selectivity .	
22426302-0	Changes at the invariable donor splice site +1 guanine , relatively frequent in human genetic disease , are predicted to abrogate correct splicing , and thus are classified as null mutations .	
22426302-1	However , their ability to direct residual expression , which might have pathophysiological implications in several diseases , has been poorly investigated .	
22623531-9	In summary , through a functional genomics approach , pathways essential in the context of oncogenic MYC but not to normal cells were identified , thus revealing a rich therapeutic space linked to a previously " undruggable " oncogene .	
23180966-10	CONCLUSION Our study is the first to demonstrate that expression of \u03b3-H2AX detected by immunohistochemistry may represent an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer .	612 61 6
22426302-2	As a model to address this issue , we studied the IVS6+1G>T mutation found in patients with severe deficiency of the protease triggering coagulation , factor VII ( FVII ) , whose absence is considered lethal .	
21982881-7	BARD1 is one of the most highly mobile proteins yet detected at the centrosome , and in contrast to its localization at DNA repair foci , which requires dimerization with BRCA1 , targeting of BARD1 to the centrosome occurs prior to heterodimerization and its rapid turnover may provide a mechanism to regulate dimer formation .	
20573279-8	Moreover , HB-19 treatment caused selective down regulation of transcripts coding matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the TIII cells and in melanoma tumors of RET mice .	
20573279-9	CONCLUSIONS Although HB-19 treatment failed to prevent the development of spontaneous melanoma in the RET mice , it delayed for several months the onset and frequency of cutaneous tumors , and exerted a significant inhibitory effect on visceral metastasis .	1 12
23383661-3	All of HCC cases were diagnosed histologically and treated with surgical resection .	
22426302-3	In expression studies , the IVS6+1G>T induced exon 6 skipping and frame-shift , and prevented synthesis of correct FVII transcripts detectable by radioactive/fluorescent labelling or real-time RT-PCR .	
23383661-5	All subjects had HBV of genotype C2 .	
23383661-4	The whole of the X , S , basal core promoter ( BCP ) and precore regions of the viral genome from sera or liver tissues were sequenced .	
23383661-7	Moreover , the T1762/A1764 mutations in the BCP region in combination with either T1653 or A1896 were more common in the HCC compared with the CHB group ( BCP+X1653 : 18% vs 11% , P = 0.05 ; BCP+PC , 40% vs 15% , P < 0.001 , respectively ) .	63 6
23383661-6	The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the X region and the A1896 mutation in the precore region of HBV was significantly higher in the HCC group than in the control CHB group ( 22% vs 11% , P = 0.003 ; 50% vs 23% , P < 0.001 , respectively ) .	63 6
20573279-0	BACKGROUND The importance of cell-surface nucleolin in cancer biology was recently highlighted by studies showing that ligands of nucleolin play critical role in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis .	
20573279-1	By using a specific antagonist that binds the C-terminal tail of nucleolin , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , we recently reported that HB-19 treatment markedly suppressed the progression of established human breast tumor cell xenografts in the athymic nude mice without apparent toxicity .	
20573279-2	METHODS The in vivo antitumoral action of HB-19 treatment was assessed on the spontaneous development of melanoma in the RET transgenic mouse model .	
20573279-3	Ten days old RET mice were treated with HB-19 in a prophylactic setting that extended 300 days .	
20573279-4	In parallel , the molecular basis for the action of HB-19 was investigated on a melanoma cell line ( called TIII ) derived from a cutaneous nodule of a RET mouse .	
20573279-5	RESULTS HB-19 treatment of RET mice caused a significant delay in the onset of cutaneous tumors , several-months delay in the incidence of large tumors , a lower frequency of cutaneous nodules , and a reduction of visceral metastatic nodules while displaying no toxicity to normal tissue .	
20573279-6	Moreover , microvessel density was significantly reduced in tumors recovered from HB-19 treated mice compared to corresponding controls .	7 71

1419600-7	The effects of oestradiol on the sensitivity of cells to the proliferative effects of bFGF did not appear to result from regulation of bFGF receptor expression .	9 93 92
1419600-6	Overall , bFGF had the greatest effect on cell proliferation although this was less marked than the previously described effect of the IGFs and insulin .	9 92

22275235-4	The pHA/SF exhibited a furry texture around the pHA crystals , most likely due to the stored charged and zeta potentials .	
22275235-7	The quantitative analysis of the endothelial morphogenesis indicated that the pHA/SF film enhanced the formation of capillary-like structures compared with SF and HA/SF .	
22275235-6	The number of migrated cells on the HA/SF and pHA/SF was times larger than that on the SF .

15515527-8	There were statistically significant correlations between the score of PDGF/ dThdPase , or VEGF and the score of MVD respectively .	
15515527-9	CONCLUSION The present study suggests that there was a correlation between VEGF or PDGF and MVD .	71 7 711
15515527-2	RESULT The percentage of VEGF was 25.38% in primary tumor and 21.52% in lymph nodes .	71 7 711
15515527-3	No significant difference was found .	
15515527-0	OBJECTIVE To evaluate the difference of angiogenic factors PDGF/dThdPase,VEGF expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) in primary hypopharyngeal tumor and metastasis lymph nodes .

21982881-0	BARD1 heterodimerizes with BRCA1 , forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions at nuclear foci to repair DNA damage and the centrosome to regulate mitosis .	
20948210-1	To further assess the antitumor potential and turn it into a candidate new antitumor drug , the antitumor mechanism of GA was investigated .	
20948210-0	BACKGROUND Ginkgolic acids ( GAs ) , extracted from the seed coat of Ginkgo biloba L. Our previous study has shown that GA monomer could inhibit the growth of Hep-2 significantly and induce the fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA .	
20948210-3	The effect of GA monomer on the proliferation of tumor cell lines was analyzed with MTT colorimetric and CFSE labeled assay .	
20948210-2	METHOD The cytotoxicity and antitumor effect of GA monomer were assayed by MTT colorimetric assay with nontumorogenic MC-3T3-E1 as well as tumorogenic Hep-2 and Tac8113 cell lines .	
20948210-5	The expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , Bax and caspase-3 was analyzed with Western blot .	
20948210-4	Cell cycle distribution and measurement of the percentage of apoptotic cells were performed by flow cytometry following stained with propidium iodide , annexin V-FITC .	
20948210-7	Tumor cells were treated with GA for 72 h , 70.53 ± 4.54% Hep-2 and 63.5 ± 7.2% Tca8113 cells were retarded at GO/G1 phase , and the percentage of apoptosis was 40.4 ± 1.58 and 38.4 ± 1.7% , respectively .	51 5 511 8 81
20948210-6	RESULT GA only inhibited the growth of tumorogenic cell lines in a both dose- and time-dependent manner .	
20948210-9	CONCLUSIONS The antitumor action of GA was due to inhibiting the proliferation in a manner of inhibiting division , retarding the progress of cell cycle and inducing apoptosis , making GA a candidate as new antitumor drug .	
20948210-8	GA-treated activated caspase-3 downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein , eventually leading to a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in tumor cells .	8 81
1408144-2	The study of two established clonal lines showed that they acquired only after some weeks , and stepwise , the main characteristics of full neoplastic transformation , i.e. anchorage independence , reduced requirement for serum growth factors and tumorigenicity .	
1408144-3	Later both clonal lines became increasingly tumorigenic and completely independent of exogenous growth and attachment factors , without increase in the expression of the H-ras oncogene .	
1408144-0	The ras oncogenes alone fully transform established ( immortalized ) rodent fibroblasts in a few days , but generally transform early-passage fibroblasts only partially , unless their action is complemented by that of a nuclear , immortalizing , oncogene .	
1408144-1	Here we show that transfection of second-passage Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts ( HEFs ) by the EJ-H-ras oncogene coupled to the neo gene , followed by selection with G418 , gives rise to apparently normal , or only slightly transformed , clonal colonies , only a few of which become established .	
1408144-6	Highly tumorigenic , serum-independent and immortalized clones expressing both oncogenes were obtained from these cultures .	4 41
1408144-7	Hence , the truncated myb(KXANM) oncogene accelerate the stepwise transformation of unestablished HEFs by the EJ-HH-ras oncogene and , together with this oncogene , fully transforms these same cells in a single step .	
1408144-4	Transfection of one of the clones , early after its isolation , with a truncated derivative of the nuclear v-myb oncogene devoid of its transcriptional negative regulatory domain and able to partially transform chicken embryo fibroblasts [ (myb(KXANM) ] gave rise to more transformed cells , expressing both EJ-H-ras and myb(KXANM) , which became tumorigenic earlier than the controls and remained more tumorigenic later on .	
1408144-5	With more efficient transfection techniques , numerous foci of fully transformed cells were subsequently obtained , in a few days , in cultures transfected sequentially with EJ-H-ras(neo) and myb(KXANM) and in cultures co-transfected with the two oncogenes .	
1408144-8	The two oncogenes acting in cooperation also induce cell immortalization , but myb(KXANM) , by itself , is not an immortalizing oncogene .	4 41
1408144-9	No cooperation was observed between EJ-H-ras(neo) and the unaltered v-myb oncogene .	
23255243-1	Regulatory T cell ( Tregs)-induced tumor tolerance and Akt expression play important roles in the tumor survival .	
23255243-0	BACKGROUND: : Radiotherapy is an efficient remedy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( Hca ) ; however , some cancer cells can still survive from the radiation and the therapeutic effect is to be improved .	
23255243-3	METHODS: : A rat Hca model was developed .	
23255243-2	This study aims to elucidate the role of radiation induces Akt expression in Tregs .	
23255243-5	The frequency of Treg and apoptotic Treg in Hca tissue was assessed by flow cytometry .	
23255243-4	Hca tissue was collected from the rats with or without radiotherapy .	
23255243-7	RESULTS: : After radiotherapy , the frequency of Treg was increased in Hca , the frequency of apoptotic Tregs was decreased and the expression of Akt was increased in the remaining Tregs .	8 81
23255243-6	A cell culture model was used to investigate the mechanism by which the tumor-infiltrating Tregs survive from irradiation .	
23255243-9	The addition of Akt inhibitor blocked the irradiation-induced Treg survival .	
23255243-8	The results were reproduced in vitro with a cell culture model .	
20184723-8	Several genes that were specifically regulated by the presence of activated neutrophils could be identified and these were mostly involved in interferon signalling , oxidative stress response and cell cycle progression .	a21 a2 a
21123967-2	Cell proliferation assays were performed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method .	
23513490-9	Although surgical series have not shown any significant survival benefits given by tumor resection , the patient's quality of life may be improved .	
21123967-3	For detection of apoptosis , the Annexin V-binding capacity of treated cells was examined by flow cytometry .	
20184723-2	METHODS In the present study , we used microarrays in order to obtain a global view of the transcriptional responses of the lung to LPS in mice , which mimics an acute lung inflammation .	
20184723-3	To investigate the influence of neutrophils in this process , we depleted mice from circulating neutrophils by treatment with anti-PMN antibodies prior to LPS exposure .	
20661828-0	The biological activities of tocotrienols are receiving increasing attention .	
20184723-1	More detailed information on inflammatory pathways and the role of neutrophils herein is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of inflammation associated cancer .	
20184723-6	Notably , the number of genes and pathways that were differentially expressed , was reduced when animals were depleted from circulating neutrophils , confirming the central role of neutrophils in the inflammatory response .	a a2
20184723-7	Furthermore , there was a significant correlation between the differentially expressed gene list and the promutagenic DNA lesion M1dG , suggesting that it is the extent of the immune response which drives genetic instability in the inflamed lung .	a1 a
22201186-3	Herein , we demonstrate that prolonged inhibition of GSK3 triggers an apoptotic response only in human pancreatic cancer cells but not in human non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cells .	8 81
20184723-4	RESULTS A total of 514 genes was greater than 1.5-fold differentially expressed in the LPS induced lung inflammation model. 394 of the 514 were up regulated genes mostly involved in cell cycle and immune/inflammation related processes , such as cytokine/chemokine activity and signalling .	a1 a
22201186-2	This study was undertaken to provide further support for a role of GSK3 in pancreatic cancer cell growth as well as to identify new cellular and molecular mechanisms involved .	
22389673-13	Overall , results of these investigations suggest that non-lethal doses of radiation can be used to make human tumors more amenable to attack by anti-tumor effector molecules and cells .	
22389673-12	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Irradiation of tumor cells can overcome Fas and TRAIL resistance that is long lasting .	8 81
22389673-11	Specific analysis of intracellular sensitizers to apoptosis indicated that while radiation did reduce Bcl-X(L) and c-FLIP protein expression , this reduction did not correlate with the radiation-enhanced sensitivity to Fas and/or TRAIL mediated apoptosis among the three cell types .	8 81
20661828-5	Furthermore , mixed tocotrienols significantly reduced the levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions as compared to the positive controls .	
22596188-8	These findings show that FOXA1 , but not ERα , is essential for AHR-dependent regulation of CCNG2 , assigning a role for FOXA1 in AHR action .	9 93
22596188-0	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) .	
22201186-7	Considering that different approaches leading to stimulation of death receptor signaling are under clinical trials for treatment of unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer , inhibition of GSK3 could represent an attractive new avenue to improve their effectiveness .	8 81
22596188-2	Our previous studies identified cyclin G2 ( CCNG2 ) , an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression , as an AHR target gene ; however , the mechanism of this regulation is unknown .	
22596188-3	Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in T-47D human breast cancer cells revealed a TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR , nuclear co-activator 3 ( NCoA3 ) and the transcription factor forkhead box A1 ( FOXA1 ) , a key regulator of breast cancer cell signaling , to CCNG2 resulting in increases in CCNG2 mRNA and protein levels .	
22596188-4	Mutation of the AHR response element ( AHRE ) and forkhead-binding sites abolished TCDD-induced CCNG2-regulated reporter gene activity .	
22596188-5	RNA interference-mediated knockdown of FOXA1 prevented the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and NCoA3 to CCNG2 and reduced CCNG2 mRNA levels .	
22596188-6	Interestingly , knockdown of FOXA1 also caused a marked decrease in ERα , but not AHR protein levels .	9 93
22201186-6	Finally , we demonstrate that concomitant inhibition of GSK3 potentiates the death ligand-induced apoptotic response in pancreatic cancer cells but not in non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cells and that this effect also requires JNK activity .	8 81
20307623-0	Exposure to benzo[a]pyrene ( BaP ) can induce inflammatory skin diseases and skin cancer , which are both associated to oxidative stress .	
20307623-1	BaP is known to bind with high specificity to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , modifying the expression of CYP1A1 , involved both in cancer and inflammation .	
20307623-2	While the current knowledge is based on murine skin and cell culture data , in this study human healthy skin has been treated with 5muM BaP in conditions simulating occupational and environmental exposure .	
20307623-3	AhR and CYP1A1 expression was evaluated by Western blotting , which revealed their presence even in control untreated skin ; both enzyme and receptor increased more than twofold after exposure to BaP .	
20307623-4	AhR expression level was lower than CYP1A1 in basal conditions and following induction .	
12579213-8	It was found that the NK cell number was low in the tumor but higher around the tumor in early gastric carcinomas , compared with advanced carcinomas ( p>0.05 ) .	
20307623-6	A significant increase in ROS and carbonyl compound production , as well as reduced tissue viability have been determined by BaP .	
20307623-7	The results of this experiment indicate that BaP , an AhR agonist , can significantly increase receptor and CYP1A1 expression and induce oxidative stress in human skin , confirming the involvement of this pathway in the pathogenesis of tissue damage due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .	a21 a2 a
12579213-5	This ratios were lower in diffuse and mixed type carcinomas ( p<0.05 ) .	
12579213-4	There was strong immunorectivity with HSP70 in 62,5% of the intestinal type carcinomas .	
12579213-7	HSP70 immunorectivity was considerably higher in the patients having lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion ( p<0.05 ) .	1
12579213-6	The more tumor size and invasion depth increased , the more HSP70 immunoreactivity was obtained ( p<0.05 ) .	
12579213-1	General characteristics of gastric carcinomas and prognostic factors were studied .	
12579213-0	During the period of 1996-1998 ninety-four gastrectomy specimens with gastric carcinoma referred to Erciyes University , Medical Faculty , Department of Pathology , were examined histopathologically , histochemically and immunohistochemically .	
12579213-3	The association rates of Helicobacter pylori , chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia with gastric carcinomas were high .	
12579213-2	According the Lauren classification , of the 94 cases of gastric carcinomas , 56 were intestinal type , 21 were diffuse type and 17 were mixed type carcinoma .	
21465446-5	Comparison of the functional integrity of the cells was made using their growth profiles obtained by radiolabeled thymidine incorporation and liquid scintillation counting .	
21465446-4	Fluorescence tagged antibodies against alpha smooth muscle actin ( alpha SMA ) and calponin respectively were used as markers to identify cellular structural differences by routine immunohistochemistry .	
21465446-7	Hypoxic adult sheep cells showed increased filamentation .	
21465446-6	RESULTS Marked differences were seen in juxta-alveolar SMCs obtained by digestion of extreme lung parenchyma of hypoxic sheep .	
21465446-1	OBJECTIVE To examine primary cultures of digested juxta-alveolar smooth muscle cells for hypoxia-induced changes .	
21465446-0	BACKGROUND The effect of chronic high altitude hypoxia ( CHAH ) in the juxta-alveolar region near the air-blood interface is unknown because of the experimental inaccessibility of this region .	
21465446-3	Pulmonary venous SMCs were also obtained from dissected 5th to 7th generation levels pulmonary veins ( <0.5 mm ) .	
21465446-2	METHODS Smooth Muscle Cells ( SMCs ) obtained by dispase digestion of the extreme lung parenchyma were used to study the effect of CHAH in the juxta-alveolar region and foetal and maternal cells were compared .	
21465446-9	The growth profiles of juxta-alveolar SMCs showed that the hypoxia-affected cells of both the foetus and adult sheep had a fast initial growth rate peaking at 48h while their normoxic equivalents had a steadier growth rate peaking at 72h .	
21465446-8	Hypoxic foetal sheep cells showed internal restructuring and disorganization of both alpha-SMA and calponin filaments .	
22909774-4	Array comparative genomic hybridization analyses identified deletions at chromosome 16p11.2 in each patient .	
20878069-11	The present study shed light on a set of genes , which could have a predictive role in survival of patients with metastatic gastric tumors .	
20878069-10	ERCC1 C8092A polymorphism seems to be associated with survival in our set of patients .	
22909774-3	Their histories and standard scores on perceptual and acoustic speech tasks met clinical and research criteria for CAS .	
22909774-2	Each of the two patients in the current report completed a 2-h assessment protocol that provided information on their cognitive , language , speech , oral mechanism , motor , and developmental histories and performance .	
20332304-8	Tumor incidence is reduced from 80% in mice treated with azoxymethane ( AOM ) + DSS to 20% in mice treated with AOM + DSS + resveratrol ( 300 ppm ) .	
20332304-9	Tumor multiplicity also decreased with resveratrol treatment .	
22797064-0	Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression has a role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) .	
22797064-1	The histone methyltransferase MMSET/WHSC1 ( Multiple Myeloma SET domain ) is overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors , but its mechanism of action has not been defined .	
22797064-6	Among a panel of EMT-promoting genes analyzed , TWIST1 expression was strongly activated in response to MMSET .	
22797064-7	Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MMSET binds to the TWIST1 locus and leads to an increase in H3K36me2 , suggesting a direct role of MMSET in the regulation of this gene .	
22797064-4	Knockdown of MMSET in DU145 and PC-3 tumor cells decreased cell proliferation , colony formation in soft agar and strikingly diminished cell migration and invasion .	11 1
22797064-5	Conversely , overexpression of MMSET in immortalized , non-transformed RWPE-1 cells promoted cell migration and invasion , accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .	11 1
20332304-0	Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that exhibits pleiotropic health beneficial effects , including anti-inflammatory , cardio-protective , and cancer-protective activities .	
20332304-1	It is recognized as one of the more promising natural molecules in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders .	
20332304-2	Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic , chronic inflammatory disease of the colon associated with a high colon cancer risk .	
20332304-3	Here , we used a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) mouse model of colitis , which resembles human ulcerative colitis pathology .	
20332304-4	Resveratrol mixed in food ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice in a dose-dependent manner .	
20332304-5	Resveratrol significantly improves inflammation score , downregulates the percentage of neutrophils in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lamina propria , and modulates CD3(+) T cells that express tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IFN-gamma .	a a2
20332304-6	Markers of inflammation and inflammatory stress ( p53 and p53-phospho-Ser(15) ) are also downregulated by resveratrol .	a a2
20332304-7	Because chronic colitis drives colon cancer risk , we carried out experiments to determine the chemopreventive properties of resveratrol .	
23300781-4	The results showed that an increased CD68 count and CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio were directly associated with both MMP-11 and TIMP-2 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells at the tumor center ( p = 0.041 and p = 0.025 for CD68 count and p = 0.001 and p = 0.045 for ratio , respectively for MMP-11 and TIMP-2 ) .	a 21 a1 2 a2
23251422-2	Herein , we assessed the genome-wide distribution of repetitive DNA sequences in the Mycobacterium smegmatis , Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli genomes , and determined the types and frequencies of genetic instability induced by direct and inverted repeats , both in the presence and in the absence of HR , NHEJ , and SSA .	
23269235-9	Thus , sunitinib-induced autophagy is dependent on the suppression of mTORC1 signaling and the formation of ULK1/2-Atg13-FIP200 complexes .	82 8
23269235-8	Moreover , inhibition of autophagy by siRNAs targeting Atg13 or by pharmacological inhibition with ammonium chloride , enhanced both sunitinib-induced apoptosis and anti-proliferation .	82 81 8
21179939-1	Currently , a major concern is that with the increasing use and production of these materials , there may be increased health risks to exposed workers .	
23269235-5	Here , we demonstrated that sunitinib significantly increased the levels of LC3-II , concomitant with a decrease of p62 in PC12 cells .	
23269235-4	Indeed , direct mTORC1 inhibition initiates ULK1/2 autophosphorylation and subsequent Atg13 and FIP200 phosphorylation , inducing autophagy .	
23269235-7	Furthermore , Atg13 knockdown significantly reduced its protein level , which in turn abolished sunitinib-induced autophagy .	82 8
23269235-6	Following sunitinib treatment , immunofluorescent imaging revealed a marked increased punctate LC3-II distribution .	
23269235-1	Previously , we demonstrated that sunitinib directly inhibited mTORC1 signaling in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells .	
23269235-0	Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that mainly targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors , and recently , it has been shown to be an active agent for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas .	
23269235-3	It is of note that inhibition of mTORC1 is a prerequisite for autophagy induction .	
23028984-6	These data identify c-Myc as a positive regulator of the pro-tumoral program of TAMs and suggest c-Myc inactivation as an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy .	
23258740-10	CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that Akt inhibitor AZD5363 , synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy , chloroquine , to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in PCa models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363 , providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients .	82 81 8
21123967-4	To evaluate the cell cycle , we used an FITC BrdU Flow kit and conducted analysis by flow cytometry .	
11872299-14	The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 was modified by radiation and was associated with cellular response to radiation , but this depended on the pretreatment level of cyclin D1 expression .	9 51 511 5 91
11872299-15	These findings may have important clinical implications : The pretreatment assessment of cyclin D1 expression could serve as a useful predictor of radiotherapy outcome and assist in selecting an effective treatment modality .	
11872299-10	A 15-Gy dose reduced constitutive expression of cyclin D1 in the radiosensitive OCa-I tumors , but had no influence on expression of cyclin D1 in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors .	91 9
11872299-11	In contrast , 15 Gy increased the expression of p27 in radiosensitive tumors and reduced it in radioresistant tumors .	511 5 51
11872299-12	Radiation induced no significant apoptosis or change in the percentage of PCNA-positive ( proliferating ) cells in SCC-VII tumors with high cyclin D1 levels , but it induced significant apoptosis and a decrease in the percentage of proliferating cells in OCa-I tumors with low cyclin D1 expression .	91 81 9 8
11872299-13	CONCLUSION Our findings show a positive correlation between cyclin D1 expression and tumor radioresistance .	91 9
22843031-0	Metformin , one of the most widely used antidiabetic drugs , has recently been associated with potential antitumorigenic effects .	
21123967-5	The combination of Ara-C and VP-16 significantly enhanced the observed effects compared with those of Ara-C or VP-16 alone .	
22843031-1	In this study , we evaluated the possible cytotoxic impact of combined low doses of metformin and ionizing radiation ( IR ) on 2human hepatoma cell lines .	
22843031-2	The cytotoxic effect of metformin combined with IR was subsequently determined by clonogenic survival and cell cycle assays , assessment of mitochondrial complexI and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) activity , measurement of cellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) levels , comet assay and analyses of the formation and disappearance of phosphorylated histone H2AX ( γ-H2AX ) protein .	
12537564-6	RESULTS Using CGMA , 104 HCC gene-expression microarray profiles were analyzed .	
12537564-7	CGMA identified 13 regions of frequent cytogenetic change in the HCC samples .	6
12537564-4	A technique we have called comparative genomic microarray analysis ( CGMA ) predicts regions of cytogenetic change by searching for regional gene-expression biases .	
12537564-5	CGMA was applied to HCC gene-expression profiles to identify regions of frequent cytogenetic change and to identify genes whose expression is misregulated within these regions .	
12537564-2	In many cases , however , the gene(s) that drive the selection are unknown .	
12537564-3	Although techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) have traditionally been used to identify cytogenetic aberrations , it might also be possible to identify them indirectly from gene-expression studies .	
12537564-0	BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a leading cause of death worldwide .	
12537564-1	Frequent cytogenetic abnormalities that occur in HCC suggest that tumor-modifying genes ( oncogenes or tumor suppressors ) may be driving selection for amplification or deletion of these particular genetic regions .	
23161172-4	However , it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells , i.e. , intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis .	1 12
23161172-5	OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro .	11 1
23161172-6	For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression , we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) , both of which are involved in tumor progression .	
23161172-7	Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin α1 , integrin α4 , integrin α5 , integrin α6 , and MMP9 .	
23161172-0	Olfactomedin 4 ( OLFM4 ) is highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and has an anti-apoptotic function .	
23161172-1	The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive .	
12537564-8	Ten of these regions have been detected in previous CGH studies ( +lq , -4q , +6p , -8p , +8q , -13q , -16q , -17p , +17q , +20q ) .	
12537564-9	CGMA identified three additional regions that have not been previously identified by CGH ( +5q , +12q , +19p ) .	
20392992-5	Mitogenic signaling pathways were affected by 3BP but not by IAA .	
20392992-4	RESULTS The results show that the inhibitors lowered cellular survival and increased cellular necrosis .	83 8
20392992-7	Thus , a combination of agents that inhibit both energy production and cell signaling may provide a novel and effective approach to target pancreatic cancer effectively .	
20392992-6	CONCLUSION We conclude that there may be a cross-talk between signaling pathways and glycolysis in regulating pancreatic cancer cell survival and signaling .	31 3
20392992-1	The effects of inhibiting glycolysis using metabolic inhibitors iodoacetate ( IAA ) , an inhibitor of GAPDHase , and 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , an inhibitor of hexokinase-II , on survival and signaling of pancreatic cancer cells ( Panc-1 ) were investigated .	
20392992-0	BACKGROUND AND AIM The importance of glycolysis in cancer cells is well documented .	
20392992-3	Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) assay was used to analyze the induced necrosis and protein levels were evaluated using Western blot analysis .	
20392992-2	MATERIALS AND METHODS Cellular survival was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay .	
22876840-0	BACKGROUND MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are short , non-coding RNAs ( nt ) that play important roles in the pathogenesis of human diseases by negatively regulating gene expression .	
22876840-1	Although miR-196a has been implicated in several other cancers , its role in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is unknown .	
22876840-2	The aim of the present study was to examine the expression pattern of miR-196a in NSCLC and its clinical significance , as well as its biological role in tumor progression .	
22876840-3	METHODS Expression of miR-196a was analyzed in 34 NSCLC tissues and five NSCLC cell lines by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) .	
22876840-4	The effect of DNA methylation on miR-196a expression was investigated by 5-aza-2-deoxy-cytidine treatment and bisulfite sequencing .	
22876840-5	The effect of miR-196a on proliferation was evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays , and cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell assays .	
22876840-6	Analysis of target protein expression was determined by western blotting .	
22876840-7	Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed to confirm the action of miR-196a on downstream target genes , including HOXA5 .	
23304196-1	Therefore , we investigated the effects of a less-calcemic 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) analog , 19-nor-2α-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3 )(MART-10 ) , on ER+MCF-7 cells .	
22544226-4	Correspondingly , enhanced telomerase activity is observed upon overexpression of HMGB1 in MEFs .	
22544226-5	HMGB1 physically interacts with both TERT and TR , as well as with active telomerase complex in vitro .	
22544226-6	However , direct interaction of HMGB1 with telomerase is most likely not accountable for the observed higher telomerase activity in HMGB1-containing cells , as revealed from the inability of purified HMGB1 protein to stimulate telomerase activity in vitro .	
22544226-7	While no transcriptional silencing of TERT is observed in HMGB1 KO MEFs , levels of TR are diminished ( providing possible explanation for the observed lower telomerase activity in HMGB1 KO cells .	
22544226-0	Telomere repeats are added onto chromosome ends by telomerase , consisting of two main core components : a catalytic protein subunit ( telomerase reverse trancriptase , TERT ) , and an RNA subunit ( telomerase RNA , TR ) .	
22544226-1	Here , we report for the first time evidence that HMGB1 ( a chromatin-associated protein in mammals , acting as a DNA chaperone in transcription , replication , recombination , and repair ) can modulate cellular activity of mammalian telomerase .	
22544226-2	Knockout of the HMGB1 gene ( HMGB1 KO ) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) results in chromosomal abnormalities , enhanced colocalization of \u03b3-H2AX foci at telomeres , and a moderate shortening of telomere lengths .	
22544226-3	HMGB1 KO MEFs also exhibit significantly ( >5-fold ) lower telomerase activity than the wild-type MEFs .	
23383661-2	A total of 318 patients with HBV-associated HCC and 234 patients with chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) were studied .	
22544226-8	Interestingly , knockout of the HMGB2 gene elevates telomerase activity ( in MEFs , suggesting that the two closely related proteins of the HMGB family , HMGB1 and HMGB2 , have opposite effects on telomerase activity in the cell .	
22544226-9	The ability of HMGB1 to modulate cellular activity of telomerase and to maintain telomere integrity can help to understand some aspects of the protein involvement in chromosome stability and cancer .	
24139416-2	Previous studies indicate that a mutation of the threonine residue at position 34 ( Thr34Ala ) of survivin generates a dominant-negative mutant that induces apoptosis , inhibits angiogenesis , and suppresses highly metastatic breast carcinoma in mouse models .	
12530531-1	Following our previous demonstration that sulforaphane induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human T lymphoblastoid Jurkat leukemia cells and increases p53 and bax protein expression , we tested sulforaphane on non-transformed phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes .	
12530531-0	Despite experimental evidence that sulforaphane can exert chemopreventive effects , whether these effects are specific for neoplastic cells is not known .	
12530531-3	Moreover , sulforaphane induced apoptosis ( and also necrosis ) , mediated by an increase in the expression of p53 .	83 81 8
12530531-2	Here , we demonstrate that sulforaphane arrested cell cycle progression in G , phase , through a decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D3 .	91 9
1281999-5	We suggest that the synergism between VEGF and bFGF plays an important role in the control of angiogenesis in vivo .	71 7 711
1281999-4	These results demonstrate that like bFGF , VEGF induces an angiogenic response via a direct effect on endothelial cells , and that by acting in concert , these two cytokines have a potent synergistic effect on the induction of angiogenesis in vitro .	71 7 711
24139416-4	The metastasis rate was compared between each group in order to find a survivin-targeted therapy against lymphangiogenesis in its earliest stages .	
24139416-7	We detected the apoptotic index , microvessel density ( MVD ) , lymphatic microvessel density ( LMVD ) , and the expression of VEGF-D with immunohistochemistry .	
12533047-4	The former are the expression of a slow but progressive release of angiogenic factors due to chronic , progressive stimulation of MC degranulation , while the latter contain tryptase , an angiogenic factor .	71 7 711
12533047-5	These two ultrastructural data confirm the important role played by MC in the angiogenesis associated with progression in B-NHL .	7 71
12533047-2	An extensive ultrastructural study has been made of representative samples of 30 B-NHL and 10 benign lymphadenopathies .	
12533047-3	A heterogeneous population of MC characterized by the presence of granules with a semilunar aspect and containing scrolls was observed .	
12533047-0	Mast cells ( MC ) are critical for a number of pathological conditions , including acute and chronic inflammation and tumor angiogenesis .	
12533047-1	We have previously demonstrated that in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( B-NHL ) angiogenesis is correlated with total methachromatic and tryptase-positive MC and that both counts increase in step with the increase in malignancy , whereas the role of MC in malignant lymph nodes is not fully clear .	
23065281-2	In addition , RNAi was used to knockdown the expression of the ZEB1 gene in Human HCC827 cells ; subsequently , changes in the invasive ability of the resultant cells were studied .	
23065281-3	The positive rates of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs in LSCC tissues were 69.2 and 38.5% , respectively .	
23065281-0	This study intended to investigate the expression of the ZEB1 and E-cadherin proteins in lung squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC ) tissues and to examine the clinicopathological correlation between protein levels and LSCC .	
23065281-1	RT-PCR and Western blot were used to examine the expression of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs and proteins in LSCC tissues as well as in adjacent normal tissues , and then analyze the relationship between the clinicopathological characteristics and the expression changes of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs in LSCC .	
23065281-6	On the contrary , E-cadherin expression was significantly lower in LSCC tissues than that in the neighboring normal tissue ( p<0.05 ) .	
23065281-7	It was lower in patients with lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis compared to patients without metastatic disease ( p<0.05 ) .	1 12
23065281-4	They differed significantly from the corresponding positive rates in the adjacent normal lung tissues ( 15.4 and 80.8% , p<0.05 ) .	
23065281-5	There was a negative correlation between the protein levels of ZEB1 and E-cadherin in LSCC tissues ( r=-0.714 , p<0.001 ) ; in addition , it was found that ZEB1 protein expression in LSCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the neighboring normal lung tissues ( p<0.05 ) , and its expression was also significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastases and distant metastases compared to those patients without metastatic disease ( p<0.05 ) .	1 12
12489111-12	Furthermore , activation of IQ resulted in higher adduct levels compared with PhIP for both activation pathways .	61 611 6
12489111-13	Overall , adduct levels were higher in single-stranded DNA than double-stranded DNA .	612 611 61 6
12489111-10	In contrasts , DNA adduct analysis by means of ( 32)P-postlabeling showed similar adduct patterns for S9 and PHS in single-stranded and double-stranded salmon testes DNA after incubation with PhIP , indicating the ultimate formation of a common reactive intermediate .	612 611 61 6
12489111-11	For IQ , activation by PHS led to an additional adduct spot that was not present after S9 activation .	61 611 6
12489111-14	Our results showed that the hepatic and extrahepatic pathways resulted in different primary metabolites , while the ultimate formation of a similar reactive intermediate for PhIP , possibly an arylnitrenium ion , suggested that both pathways could play an important role in the onset of carcinogenesis .	
22870112-2	However , only a few studies have investigated the association between IGF-1 levels and childhood cancer risk .	
22870112-3	We aimed to compare the IGF-1 serum level in children with de novo malignancies to healthy children , and to assess its relationship with cancer type , stage , metastasis and different disease characteristics .	
22870112-0	Overexpression of growth factors and/or their receptors is a common event in malignancy and provides the underlying mechanisms for one of the hallmarks of cancer , uncontrolled proliferation .	
22870112-1	Mounting evidence suggests that IGF-1 is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon , breast , prostate and lung .	
22870112-6	Estimation of the serum level of IGF-1 was carried out in the two groups using ELISA .	
22870112-7	Our results showed that children with cancer had significantly higher levels of IGF-1 than healthy controls of the same age and gender .	9 92
22870112-4	The study was carried out on 100 children ; 50 children with de novo malignancies and 50 healthy children of matched age and gender as a control group .	
22870112-5	The patients were subjected to a routine work-up for their cancers according to our local standards .	
14694722-6	If these DNA adducts are not repaired or are mis-repaired before cell duplication , the gene mutation and chemical damage would happen .	63 611 61 6
14694722-7	No adduct reactions are seen among other metabolites of styrene .	61 611 6
14694722-4	CONCLUSIONS Styrene formed adduct with DNA through its active center metabolite--SO after entering the body .	61 611 6
14694722-5	SO combined with DNA at O6 , N2 positions of dGMP to form adducts .	61 611 6
14694722-2	The SO-DNA adducts by 32P-post labeled method , the chemical structures of SO-DNA adducts by GC-MS and NMR were also studied .	
14694722-3	RESULTS SO combined with DNA at O6 , N2 positions of dGMP to form six adducts , but styrene , urinary mandalic acid , phenylglyoxalic acid and mercapturic acid of styrene did not react with DNA to form adduct .	61 611 6
14694722-0	OBJECTIVE To explore the adduct characteristics of styrene and DNA .	
12139732-10	In the largest group of patients , solid organ transplants , no significant clinical or biological characteristics that predicted outcome were identified .	
23271722-6	Thus , p38α and its target HSP25/HSP27 appear to play a conserved and critical hepatoprotective function by curtailing ROS accumulation in liver parenchymal cells engaged in oxidative metabolism of exogenous chemicals .	a21 a2 a
23271722-1	In this study , we examined whether the stress-activated protein kinase p38α ( Mapk14 ) controls ROS metabolism and development of fibrosis and cancer in mice given thioacetamide to induce chronic liver injury .	
23271722-0	Most hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC ) develop in the context of severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis caused by chronic liver inflammation , which also results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
12577239-12	While the dose responses for angiostatin production and metastases inhibition by amifostine are well correlated , the precise mechanism of action underlying these phenomena is unclear but is suggestive of a redox driven process(es) .	
12577239-11	The enhanced ability of relatively low doses of amifostine to inhibit spontaneous metastases formation suggests that effective antimetastatic therapies with amifostine can be designed with minimal toxic side effects .	
12577239-10	In contrast , a dose of 200-mg/kg amifostine administered intraperitoneally under these conditions had no measurable effect on angiostatin serum levels in this animal system .	
20530905-3	Flow cytometry and western blot studies indicated that XQ2 induces G2/M arrest and a caspase-dependent apoptosis in A549 cells .	51 5 511 8 81
20530905-2	Here we investigated a synthetic TPZ derivative , N-ethoxymethyl-3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide ( XQ2 ) , a novel compound that induced anti-cancer effects both in normoxia and in hypoxia , cell proliferation assay found that XQ2 exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the tested cancer cell lines both in normoxia and in hypoxia .	
20530905-1	It controls various levels of regulation in tumor progression and results in tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy .	
20530905-0	Hypoxia is one of the inevitable circumstances of various tumors .	
20530905-5	Taken together , our data suggest that XQ2 exerted anticancer action by suppressing the ROS level and triggering cell-cycle arrest and the caspase-dependent pathway , which is associated with apoptosis .	9 51 91 5 511 8 81
20530905-4	Additionally , intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) appear to play a key role in the anticancer effect of XQ2 in hypoxia .	
23272129-9	Our findings suggest that the soluble EGF-like domain containing CD93 protein is a novel angiogenic factor acting on the endothelium .	71 7 711
22753722-5	These results suggest that down-regulation of Notch-1 , via inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathways by delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin , in combination , could provide a potential novel approach for tumor arrest in NSCLC , while lowering the effective dose of cisplatin .	
22753722-4	This was associated with a decrease in NF-κB DNA binding activity , decrease in Notch-1 , Hes-1 , Bcl-2 and increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP expressions .	
22753722-3	Treatment with a combination of delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent , significant inhibition of cell growth , migration , invasiveness , and induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells , as compared to the single agents .	11 1 9 8 81
22753722-2	The objective of this study was to investigate whether delta-tocotrienol , could enhance the anticancer effects of cisplatin .	
22753722-1	Previously , we demonstrated that delta-tocotrienol inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation , invasion and induces apoptosis by down-regulation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway .	
22753722-0	Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , accounting for 80% of lung cancers , is the leading cause of all cancer deaths .	
23304196-0	Hormone antagonist therapy for estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer patients post radical surgery and radiation therapy has a poor prognosis and also causes bone loss. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] is a potent antitumor agent in pre-clinical studies , but caused hypercalcemia when its effective antitumor doses were used .	
23383661-9	G1896A in the precore region and C1653T mutation in the X region of genotype C2 HBV are important risk factors for HCC development .	63 6
20214814-10	Furthermore , the preservation of the blood DCs compartment in PDAC patients seems to benefit their ability to control the disease and survival .	
23383661-8	In multivariate analysis , T1653 and A1896 were revealed to be independent risk factors for HCC development .	
22681312-8	In conclusion , we demonstrate that GvHD-related inflammation reduced Treg-cell numbers at the tumour sites , which may in turn help to explain the observation that patients with GvHD have a lower risk of tumour relapse .	a1 a
23204518-6	Levels of VEGF and CCL4 were increased in CSF of GBM and significantly correlated with the levels of cleaved OPN .	
22681312-2	We observed that induction of graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) significantly reduced the abundance of luc(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T ( Treg ) cells in the tumour tissue , which is indicative of impaired or over-ridden tumour recruitment signals towards Treg cells .	
22681312-3	Analysis of the intestines and liver revealed chemokines and purine nucleotides as candidates for attracting Treg to these sites of inflammation .	a1 a2 a
22681312-0	The therapeutic principle of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation ( allo-HCT ) is based on an active donor immune system that eliminates host-derived tumour cells .	
22681312-1	We hypothesized that in addition to the alloantigen-driven anti-tumour response , disruption of the immunological microenvironment within the tumour is responsible for its elimination after allo-HCT .	
22681312-6	P2Y2 was found to be expressed on Treg cells , and we found a partial reduction of GvHD prevention when P2Y2(-/-) rather than P2Y2(+/+) Treg cells were given .	a1 a
22681312-7	Exogenous local inflammation reduced Treg-cell accumulation in the tumour , suggesting a potential clinical approach to prevent Treg-cell-mediated tumour escape .	a1 a
22681312-4	Despite its expression on tissue-residing Treg cells , the chemokine receptor CCR3 was not critical for Treg-cell function following allo-HCT .	
22681312-5	Extracellular ATP can attract immune cells via P2Y2 .	a1 a
12223346-0	Growth of Caco-2 and many cancer cells is inhibited by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) .	
12223346-1	Whereas TGF-beta 1 inhibits normal colonic epithelial cell growth , most human colon cancer-derived cells , including Caco-2 and SW480 cells , are resistant to it .	
12223346-2	The mechanisms underlying these antiproliferative actions and resistance to TGF-beta growth inhibition are largely unknown .	
12223346-3	We observed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] sensitized Caco-2 and SW480 cells to TGF-beta 1 growth inhibitory effects .	
12223346-4	Versus 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) alone , the combination of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and TGF-beta 1 significantly reduced cell numbers .	
12223346-5	Also , the amount of active TGF-beta 1 was increased ( by this secosteroid in conditioned media from Caco-2 cells .	
12223346-6	The 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) increased the expression of IGF-II receptors ( IGF-IIR ) , which facilitated activation of latent TGF-beta 1 , and was found to activate TGF-beta signaling in Caco-2 cells .	
12223346-7	By using neutralizing antibodies to human TGF-beta 1 , we showed that this cytokine contributes to secosteroid-induced inhibition of Caco-2 cell growth .	
12223346-8	Also , 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was found to enhance the type I TGF-beta receptor mRNA and protein abundance in Caco-2 cells .	
12223346-9	Whereas the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced sensitization of Caco-2 cells to TGF-beta 1 was IGF-IIR independent , the type I TGF-beta 1 receptor was required for this sensitization .	
23137061-8	Dysregulation of SC maintenance genes and signaling pathways are common during oncogenesis .	
12242083-4	Since cell proliferation was also reported to be inhibited by calmodulin antagonists , this substance is most promising agent in treatment of cancer by inhibiting both cell proliferation and the glycolytic supply of ATP required for cancer cell growth .	
12242083-3	These findings suggest that clotrimazole causes a reduction in glycolysis and ATP levels , which eventually leads to cell destruction after 3 h of treatment .	
12242083-2	We found that clotrimazole induced a significant , dose- and time-dependent reduction in the levels of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate , fructose 1,6-bisphosphate , ATP , and cell viability .	31 3
12242083-1	We investigated here the effect of clotrimazole ( 1-(alpha-2-chlorotrityl)imidazole ) , the antifungal azole derivative , which was recently recognized as calmodulin antagonist , on the levels of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate , the two stimulatory signal molecules of glycolysis , and on ATP content and cell viability in LL/2 Lewis lung carcinoma cells and CT-26 colon adenocarcinoma cells .	
12242083-0	Glycolysis is known to be the primary energy source in most cancer cells .	
23209436-10	We propose that loss of Fhit expression in precancerous lesions is the first step in the initiation of genomic instability , linking alterations at common fragile sites to the origin of genome instability .	6
23255243-11	CONCLUSIONS: : Akt plays an important role in the radiation-induced tumor-infiltrating Treg survival in Hca .	
23255243-10	Tregs with high levels of Akt still preserve the immune suppressor function .	2 22
23304206-1	However , the molecular mechanisms of RA actions on cancer cells remain diverse .	
23166510-2	Pre-pachytene piRNAs are mostly derived from retrotransposons and required for their silencing .	
20336315-7	In the lung cancer xenograft model , average tumor volume in the group treated with both cisplatin and shRNA was statistically lower than those of other groups ( P < 0.05 ) .	
12239968-5	The chi 2 test or Student's t test was used for statistical analysis .	
12239968-4	Patient data was postoperatively reviewed regarding age , gender , tumor size , depth of invasion , histologic differentiation , macroscopic classification and anatomic level of lymph node metastasis .	
12239968-7	RESULTS Lymph node metastasis was observed in 19 cases ( 11% ) .	1 12
12239968-6	Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis .	
12239968-1	However , lymph node metastasis is a major poor prognostic factor influencing tumor recurrence and survival .	
12239968-0	BACKGROUND/AIMS Endoscopic mucosal resection and laparoscopic wedge resection have become more common in the treatment of early gastric cancer .	
12239968-3	METHODOLOGY From 1982 to 1998 , 181 patients of early gastric cancer underwent primary surgery and were included in the study .	
12239968-2	To predict the risk of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer , the authors conducted a study to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of early gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis .	
12239968-9	The macroscopic classification had no predictive value .	
12239968-8	Early gastric cancer with size larger than 4 cm ( P < 0.05 ) , with submucosal invasion ( P < 0.01 ) , and with poor differentiation ( P < 0.05 ) was associated with higher risk of lymph node metastasis .	1
23317200-3	MTT assays showed that luteolin had obvious cytotoxicity on Eca109 with an IC50 of 70.7�1.72 μM at 24 h .	
23317200-2	In this study , we investigated the effect of luteolin on cell cycling and apoptosis in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line Eca109 cells .	
23317200-1	However , the antiproliferative potential of luteolin is not fully understood .	
23317200-0	Luteolin is a plant flavonoid which exhibits anti-oxidative , anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects .	
12441637-9	The preterminal exposure and the adaptive response test may activate different DNA repair mechanisms .	62 6
23317200-5	Luteolin induced apoptosis of Eca109 cells was demonstrated by AO/EB staining assay and annexin V-FITC/PI staining .	8 81
23317200-4	Luteolin arrested cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase and prevented entry into S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. as assessed by FCM .	91 9
20336315-1	In this study , the effects of combined treatment with cisplatin ( DDP ) and a plasmid that expresses a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting PKM2 on the growth of human A549 xenograft lung cancer model were investigated .	
20588232-7	Women with advanced cancer had significantly higher serum IL-6 , IL-10 and TGF-beta1 levels than women with early stages or benign tumors .	a 2 a2 21
20122407-4	Indeed , purified HELQ-1 and RFS-1 independently bind to and promote the disassembly of RAD-51 from double-stranded , but not single-stranded , DNA filaments via distinct mechanisms in vitro .	
22894905-4	We observed that activation of HIF1α , but not HIF2α , in stromal cells promotes a shift toward aerobic glycolysis , with increased L-lactate production and a loss of mitochondrial activity .	
22894905-5	In a xenograft model , HIF1α-activated fibroblasts promoted the tumor growth of co-injected MDA-MB-231 cells without an increase in angiogenesis .	
22894905-6	Conversely , HIF2α-activated stromal cells did not favor tumor growth and behaved as the empty vector controls .	
22894905-7	Similarly , activation of HIF1α , but not HIF2α , in MDA-MB-231 cells promoted a shift toward aerobic glycolysis , with increased glucose uptake and L-lactate production .	
22894905-0	Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) 1α and 2α are transcription factors responsible for the cellular response to hypoxia .	
22894905-1	The functional roles of HIF1α and HIF2α in cancer are distinct and vary among different tumor types .	
22894905-2	The aim of this study was to evaluate the compartment-specific role(s) of HIF1α and HIF2α in breast cancer .	
22894905-3	To this end , immortalized human fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells carrying constitutively active HIF1α or HIF2α mutants were analyzed with respect to their metabolic function(s) and ability to promote tumor growth in an in vivo setting .	
22894905-8	In contrast , HIF2α activation in cancer cells increased the expression of EGFR , Ras and cyclin D1 , which are known markers of tumor growth and cell cycle progression .	
22894905-9	In a xenograft model , HIF1α activation in MDA-MB-231 cells acted as a tumor suppressor , resulting in an almost 2-fold reduction in tumor mass and volume .	
12441637-2	Genetic predisposition plays an important role in the etiology and development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) .	
21123967-10	An enhancement was confirmed for the combination of Ara-C , VP-16 , and G-CSF for 32Dcl3 and U937 cells but not for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells .	
21123967-11	It was thought that this difference was a result of different responses to G-CSF .	
21123967-12	G-CSF potentiates Ara-C- and VP-16-induced cytotoxicities through apoptosis induction by mobilizing resting G0-G1-phase cells into S phase .	91 81 9 8
12441637-1	There are attempts to find effective assays of both individual DNA repair capacity and genetic instability , and their relation to the cancer risk .	
12441637-0	Genomic instability has long been recognized as the main feature of neoplasia and a factor modulating individual cancer susceptibility .	
12082607-3	BMECs transfected with hTERT alone were functionally and phenotypically normal .	
12082607-2	One hTERT transduced BMEC culture underwent a long proliferative lag before resuming proliferation .	
12082607-1	Transfection with hTERT alone , led to the immortalization of two out of three cultures of bone marrow-derived ECs ( BMECs ) .	4 41
12082607-0	We have modelled multiple stages of malignant transformation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) by overexpressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) , together with SV40 T antigen ( SV40T ) and oncogenic N-ras .	
12082607-7	BMSVTs immortalized with hTERT formed large colonies in vitro and small transient tumours in vivo .	4 41
12082607-6	Transduction of BMSVTs with hTERT resulted in immortalization of 4 out of 4 cultures .	4 41
12082607-5	BMSVTs exhibited a partially transformed phenotype , demonstrating growth factor independence , altered antigen expression and forming tiny , infrequent colonies in vitro .	9 92
12082607-4	BMECs transfected with SV40T ( BMSVTs ) had an extended lifespan , but eventually succumbed to crisis .	
12082607-9	These investigations demonstrate transformation of human ECs to an overtly malignant phenotype .	
12082607-8	BMECs co-expressing SV40T , hTERT and N-ras exhibited an overtly transformed phenotype ; forming very large colonies with an altered morphology and generating rapidly growing tumours in vivo .	
23243586-7	Accordingly , the cytokine and chemokine profile associated with the M2 phenotype was significantly overexpressed in Arf(-/-) macrophages responding to IL-4 .	
22436374-14	The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA .	
22436374-15	CONCLUSIONS EGFR knockdown by siRNA further decreases the cell growth of lung cancer cells that are treated with TKIs or cetuximab alone , confirming that single agent drug targeting does not achieve a maximal biological effect .	
22436374-16	The siRNA inhibits EGFR oncogenic activity that bypasses downstream " resistance " mutations such as KRAS and PTEN .	
22436374-17	The combined treatment of siRNA and EGFR inhibitory agents is additive .	
22436374-10	The cells which showed weak response to TKIs , such as the H1975 cell line containing the T790M resistance mutation , were found to be responsive to siRNA knockdown of EGFR , as were cell lines with downstream TKI resistance mutations .	
22436374-11	The cell line HCC827 , harboring an exon 19 deletion mutation , was more than 10-fold more sensitive to TKI proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction than any of the other cell lines .	63 6 9 8 81
22436374-12	Cetuximab alone had no relevant in vitro activity at concentrations obtainable in the clinic .	
22436374-13	The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines , independent of the EGFR mutation status ( wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation ) .	63 6 9 8 93 81
22843031-3	The combination of metformin and IR caused a much stronger cytotoxicity than the treatment with metformin or IR alone , leading to an decrease in cell viability and increase in the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in the 2hepatoma cell lines .	
22436374-18	The combination of a potent , irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib , with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers , including those with downstream resistance mutations .	
23251606-1	In this study , we aimed to delineate the impact of snake venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NP ) on primary MM cells isolated from patients diagnosed with MM as well as on two MM cell lines , U266 and RPMI 8226 .	
20588232-3	SETTING Tertiary referral hospital .	
23243586-2	We have previously demonstrated that ARF deficiency severely impairs inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo , establishing a role for ARF in the regulation of innate immunity .	
23304253-9	Results .	
12219835-0	The metastatic spread of malignant neoplasms is associated with active migration of cancer cells .	
12219835-1	The migration of neoplastic cells during the metastatic process may be affected by various extracellular factors , including chemoattractants , haptotactic signals , electric fields , substrate anisotropy , and cell-to-cell contacts .	
12219835-2	We examined the effect of homotypic collisions and heterotypic interactions with normal human skin fibroblasts on the motile activity of Walker carcinosarcoma cells .	
12219835-3	It was found that Walker carcinosarcoma cells moving in a dense population neither show contact inhibition of movement when colliding with one another nor increase their motile activity as a result of contact stimulation of motility .	5 52
12219835-4	On the other hand , when plated onto the surface of aligned fibroblasts , Walker carcinosarcoma cells migrated mainly along the long axes of underlying fibroblasts as a result of contact guidance .	
12219835-5	The directional character of movement ( but not the speed of migration ) of Walker carcinosarcoma cells on the surface of aligned fibroblasts was completely effaced by RGD-containing synthetic peptide at a concentration of 1 mg/ml but not by 5 microM verapamil ( selective voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitor ) or 10 microM gadolinium chloride ( non-specific blocker of mechanosensitive ion channels ) .	
12219835-6	The suppression of directional character of migration of tumour cells by RGD-containing peptide was associated with the decrease in the amount of fibronectin macromolecules attached to fibroblasts .	
12219835-7	This suggests that alignment and anisotropic distribution of fibronectin macromolecules may be responsible for contact guidance of tumour cells moving on the surface of fibroblasts .	
20110254-4	Kinetic parameters have also been determined by this method .	
20110254-5	Since different fluorophores were attached to the oligonucleotides containing each lesion , reactions with two types of substrates were analyzed separately in a single tube , by changing the excitation and detection wavelengths .	
20110254-6	These probes were degraded during an incubation with a cell extract .	
20110254-7	Therefore , phosphorothioate linkages were incorporated to protect the probes from nonspecific nucleases , and the base excision repair activity was successfully detected in HeLa cells .	62 6
20110254-0	We have developed fluorescent probes for the detection of strand scission in the excision repair of oxidatively damaged bases .	
20110254-1	They were hairpin-shaped oligonucleotides , each containing an isomer of thymine glycol or 5,6-dihydrothymine as a damaged base in the center , with a fluorophore and a quencher at the 5'- and 3'-ends , respectively .	
20110254-2	Fluorescence was detected when the phosphodiester linkage at the damage site was cleaved by the enzyme , because the short fragment bearing the fluorophore could not remain in a duplex form hybridized to the rest of the molecule at the incubation temperature .	
20110254-3	The substrate specificities of Escherichia coli endonuclease III and its human homolog , NTH1 , determined by using these probes agreed with those determined previously by gel electrophoresis using ( 32)P-labeled substrates .	
20100566-11	This study also emphasizes the importance of protecting MVP solution from light before use in preterm infants .	
23317220-2	Furthermore , this apoptosis was accompanied by reduction of intracellular FAS activity and could be rescued by 25 mM or 50 mM exogenous palmitic acids , the final product of FAS catalyzed synthesis .	8 81
23243586-3	The aim of the present work was to get further insights into the immune functions of ARF and to evaluate its possible contribution to the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 or M2 phenotype .	
20100566-10	These results suggest that photoactivated MVP carries an important toxic load able to damage DNA and induce cell death .	61 6
1311633-0	Induction of the expression of the Mr 67,000 high-affinity laminin receptor gene has been postulated as playing a role in the progression of human tumors to invasive cancers .	
1311633-1	We tested this hypothesis by examining histopathological sections of a large number of epithelial lesions of the genital tract associated with human papillomaviruses .	
1311633-2	In situ hybridization was performed with a riboprobe generated from a laminin receptor complementary DNA .	
1311633-3	Laminin receptor mRNA was expressed primarily in the less differentiated cells in normal squamous tissues and in a spectrum of squamous neoplasms .	9 93
1311633-4	There was no net induction of mRNA per cell in intraepithelial or invasive squamous neoplasms relative to normal tissue .	
1311633-5	In contrast , laminin receptor mRNA was not expressed at a detectable level in normal glands of the uterine cervix but was dramatically induced in morphologically abnormal , human papillomavirus-positive glands , irrespective of the genotype of human papillomaviruses present .	9 93
1311633-6	The induction occurred before any evidence of invasion , and there was no further increase during the transition from adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma .	11 1
1311633-7	We conclude that induction of high-affinity laminin receptor gene expression is associated with the development of malignancies of cervical glandular epithelia , but the increased expression appears to correlate with the proliferative rather than the invasive properties of these cells .	9 93
22909774-5	These are the first reported cases with well-characterized CAS in the 16p11.2 syndrome literature and the first report of this microdeletion in CAS genetics research .	
21123967-8	The addition of G-CSF significantly decreased the percentage of G0/G1-phase cells and significantly increased that of S-phase cells among 32Dcl3 and U937 cells .	91 9
22327365-5	Our results thus suggest the possible application of IKK2 and Timp-1 inhibitors in treating lung cancer .	
23406762-5	Cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity were determined by XTT , MTT and clonogenic assays .	
23406762-4	Formation of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes was assessed by the TARDIS assay , an immunofluorescence technique that employs specific antibodies to DNA topo I or topo II to detect the protein covalently bound to the DNA in individual cells .	
23406762-7	RESULTS Phenylglyoxal induced cellular DNA damage and formation of high levels of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes in cells .	61 6
23406762-6	Apoptosis was assessed by the Annexin V flow cytometry assay .	
23406762-1	The inability of tumor cells to properly repair some types of DNA damage may explain why specific DNA-damaging drugs can selectively kill tumor cells .	
23406762-0	BACKGROUND DNA-damaging compounds ( e.g. , alkylating agents , cytotoxic antibiotics and DNA topoisomerase poisons ) are the most widely used anticancer drugs .	
23406762-3	METHODS Cellular DNA damage was measured by the alkaline comet assay and the \u03b3H2AX focus assay .	
23406762-2	Phenylglyoxal is a dicarbonyl compound known to react with guanidine groups such as that of the DNA base guanine , therefore suggesting that phenylglyoxal could induce DNA damage and have anticancer activity .	
22327365-3	Activation of the Erk signalling pathway and cell proliferation requires Timp-1 and its receptor CD63 .	
20122407-3	Whereas RAD-51-ssDNA filaments assemble at meiotic DSBs with normal kinetics in helq-1 , rfs-1 double mutants , persistence of RAD-51 foci and genetic interactions with rtel-1 suggest a failure to disassemble RAD-51 from strand invasion intermediates .	612 61 6
23406762-9	Phenylglyoxal-induced cell death was partially prevented by catalase pretreatment and was higher in lung cancer cells ( A549 ) than in normal lung fibroblasts ( MRC5 ) .	8
23406762-8	These topoisomerase-DNA complexes were abolished by catalase pretreatment and correlated well with the induction of apoptosis .	8 81
22327365-2	We identified Timp1 , one of the NF-κB target genes , as a key mediator for tumour growth .	
22327365-1	IKK2 depletion in tumour cells significantly attenuated tumour proliferation and significantly prolonged mouse survival .	
11821958-10	This provides a new mechanism for generating signalling diversity and has potential clinical implications in breast cancer .	
22327365-0	Lung cancer is one of the leading cancer malignancies , with a five-year survival rate of only We have developed a lentiviral-vector-mediated mouse model , which enables generation of non-small-cell lung cancer from less than 100 alveolar epithelial cells , and investigated the role of IKK2 and NF-κB in lung-cancer development .	
22948179-9	Taken together , our findings suggest that SHH pathway induces cell migration and invasion through FAK/AKT signaling-mediated MMP-2 and MMP-9 production and activation in liver cancer .	11 1
12426565-4	This strategy suggests a rationale for the multisubunit structure of stimulatory immunoreceptors .	2 21
12426565-2	Here , we report that alternative splicing leads to two distinct NKG2D polypeptides that associate differentially with the DAP10 and KARAP ( also known as DAP12 ) signaling subunits .	
12426565-3	We found that differential expression of these isoforms and of signaling proteins determined whether NKG2D functioned as a costimulatory receptor in the adaptive immune system ( CD8+ T cells ) or as both a primary recognition structure and a costimulatory receptor in the innate immune system ( natural killer cells and macrophages ) .	2 21
12426565-0	Optimal lymphocyte activation requires the simultaneous engagement of stimulatory and costimulatory receptors .	
12426565-1	Stimulatory immunoreceptors are usually composed of a ligand-binding transmembrane protein and noncovalently associated signal-transducing subunits .	
22389673-10	Furthermore , radiation-enhanced Fas and TRAIL-induced cell death lasted as long as 5-days post-irradiation .	8 81
12202630-10	DMSO synchronization represents a model system in which to analyse protein activities regulating G(1) progression and investigate the response of G(1) cells to mutagen treatments .	91 63 9 6
22948179-8	Finally , we found that SHH protein expression was positively correlated with phosphorylatd FAK Tyr397 , phosphorylatd AKT Ser473 , MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expressions in HCC samples .	
23205094-8	In COS1NR cells co-cultured with MSCs under hypoxic conditions , isoproterenol caused a significant increase in proliferation and this effect was inhibited by an anti-interleukin ( IL)-6 antibody .	
23205094-9	A tumor formation assay in syngeneic rats revealed that the systemic administration of MSCs enhances the growth of OS and the effect of MSCs was inhibited by IL-6 neutralization .	
23205094-2	Previously , it has been reported that the systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) increased the engraftment and metastatic colonization of rat osteosarcoma ( OS ) cells .	
23205094-3	In the current study , the effect of MSCs on the hypoxia-induced desensitization of the β2AR in OS cells was investigated .	
23205094-0	The β2-adrenergic receptor ( β2AR ) mediates the effects of chronic stress in several neoplasms , however , β2AR signaling is impaired by hypoxia in various tissues .	
23205094-1	While hypoxia is a common feature significant in the progression of solid tumors , little is known about the effect of hypoxia on β2AR signaling in the tumor microenvironment .	
23205094-6	A sensitivity assay for the β2AR revealed that hypoxia impaired the sensitivity of COS1NR cells , whereas hypoxia did not affect MSCs .	
23205094-7	An immunoassay revealed no significant change in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF1α ) in COS1NR cells , whilst an immunoassay demonstrated a 15% increase in MSCs following isoproterenol stimulation .	
23205094-4	Epinephrine , norepinephrine and isoproterenol increased the cellular proliferation of the rat OS cell line COS1NR and rat MSCs in a dose-dependent and β2AR antagonist-sensitive manner .	9
23205094-5	While isoproterenol had significant proliferative effects on MSCs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions , COS1NR cells did not respond under hypoxic conditions .	
19637241-2	We have recently reported that Nucling regulates the apoptotic pathway by controlling the activation of NF-kappaB as well .	
22909774-1	CAS is the speech disorder identified in a multigenerational pedigree ( 'KE' ) in which half of the members have a mutation in FOXP2 that co-segregates with CAS , oromotor apraxia , and low scores on a nonword repetition task .	
1556770-1	This cyclical requirement for cell division , when not interrupted by the long anovulatory rest periods that occur during pregnancy and lactation , may contribute to the development of ovarian cancer .	
1556770-0	BACKGROUND Ovarian surface epithelial cells undergo several rounds of division to repair the wound created by follicular rupture at the time of ovulation .	
1556770-3	We then tested them for the acquisition of the following four features associated with transformation : 1 ) the loss of contact inhibition , 2 ) the capacity for substrate-independent growth , 3 ) the ability to form tumors when injected subcutaneously and/or intraperitoneally into athymic mice , and 4 ) cytogenetic abnormalities .	
1556770-2	PURPOSE AND METHODS To test this hypothesis , we isolated rat ovarian surface epithelial cells from 10 adult female Fisher rats , initiated two mixed-population and seven clonal cell lines , and repeatedly subcultured these cells in vitro for more than 20 passages .	
1556770-5	Six of the nine late-passage , but none of the early-passage , cell lines tested exhibited a capacity for substrate-independent growth that was augmented in a dose-dependent manner by epidermal growth factor .	9 92
1556770-4	RESULTS Loss of contact inhibition was observed in all nine late-passage cell lines .	5 52
1556770-7	Late-passage clone 7 cells were tumorigenic when 5 x 10(7) cells were injected intraperitoneally .	
1556770-6	Two late-passage cell lines ( clone 2 and mixed-population 2 ) generated tumors in athymic BALB/c mice within 3 weeks following subcutaneous injection of 5 x 10(6) cells , whereas similar numbers of early-passage cells from the same cell lines failed to generate palpable tumors .	
1556770-9	Clone 2 possessed an interstitial deletion , del(5)(q21.3q24) , consistent with the loss of an uncloned putative tumor suppressor gene at 5q22q23 previously reported to reside near the loci for the interferon alpha , interferon beta , and c-jun genes .	
1556770-8	Two of the cell lines analyzed exhibited alterations involving losses of part or all of one member of the chromosome 5 pair .	
1281999-1	Here we demonstrate that VEGF is angiogenic in vitro : when added to microvascular endothelial cells grown on the surface of three-dimensional collagen gels , VEGF induces the cells to invade the underlying matrix and to form capillary-like tubules , with an optimal effect at approximately 2.2nM ( 100ng/ml ) .	71 7 711
22909774-0	We report clinical findings that extend the phenotype of the kb 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome to include a rare , severe , and persistent pediatric speech sound disorder termed Childhood Apraxia of Speech ( CAS ) .	
21123967-9	No significant effect was observed for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells .	
22828138-3	This result is consistent with the previously observed tumor susceptibility of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice .	61 611 6
22828138-2	When mice were fed 100 ppm BP for 28 days , BP-induced DNA damage measured in esophagus , liver and lung was typically higher in Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice , compared with WT mice .	61 6
22909774-6	We discuss implications of findings for issues in both literatures .	
1281999-0	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , also known as vascular permeability factor or vasculotropin , is a recently characterized endothelial-specific mitogen which is angiogenic in vivo .	
22828138-1	DNA damage was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC/ES-MS/MS ) , which measures r7,t8,t9-trihydroxy-c-10-(N ( 2)-deoxyguanosyl)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPdG ) , and a chemiluminescence immunoassay ( CIA ) , using anti-r7,t8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPDE)-DNA antiserum , which measures both BPdG and the other stable BP-DNA adducts .	
22828138-0	We have evaluated DNA damage ( DNA adduct formation ) after feeding benzo[a]pyrene ( BP ) to wild-type ( WT ) and cancer-susceptible Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice deficient in nucleotide excision repair and haploinsufficient for the tumor suppressor p53 .	
23300781-2	We performed an immunohistochemical study counting CD3 , CD20 and CD68 positive cells at the invasive front , in 102 breast carcinomas .	
22828138-7	Therefore , the addition of CHL to a BP-containing diet showed a lack of consistent chemoprotective effect , indicating that oral CHL administration may not reduce PAH-DNA adduct levels consistently in human organs .	61 611 6
22596188-7	However , RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ERα , a negative regulator of CCNG2 , had no effect on TCDD-dependent AHR or NCoA3 recruitment to or expression of CCNG2 .	
22828138-6	The addition of CHL resulted in an increase of BP-DNA adducts in esophagus , liver and lung of WT mice , a lowering of BPdG in esophagi of WT mice and livers of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice and an increase of BPdG in livers of WT mice .	61 611 6
22763454-0	Circulating tumour cells ( CTCs ) shed into blood from primary cancers include putative precursors that initiate distal metastases .	
22828138-5	In an attempt to lower BP-induced DNA damage , we fed the WT and Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice 0.3% chlorophyllin ( CHL ) in the BP-containing diet for 28 days .	
22763454-1	Although these cells are extraordinarily rare , they may identify cellular pathways contributing to the blood-borne dissemination of cancer .	
22828138-4	BPdG , the major DNA adduct associated with tumorigenicity , was the primary DNA adduct formed in esophagus ( a target tissue in the mouse ) , whereas total BP-DNA adducts predominated in higher levels in the liver ( a non-target tissue in the mouse ) .	61 611 6
22763454-2	Here , we adapted a microfluidic device for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model and subjected CTCs to single-molecule RNA sequencing , identifying Wnt2 as a candidate gene enriched in CTCs .	
11742853-7	The observed attenuation of LPS-induced and stress-associated fevers in Zucker fatty rats in the cold agrees with the literature data showing that brown adipose tissue ( the major heat production effector ) is morphologically and functionally defective in these rats .	
22337862-4	The characteristic scale of variation in \u03ba is up to at least nucleotides in Drosophila and nucleotides in Hominidae .	
22337862-5	Genome segments with locally elevated mutation rates possess lower values of \u03ba ; however , a substantial fraction of variation in \u03ba cannot be directly explained by the local mutation rates .	
22337862-2	We used data on interspecies divergence and intraspecies polymorphism in Drosophila and Hominidae to analyze variation of the average rate of the 12 possible kinds of single-nucleotide mutations and in the transition/transversion ratio \u03ba at single-nucleotide resolution .	
22337862-3	Both the average mutation rate and \u03ba vary by a factor of between nucleotide sites .	
22337862-0	Mutation rate varies between sites in the genome .	
12450390-10	We conclude from this study that the mutation potential of dG-AAF and dG-AF depends on the structure of the adduct , the sequence context of the lesion , and the host cell used for the experiment .	61 63 611 6
22864932-5	RESULTS Data were collected on 369 patients with breast cancer .	
12579213-9	In the tumors larger than 10 cm with vascular invasion , NK cell number was lower around the tumor ( p>0.05 ) .	
22864932-7	Overall , 32% of patients had invasive cancer in their reexcision specimens , and 51% of those with the TN subtype had residual invasive disease on reexcision compared with 30% to 31% for other subtypes .	11 1
22864932-6	The median age was 57 years , median tumor size was 1.5 cm , 36% had positive margins , 32% had positive lymph nodes , 73.5% had the luminal A subtype , 9.5% had the luminal B subtype , 4.5% were Her2-enriched , and 12.5% were TN .	
22864932-1	METHODS A review of pathologic specimens was performed for women with invasive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy followed by reexcision .	
22864932-0	BACKGROUND To assess the potential mechanisms that may underlie increased local failure in triple negative ( TN ) breast cancers , an analysis was performed of the risk of residual carcinoma after lumpectomy with correlation to pathologic factors , including molecular phenotype .	
22864932-3	Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate for associations between pathologic features of the lumpectomy specimen and reexcision findings .	
20307623-5	Oxidative stress was evaluated in terms of MTT reduction , protein peroxidation and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) formation .	a21 a2 a
22389673-9	Sub-lethal tumor cell irradiation alone exhibited minimal cell death , but effectively sensitized three of three colorectal carcinoma cells to both TRAIL and Fas-induced apoptosis , but not LTβR-induced death .	8 81
22389673-8	Increased expression of DRs was observed 2 days post-irradiation and remained elevated 7-days post irradiation .	
1281999-2	When compared to basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) at equimolar ( 0.5nM ) concentrations , VEGF was about half as potent .	71 7 711
22389673-2	Previous studies indicate that radiation can modify gene expression within tumor cells and increase tumor cell sensitivity to immune attack .	
22389673-1	Tumor cells , however , often exhibit DR-signaling resistance .	
22389673-0	BACKGROUND Death receptors ( DR ) of the TNF family function as anti-tumor immune effector molecules .	
22389673-7	We found that radiation increased surface expression of Fas , DR4 and DR5 but not LTβR or TNF-R1 in these cells .	8 81
22389673-6	The longevity of these changes and the underlying molecular mechanism of irradiation in sensitizing diverse colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis were also examined .	
22389673-5	The functional significance of sub-lethal doses of radiation in enhancing tumor cell susceptibility to DR-induced apoptosis was determined by in vitro functional sensitivity assays .	
22389673-4	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The ability of radiation to modulate the expression of multiple death receptors ( Fas/CD95 , TRAILR1/DR4 , TRAILR2/DR5 , TNF-R1 and LTβR ) was examined in colorectal tumor cells .	
12415261-7	This approach may provide a new strategy for the rational design of cancer therapies .	
12415261-6	Our strategy circumvents problems in targeting of genetically unstable tumor cells .	
12415261-5	Angiogenesis in the tumor vasculature was suppressed without impairment of fertility , neuromuscular performance or hematopoiesis , albeit with a slight delay in wound healing .	7 71
12415261-4	CTL-mediated killing of endothelial cells indicated breaking of peripheral immune tolerance against this self antigen , resulting in markedly reduced dissemination of spontaneous and experimental pulmonary metastases .	1 2 12 21
12415261-3	This vaccine effectively protected mice from lethal challenges with melanoma , colon carcinoma and lung carcinoma cells and reduced growth of established metastases in a therapeutic setting .	1 12
12415261-2	Targeting occurs through upregulated vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( FLK-1 ) of proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature .	
12415261-1	Here we describe a novel , oral DNA vaccine that targets stable , proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature rather than tumor cells .	
12415261-0	Tumor cells are elusive targets for immunotherapy due to their heterogeneity and genetic instability .	
23254306-6	This finding is novel to our study .	
23254306-7	Under both low- and high-DNA damaged conditions , 50% CDK deficiency can cause 65% increase in senescence in a heterogeneous cell population .	61 42 4 6
23254306-4	For this , we focus on the behaviour of CycE , whose peak response indicates G1/S transition , for several reduced CDK2 levels in healthy as well as two DNA-damage conditions to calculate the probability ( \u03b2 ) or the percentage of CDK2 deficient cells passing G1/S checkpoint ( (1-\u03b2) indicates level of senescence ) .	
23254306-5	Results show that 50% CDK2 deficiency can cause senescence in all healthy cells in a fairly uniform cell population ; whereas , most healthy cells ( \u224867% ) in a heterogeneous population escape senescence .	42 4
23254306-2	We first demonstrate the suitability of the mathematical model to explore senescence by highlighting the overlap between senescence pathways and those involved in G1/S transition and DNA damage signal transduction .	
23254306-3	We then investigate the effect of CDK2 deficiency on senescence in healthy cells , followed by effectiveness of CDK2 deficiency in triggering senescence in DNA damaged cells .	
23254306-0	Lowering the threshold of cellular senescence , the process employed by cells to thwart abnormal cell proliferation , though inhibition of CDK2 or Skp2 ( regulator of CDK inhibitors ) has been recently suggested as a potential avenue for cancer treatment .	
23254306-1	In this study , we employ a published mathematical model of G1/S transition involving the DNA-damage signal transduction pathway to conduct carefully constructed computational experiments to highlight the effectiveness of manipulating cellular senescence in inhibiting damaged cell proliferation .	
23304253-8	The influences of WEV and WEV+NP were assessed with flow cytometry analysis .	
22809334-10	The distances generated in the resulting GB1 structural models match the most probable DEER distance within Å .	
22809334-11	The results are interesting as they indicate by direct experimental measurement that the rotameric states of R1 found in this crystal provide a very close match to the most probable distance measured by DEER .	
22564725-2	High expression of CCNE2 , but not CCNE1 , was characteristic of the luminal B and HER2 subtypes of breast cancer and was strongly predictive of shorter distant metastasis-free survival following endocrine therapy .	
21445621-10	These data provide the first evidence that hesperidin could be developed as an agent against hematopoietic malignancies .	
22564725-4	However , this regulation was lost in tamoxifen-resistant ( MCF-7 TAMR ) cells , which overexpressed cyclin E2 .	91 9
22564725-5	Expression of either cyclin E1 or E2 in T-47D breast cancer cells conferred acute antiestrogen resistance , suggesting that cyclin E overexpression contributes to the antiestrogen resistance of tamoxifen-resistant cells .	91 9
22564725-6	Ectopic expression of cyclin E1 or E2 also reduced sensitivity to CDK4 , but not CDK2 , inhibition .	91 9
22564725-7	Proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant cells was inhibited by RNAi-mediated knockdown of cyclin E1 , cyclin E2 , or CDK2 .	91 9
22564725-0	Cyclin E2 , but not cyclin E1 , is included in several gene signatures that predict disease progression in either tamoxifen-resistant or metastatic breast cancer .	
22564725-1	We therefore examined the role of cyclin E2 in antiestrogen resistance in vitro and its potential for therapeutic targeting through cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibition .	
20377132-8	However , p38 inhibitor did not change ROS level and GSH content .	
20377132-9	In conclusion , MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells via apoptosis without formation of ROS .	8 81
20377132-6	MEK and JNK inhibitors did not strongly affect cell growth , cell death , ROS , and GSH levels in MG132-treated A549 cells .	
20377132-7	In contrast , p38 inhibitor reduced cell growth inhibition , apoptosis , and MMP ( deltapsi(m) ) loss by MG132 .	921 92 9
20377132-4	ROS were not increased in MG132-treated A549 cells .	
20377132-5	MG132 increased GSH-depleted cell numbers and decreased GSH levels .	
20377132-2	Treatment with 10 microM MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells at 24 h .	
20377132-3	MG132 also induced apoptosis , which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ; deltapsi(m) ) .	8 81
20377132-0	MG132 , as a proteasome inhibitor , can induce apoptotic cell death through formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
20377132-1	In this study , we investigated the effects of MAPK ( MEK , JNK , and p38 ) inhibitors on MG132-treated A549 lung cancer cells in relation to cell growth , cell death , ROS , and glutathione ( GSH ) levels .	
19637241-9	These observations indicate that Nucling is important for the regulation of NF-kappaB signals in liver .	
12419447-11	Treatment of cells with a combination of IMC-C225 + gemcitabine + radiation produced the highest induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in vitro .	8 81
12419447-10	IMC-C225 inhibited EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on both cell lines .	9 93
12419447-13	CONCLUSIONS The IMC-C225 therapy in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy and radiation therapy demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy over the single and double combination therapies .	
12419447-12	Combination treatment with IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation produced 100% complete regression of MiaPaCa-2 tumors for more than 250 days , and the greatest growth inhibition of BxPC-3 tumors compared to any single or dual treatments .	
12419447-14	This form of multimodality treatment shows potential clinical application in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in humans .	
23245831-8	Our data identify a previously unknown role of deoxyribonucleotides in regulation of OIS .	
23082126-4	In this study , we addressed the reverse possibility of a metabolic control of HIF-1 in tumor cells .	
22809334-8	Additionally , double electron electron resonance ( DEER ) spectroscopy was performed on the GB1 double mutant in its monomeric form and yielded a most probable interspin distance of 25 ± 1 Å .	
22809334-9	In order to evaluate the accuracy of the measured DEER distance , the rotamers observed in the crystal structure of the domain-swapped GB1 dimer were modeled into a high-resolution structure of the wild type monomeric GB1 .	
22888341-11	Conclusions .	
22888341-10	In vitro , N-desulfated heparin inhibited significantly bFGF protein and mRNA expression of gastric carcinoma cells ( P < 0.05 ) .	71 7 711
22809334-0	X-ray crystallography has been a useful tool in the development of site-directed spin labeling by resolving rotamers of the nitroxide spin-label side chain in a variety of \u03b1-helical environments .	
22809334-1	In this work , the crystal structure of a doubly spin-labeled N8C/K28C mutant of the B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G ( GB1 ) was solved .	
22809334-2	The double mutant formed a domain-swapped dimer under crystallization conditions .	
22809334-3	Two rotameric states of the spin-label were resolved at the solvent-exposed \u03b1-helical site , at residue 28 ; these are in good agreement with rotamers previously reported for helical structures .	
22809334-4	The second site , at residue 8 on an interior \u03b2-strand , shows the presence of three distinct solvent-exposed side-chain rotamers .	
22809334-5	One of these rotamers is rarely observed within crystal structures of R1 sites and suggests that the H(\u03b1) and S(\u03b4) hydrogen bond that is common to \u03b1-helical sites is absent at this interior \u03b2-strand residue .	
22809334-6	Variable temperature continuous wave ( CW ) experiments of the \u03b2-strand site showed two distinct components that were correlated to the rotameric states observed in crystallography .	
22809334-7	Interestingly , the CW data at room temperature could be fit without the use of an order parameter , which is consistent with the lack of the H(\u03b1) and S(\u03b4) interaction .	
20147338-7	In addition , the accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine , and the decrease of uric acid concentration , suggest that the purine biosynthesis pathway could have been substituted by the salvage pathway in CRC .	
20737228-1	The effect of these essential fatty acids may be related to oxidative stress .	
20737228-2	Therefore , the study was designed to evaluate the effect of different ratios of fish oil ( FO ) and corn oil ( CO ) in the prevention of colon cancer .	
20737228-3	Male Wistar rats were divided into control , dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride ( DMH ) treated , FO + CO ( 1:1 ) and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) .	
20147338-3	The metabolic profiles were obtained using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS .	
20147338-2	Colonic tissues including tumor , polyps and adjacent matched normal mucosa from 26 patients with sporadic CRC from freshly isolated resections were used for this study .	
20737228-6	DMH treatment in the initiation phase animals showed mild to moderate inflammation , decreased ROS and TrxR activity , increased antioxidants , apoptosis and ACF multiplicity .	a21 a2 a 8 81
20147338-0	Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) arises as the consequence of progressive changes from normal epithelial cells through polyp to tumor , and thus is an useful model for studying metabolic shift .	
20737228-8	The FO + CO ( 1:1 ) treated animals showed severe inflammation , a decrease in ROS , an increase in antioxidants and apoptosis in the initiation phase .	a21 a2 a 8 81
20737228-9	FO + CO ( 1:1 ) in the post initiation phase and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) in the initiation showed mild inflammation , increased ROS , apoptosis and decreased antioxidants .	a21 a2 a 8 81
20147338-9	It appears that to gain a growth advantage , cancer cells may adopt alternate metabolic pathways in tumorigenesis and this flexibility allows them to adapt and thrive in harsh environment .	
20147338-8	Further , there was a step-wise reduction of deoxycholic acid concentration from mucosa to tumors .	
22948179-6	In addition , phosphorylations of AKT and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) were increased and decreased by rSHH-N and SHH signaling inhibitor , respectively .	
22883142-3	Here we provide a DNA sequence analysis of the innate immune gene STAT2 and show that a haplotype carried by many Eurasians ( but not sub-Saharan Africans ) has a sequence that closely matches that of the Neanderthal STAT2 .	
20160030-3	These transcription factors , nuclear receptor subfamily 1 , group D , member 1 ( NR1D1 ) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma binding protein ( PBP ) , both reside on ERBB2-containing 17q12-21 amplicons and are part of the ERBB2 expression signature .	
20160030-2	Here we describe an RNA interference-based analysis of these genes that identifies transcriptional regulators of fat synthesis and storage as being critical for the survival of these cells .	
20160030-1	Transcriptional profiling meta-analyses have shown that there are approximately 150 genes co-overexpressed with ERBB2 , suggesting that these genes may represent alternative factors influencing ERBB2-positive tumors .	
20160030-0	Overexpression of the adverse prognostic marker ERBB2 occurs in 30% of breast cancers ; however , therapies targeting this gene have not proved to be as effective as was initially hoped .	
20160030-7	Together , these results show that the cells of this aggressive form of breast cancer are genetically preprogrammed to depend on NR1D1 and PBP for the energy production necessary for survival .	
20160030-6	The resulting high-level fat production from increased expression of these genes likely contributes to an abnormal cellular energy metabolism based on aerobic glycolysis .	31 3
20160030-5	Malate dehydrogenase 1 and malic enzyme 1 , enzymes that link glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis , are also regulated by NR1D1 .	
20160030-4	We show that NR1D1 and PBP act through a common pathway in upregulating several genes in the de novo fatty acid synthesis network , which is highly active in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells .	
23082126-1	Together with anaerobic glycolysis , the Warburg effect , formally corresponding to uncoupling glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation , directly participates in cancer aggressiveness , supporting both tumor progression and dissemination .	
22742931-3	The majority of HCC-related deaths result from local invasion ( to cause liver failure ) or distant metastases .	
22742931-2	HCC is difficult to diagnose at early stage , and has a very poor survival rate when diagnosed at a late stage .	
22742931-1	Major risk factors of HCC include infection with hepatitis B or C viruses , alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .	
22742931-0	Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide .	
22742931-7	PPARγ activation also induces an inhibitory effect on HCC metastasis .	1 12
22742931-6	A substantial body of evidence based on in vitro and in vivo models indicates that the activation of PPARγ is able to inhibit HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the regulation of a panel of downstream effector molecules .	91 8 81 9
22742931-5	As the target of an established class of therapeutic agent thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ ( PPARγ ) has been widely studied for its role in the development of HCC .	
22742931-4	There is an urgent need to identify effective molecular targets for the treatment of the disease .	
22742931-9	In the present review , we summarize the available information on the role of PPARγ in HCC development and spread , and discuss whether PPARγ activation by TZDs could play a role in the treatment of HCC , summarizing both in vitro and in vivo .	
22742931-8	Meanwhile , there is new evidence suggesting that PPARγ inhibition could also be anti-tumorigenic .	
22564725-8	Furthermore , CDK2 inhibition of E-cyclin overexpressing cells and tamoxifen-resistant cells restored sensitivity to tamoxifen or CDK4 inhibition .	91 9
23293472-0	Prostate cancer is responsible for major deaths globally after lung cancer .	
23293472-3	About 30% of all human cancers are caused by tobacco smoking and inhaled pollutants .	
23293472-2	Individual risk and incidence of prostate cancer may result from the interaction of genetic susceptibility with exposure to environmental factors such as infectious agents , tobacco , occupational exposure , dietary carcinogens , and/or hormonal imbalances leading to injury of the prostate and to the development of chronic inflammation .	
20357518-8	In SNB19VR cells , down-regulation of MSH6 message and protein expression may confer temozolomide tolerance .	
20357518-9	Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( a key base excision repair ( BER ) enzyme ) partially restored sensitivity , and DNA repair gene arrays demonstrated up-regulation ( >5-fold ) of BER gene NTL1 in SNB19VR cells .	62 6
23293472-7	Serum IL-18 ( Interleukin-18 ) level was done by ELISA .	
23293472-6	A total of 578 ( n = 284 biopsy proven prostate cancer patients , n = 294 controls with and without tobacco exposed population ) were recruited .	
20357518-4	Variant cell lines ( SNB19VR , U373VR ) were generated that displayed acquired temozolomide resistance ( GI(50) values 280 and 289 microM , respectively ) .	
20357518-5	Cross-resistance to mitozolomide was observed in U373VR cells only .	
20357518-6	In clonogenic and MTT assays , methylguanine methyltransferase ( MGMT ) depletion using O6-benzylguanine sensitized U373VR cells to temozolomide , indicating the resistance mechanism involves MGMT re-expression .	
20357518-7	Indeed , Western blot analyses revealed MGMT protein in cell lysates .	
20357518-0	Treatment for glioblastoma multiforme includes the alkylating agent temozolomide combined with ionizing radiation .	
20357518-1	Persistent O6-guanine methylation by temozolomide in O6-methylguanine methyl transferase negative tumors causes cytotoxic lesions recognized by DNA mismatch repair , triggering apoptosis .	62 6
20357518-2	Resistance ( intrinsic or acquired ) presents obstacles to successful temozolomide treatment , limiting drug efficacy and life expectancy .	
20357518-3	Two glioma cell lines , SNB19 and U373 , sensitive to temozolomide ( GI(50) values 36 and 68 microM , respectively ) were exposed to increasing temozolomide concentrations ( 1-100 microM ) .	
22564725-9	Cyclin E2 overexpression is therefore a potential mechanism of resistance to both endocrine therapy and CDK4 inhibition .	91 9
23513490-8	Treatment for these tumors is often multimodal and includes surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone replacement .	
22797064-2	In this work , we found that PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MMSET compared with immortalized , non-transformed prostate cells .	
22797064-3	Knockdown experiments showed that , in metastatic PCa cell lines , dimethylation of lysine 36 and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 ( H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 , respectively ) depended on MMSET expression , whereas depletion of MMSET in benign prostatic cells did not affect chromatin modifications .	
23513490-0	Metastases in the sellar region are rare and are frequently found incidentally or in necropsies .	
23513490-1	Only 7% are reported to be symptomatic .	
23513490-2	Diabetes insipidus , anterior pituitary dysfunction , visual field defects , headache/pain and ophthalmoplegia are the most commonly reported symptoms .	
23513490-3	We present the cases of two male patients with a small-cell lung carcinoma whose first clinical symptoms were due to pituitary metastasis .	1 12
12507933-11	In conclusion , sulindac exerted its chemopreventive effect against the formation of EAC in the rat EGDA model possibly through its inhibition of Cox .	
12507933-10	Inhibition of tumor formation by sulindac was correlated with lowered levels of PGE2 .	
23513490-6	Pituitary metastases occur most commonly with breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men .	1 12
22027089-12	Cell death in response to TPEN ( but not ZP ) was diminished by a calpain inhibitor and largely prevented by a caspase 3 inhibitor .	
20333571-5	Mediastinal lymph node involvement , tumor size , incomplete resection , pneumonectomy , presence of necrosis and perineural invasion were significant prognosticators ( P = 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.0001 , 0.046 , 0.0246 , < 0.0001 , respectively ) .	11 83 1 8
20333571-4	RESULTS Overall 5-year survival was 42.2 % .	11 83 1 8
20333571-7	Patients who had stage I tumor with necrosis and perineural invasion had a lower survival rate than those with stage IIIA tumor without these histopathological features ( P = 0.04 ) .	11 83 1 8
20333571-6	Multivariate analysis revealed that N status , perineural invasion , and the presence of necrosis were independent prognostic factors ( P = 0.006 , P = 0.001 , P = 0.001 , respectively ) .	11 83 1 8
20333571-1	In this work , intratumoral perineural invasion , lymphatic and blood vessel invasion together with the necrosis content of the tumor exclusive of the non-small cell cancer staging system were studied .	
20333571-0	BACKGROUND The current staging system provides an anatomical classification of lung tumors ; its secondary purpose is to allow the prognostic stratification of patients into homogeneous groups after surgery .	
20333571-3	Mean age of patients was 55.7 +/- 10.1 years .	
20333571-2	METHODS During a 4-year period , 152 patients operated for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) at our hospital were analyzed .	
21179939-0	Carbon nanotubes have a wide range of applications in various industries and their use is likely to rise in the future .	
1403541-14	Thus , either variable ( but not both ) of each pair added information to the multivariate model .	
21179939-2	Long ( > 15 microm ) straight nanotubes may undergo frustrated phagocytosis which is likely to result in reduced clearance .	
21179939-3	We examine here the effects of multiwalled carbon nanotubes of different sizes on monocytic THP-1 cells , with regard to their ability to stimulate increased expression of the HO-1 and GST genes and their ability to produce nuclear translocation of the transcription factor , Nrf2 , as well as the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators of inflammation .	
20333571-9	CONCLUSIONS Perineural invasion and the presence of necrosis independently indicated a dismal prognosis and their prognostic power is comparable to those of the TNM classification .	11 83 1 8
20333571-8	The presence of these histopathological characteristics in stage IIIA patients was a sign of a poorer prognosis ( P = 0.0001 ) .	11 83 1 8
21179939-6	The long nanotubes ( NT1 ) caused increased release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta , an effect which was diminished by the antioxidant trolox , suggesting a role of oxidative stress in the upregulation of this cytokine .	a21 a2 a
21179939-7	Tentatively , our study suggests that long carbon nanotubes may exert their effect in THP-1 cells in part via an oxidative stress mechanism .	a21 a2 a
19909581-7	This is especially interesting since the dipeptide is a naturally occurring substance that should be well tolerated .	
19909581-6	DISCUSSION Carnosine might be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of malignant glioma or other tumors since it inhibits the glycolytic energy metabolism that is crucial for cancer cells and malignant gliomas as shown in the current study .	31 3
19909581-5	In addition , ATP production by mitochondrial activity did not significantly contribute to ATP production and carnosine was identified to be an inhibitor of the vital anaerobic glycolysis .	31 3
19909581-4	RESULTS The experiments identified glycolysis as crucial for ATP production in gliomas .	31 3
19909581-3	As a specific inhibitor for anaerobic glycolysis , oxamate , and as an inhibitor for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , potassium cyanide , were used , and the influence on ATP production was determined using cell-based assays .	
19909581-2	METHODS Cells from the glioma line T98G and primary cultured cells from human malignant glioma were cultivated in the presence of carnosine and inhibitors of cellular energy metabolism .	
19909581-1	In order to understand how this effect is mediated , experiments were performed that addressed a possible influence of carnosine on energy metabolism .	
19909581-0	OBJECTIVES Recently , it was revealed that carnosine inhibits growth of cells isolated from human malignant glioma .	
23219753-5	The overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rates were significantly correlated with strong expression of Rap-1A ( P < 0.001 ) .	
23219753-4	Strong Rap-1A expression was a significant prognostic marker and predictor of aggressive OCSCC .	
1403541-15	In patients resected for cure , positive nodes or high histological grade became the only significant predictors of survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )	
23245831-1	Oxidative stress and hyperreplication of genomic DNA have been proposed as major causes of DNA damage in OIS cells .	
23219753-3	To determine the possible correlation between Rap-1A expression and various clinical characteristics , 256 samples from patients with OCSCC were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining .	
22797064-8	Depletion of TWIST1 in MMSET-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells blocked cell invasion and EMT , indicating that TWIST1 was a critical target of MMSET , responsible for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype .	11 1
23219753-2	Semiquantitative RT-PCR , quantitative RT-PCR , and Western blotting were used to evaluate Rap-1A mRNA and protein expressions , respectively , in paired OCSCC patient specimens .	
22797064-9	Collectively , these data suggest that MMSET has a role in PCa pathogenesis and progression through epigenetic regulation of metastasis-related genes .	1 12
23219753-1	In this study , we examined the expression of Rap-1A at different malignant stages of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma ( OCSCC ) .	
19637241-6	In addition , we observed a decrease in the number of Kupffer cells ( KCs ) in the KO mice .	
12231192-10	Thus , a high dermal mast cell prevalence as demonstrable in buttock skin is a significant predisposing factor for development of BCC in humans .	
23219753-0	The functions of Rap-1A in oral carcinogenesis are largely unexplored .	
23245831-0	In normal human cells , oncogene-induced senescence ( OIS ) depends on induction of DNA damage response .	
23267699-1	YM155 , a novel molecular targeted agent , suppresses survivin , which is overexpressed in many tumor types .	
23267699-0	ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Survivin , a member of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins , functions as a key regulator of mitosis and programmed cell death .	
23267699-3	METHODS : SK-NEP-1 cell growth in vitro and in vivo was assessed by MTT and nude mice experiments .	
23267699-2	The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor activity of YM155 in SK-NEP-1 cells .	
23267699-5	Then gene expression profile of tumor cells treated with YM155 was analyzed with real-time PCR arrays .	
23267699-4	Annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis was used to detect apoptosis in cell culture .	
23267699-7	Datasets representing genes with altered expression profile derived from cluster analyses were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool .	
23267699-6	We then analyzed the expression data with MEV ( Multi Experiment View ) cluster software .	
23267699-9	Annexin V assay , cell cycle , and activation of caspase-3 demonstrates that YM155 induced apoptosis in SK-NEP-1 cells .	8 81
23267699-8	RESULTS : YM155 treatment resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells in a dose-dependent manner .	
23266736-3	However , sesamin synergistic enhancement of γ-tocotrienol-induced anticancer effects was not found to be mediated from a reduction in γ-tocotrienol metabolism .	
12658828-1	PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with colo-rectal carcinoma were included in a prospective trial and treated by laparoscopic resection .	
12658828-0	OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to analyse the results and long term outcome in a prospective non randomised trial of 74 patients treated by laparoscopic colo-rectal resection for cancer , and to determine wether survival and recurrence are or are not compromised by an initial laparoscopic approach .	
12658828-3	A median of 5 years follow up was available .	
12658828-2	All patients were reviewed at 1 , 3 , and 6 months interval .	
12658828-5	RESULTS Six conversions ( 8.1% ) were necessary : 2 for tumor invasion of adjacent organs , 2 for limited margin resection in lower rectal tumors , 1 for small bowel injury and 1 for obesity .	11 1
12658828-4	Forty-eight patients ( 65% ) had more than 3 years of follow up .	
12658828-7	Mean postoperative stay was 8.2 +/- 3.4 days .	
12658828-6	After surgery , passing flatus occurred at 34.3 +/- 16.7 h and oral intake could be reinstaured at 42.6 +/- 22 h .	
12658828-9	The overall morbidity was about 13.5% .	
12658828-8	No death occurred .	
23245831-2	Here , we report that down-regulation of deoxyribonucleoside pools is another endogenous source of DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts ( NHFs ) undergoing HRAS(G12V)-induced senescence .	61 42 4 6
23180966-6	The mean survival time was 32.2 ± 1.9 months ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] : 28.5-35.8 months ; median 30.0 months ) ; 1- , 2- and 3-year survival rates were 86.5% ± 3.5% , 57.3% ± 5.1% , and 37.1% ± 5.4% , respectively .	
22653530-5	In particular , observed effect of cell division gives perspectives for future selective cancer treatment with NPs .	
22653530-4	This may very likely concern other types of NPs able to reach the cell nuclei .	
22653530-3	In addition , we show that cell division plays key-role in penetration of silicon carbide based NPs ( SiC NPs ) inside the cell nucleus .	
22653530-2	For the first time , this work demonstrates strong influence of cell active proliferation/contact inhibition of proliferation on uptake of NPs .	5 52
22653530-1	Nevertheless , all previous investigations in this area were done on proliferating cells .	
22653530-0	Semiconductor nanoparticles ( NPs ) became important and wide-used tool for cell imaging because of their unique remarkable properties .	
23245831-5	Importantly , ectopic coexpression of TS and RR or addition of deoxyribonucleosides substantially suppressed DNA damage , senescence-associated phenotypes , and proliferation arrest in two types of NHF-expressing HRAS(G12V) .	61 42 4 6
23180966-5	RESULTS Sixty-three patients ( 65.2% ) died during the follow-up period .	
23180966-2	METHODS Ninety-six paraffin-embedded specimens of non-small cell lung cancer patients were examined .	
23269235-2	Although autophagy is a highly regulated cellular process , its relevance to cancer seems to be complicated .	
23180966-3	All patients underwent radical thoracic surgery of primary tumor ( lobectomy or pneumonectomy ) and regional lymph node dissection. \u03b3-H2AX expression was assessed by standard immunohistochemistry .	
23026134-4	In vitro experiments revealed that the addition of a neutralizing anti-ICOS antibody blocked pDC-induced Treg expansion and interleukin-10 secretion by memory CD4(+) T cells , establishing a pivotal role for ICOS in this process .	2 21
23026134-5	Supporting these findings , the presence of ICOS(+) cells in clinical specimens of breast cancer correlated with a poor prognosis .	
23026134-6	Together , our results highlight an important relationship between Treg and pDC in breast tumors , and show that ICOS/ICOS-L interaction is a central event in immunosuppression of tumor-associated memory CD4(+) T cells .	2 22
23026134-7	These findings strongly rationalize antibody-mediated ICOS blockade as a powerful clinical strategy to correct immune escape and promote therapeutic responses in breast cancer .	
23026134-0	Human breast tumors are infiltrated by memory CD4(+) T cells along with increased numbers of regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) that facilitate immune escape and correlate with poor prognosis .	
23026134-1	Here , we report that inducible costimulatory molecule ( ICOS ) , a T cell costimulatory molecule of the CTLA4/PD1/CD28 family , is expressed mostly by tumor-associated Treg in primary breast tumors .	
23026134-2	A large proportion of these ICOS(+) Treg were Ki67(+) and this evident proliferative expansion was found to rely on interactions with tumor-associated pDC .	
23026134-3	Indeed , tumor-associated Treg highly expanded in presence of pDC but failed to proliferate under CD3/CD28 signal .

23245831-4	Chromatin at the promoters of the genes encoding TS and RR was enriched with retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 9 .	
22498909-0	Estrogens , acting through estrogen receptor α ( ERα ) , stimulate breast cancer proliferation , making ERα an attractive drug target .	
19637241-7	KCs are important for the hepatic immune system , acting as phagocytes or antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) .	2 21
1617649-2	Because of their structural similarity to N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , we carried out studies to determine whether amitriptyline and fluoxetine stimulate tumor growth and/or development in rodents at concentrations relevant to the treatment of human depression ( equivalent human dose range , approximately 100-150 mg/day for amitriptyline and approximately 20-80 mg/day for fluoxetine ) .	
1617649-3	All experiments were performed blinded .	
1617649-0	Tricyclic antidepressants , such as amitriptyline ( Elavil ) , and the nontricyclic agent , fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , bind to growth-regulatory intracellular histamine receptors , associated with anti-estrogen binding sites in microsomes and nuclei .	
1617649-1	The prototype anti-estrogen binding site/intracellular histamine receptor ligand , N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , inhibits normal cell proliferation in vitro but stimulates tumor growth in vivo .	
1617649-6	In a mammary carcinogenesis model , the effects of chronic saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine administration on the rate and frequency of development of mammary tumors in rats fed dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA ) were compared .	
1617649-7	Eight of 20 amitriptyline- or fluoxetine-treated mice developed fibrosarcoma tumors by day 5 , as compared to none of 20 saline controls ( P less than 0.002 ) .	
1617649-4	In studies of growth stimulation of transplantable syngeneic tumors , groups of mice were inoculated s.c. with C-3 fibrosarcoma cells or given i.v. or s.c. injections of B16f10 melanoma cells , followed 24 h later by daily i.p. injections of saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine .	
1617649-5	Tumor latency ( fibrosarcoma ) , aggregate tumor weight ( s.c. injected melanoma ) , or time to death from pulmonary metastasis ( i.v. injected melanoma ) was determined ; drug-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis in C-3 fibrosarcoma cells in vitro was correlated with tumor growth acceleration in vivo .	9
1617649-8	Similarly , 20 of 21 DMBA-treated rats receiving the antidepressant drugs developed 33 mammary tumors by week 15 as compared to 5 tumors in 4 of 7 DMBA-treated rats receiving saline ( P less than 0.001 ) .	
1617649-9	For both models , tumor latency decreased 30-40% and , in the DMBA model , tumor frequency increased greater than 2-fold in the antidepressant-treated rats as compared to controls .	
23245831-7	However , overexpression of TS and RR in quiescent NHFs did not overcome proliferation arrest , suggesting that unlike quiescence , OIS requires depletion of dNTP pools and activated DNA replication .	
24139416-0	Metastasis is the most lethal attribute of human malignancy .	
22498909-1	Since 384-well format screens for inhibitors of proliferation can be challenging for some cells , inhibition of luciferase-based reporters is often used as a surrogate end point .	
23180966-7	Low \u03b3-H2AX expression was associated with a significantly better survival as compared with those having high \u03b3-H2AX expression ( 35.3 months for low \u03b3-H2AX expression versus 23.2 months for high \u03b3-H2AX expression , P = 0.009 ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.95 , 95% CI : 1.15-3.30 ) .	612 61 6
23180966-4	Follow-up was available for all patients ; mean duration of follow-up was 27.50 ± 14.07 months ( range 0.2-57 months , median 24 months ) .	
22498909-3	Seventy-five " hits " were evaluated in tiered follow-up assays to identify where hits failed to progress and evaluate their effectiveness as inhibitors of E(2)-ERα-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells .	
20980434-9	In summary , our findings offer a proof of concept for targeting OPN and its downstream p38 signaling as a novel therapeutic strategy to manage cervical cancer .	
20980434-8	Analysis of clinical specimens revealed that enhanced expression of OPN , phosphorylated NF-κB , p65 , and furin correlated with cervical cancer progression , further strengthening the in vitro and in vivo results .	
23180966-0	BACKGROUND Phosphorylation of the H2AX histone is an early indicator of DNA double-strand breaks and of the resulting DNA damage response .	
23180966-1	In the present study , we assessed the expression and prognostic significance of \u03b3-H2AX in a cohort of 96 patients with operable non-small cell lung carcinoma .	
20980434-5	OPN-induced furin expression and cell motility was impeded by blockades to MKK3/6 , p38α/β or NF-κB signaling .	
20980434-4	OPN induces CD44-mediated MKK3/6 phosphorylation which in turn phosphorylates p38 in these cells .	
20980434-7	Furin overexpression similarly augmented tumor growth in the model , whereas blocking MKK3/6 , p38 , or furin reduced OPN-induced cervical tumor growth .	
20980434-6	In a mouse xenograft model of human cervical cancer , tumor growth was enhanced by OPN overexpression and blocked by short hairpin RNA ( shRNA)-mediated OPN silencing .	
20980434-1	Enhanced levels of activated p38 isoforms have been linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer , although the mechanistic basis for this association is poorly understood .	
20980434-0	p38 kinases activated by growth factors , hormones , and environmental stresses exert diverse functions in regulating normal and malignant cell pathophysiology .	
20980434-3	OPN regulates CD44-mediated p38 phosphorylation that induces NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent expression of furin , an extracellular protease implicated in human papilloma virus ( HPV ) processing that enhances cervical cancer cell motility .	921 92 9
20980434-2	In this study , we report that p38 activation in cervical cancer cells is driven by osteopontin ( OPN ) , an extracellular matrix-associated cytokine that drives invasive progression .	921 92 9
