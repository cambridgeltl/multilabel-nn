11385637-0	BACKGROUND We conducted a population-based case-control study in Montreal , Canada , to explore associations between hundreds of occupational circumstances and several cancer sites , including colon .	
11385637-1	METHODS We interviewed 497 male patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of colon cancer , 1514 controls with cancers at other sites , and 533 population-based controls .	
11385637-2	Detailed job histories and relevant potential confounding variables were obtained , and the job histories were translated by a team of chemists and industrial hygienists into a history of occupational exposures .	2 21
11385637-3	RESULTS We found that there was reasonable evidence of associations for men employed in nine industry groups ( adjusted odds ranging from 1.1 to 1.6 per a 10-year increase in duration of employment ) , and in 12 job groups ( OR varying from 1.1 to 1.7 ) .	
11385637-4	In addition , we found evidence of increased risks by increasing level of exposures to 21 occupational agents , including polystyrene ( OR for " substantial " exposure ( OR(subst) ) = 10.7 ) , polyurethanes ( OR(subst) = 8.4 ) , coke dust ( OR(subst) = 5.6 ) , mineral oils ( OR(subst) = 3.3 ) , polyacrylates ( OR(subst) = 2.8 ) , cellulose nitrate ( OR(subst) = 2.6 ) , alkyds ( OR(subst) = 2.5 ) , inorganic insulation dust ( OR(subst) = 2.3 ) , plastic dusts ( OR(subst) = 2.3 ) , asbestos ( OR(subst) = 2.1 ) , mineral wool fibers ( OR(subst) = 2.1 ) , glass fibers ( OR(subst) = 2.0 ) , iron oxides ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , aliphatic ketones ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , benzene ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , xylene ( OR(subst) = 1.9 ) , inorganic acid solutions ( OR(subst) = 1.8 ) , waxes , polishes ( OR(subst) = 1.8 ) , mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons ( OR(subst) = 1.6 ) , toluene ( OR(subst) = 1.6 ) , and diesel engine emissions ( OR(subst) = 1.5 ) .	
11385637-5	Not all of these effects are independent because some exposures occurred contemporaneously with others or because they referred to a group of substances .	
11385637-6	CONCLUSIONS We have uncovered a number of occupational associations with colon cancer .	
11385637-7	For most of these agents , there are no published data to support or refute our observations .	
11385637-8	As there are few accepted risk factors for colon cancer , we suggest that new occupational and toxicologic studies be undertaken focusing on the more prevalent substances reported herein .	
23528250-0	Dioxins are metabolized by cytochrome P450 , family 1 ( CYP1 ) via the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) .	
23528250-1	We determined whether different blood dioxin concentrations are associated with polymorphisms in AHR ( dbSNP ID : rs2066853 ) , AHR repressor ( AHRR ; rs2292596 ) , CYP1 subfamily A polypeptide 1 ( CYP1A1 ; rs4646903 and rs1048963 ) , CYP1 subfamily A polypeptide 2 ( CYP1A2 ; rs762551 ) , and CYP1 subfamily B polypeptide 1 ( CYP1B1 ; rs1056836 ) in pregnant Japanese women .	1 122 12
23528250-2	These six polymorphisms were detected in 421 healthy pregnant Japanese women .	1 122 12
23528250-3	Differences in dioxin exposure concentrations in maternal blood among the genotypes were investigated .	1 122 12
23528250-4	Comparisons among the GG , GA , and AA genotypes of AHR showed a significant difference ( genotype model : P=0.016 for the mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations and toxicity equivalence quantities [ TEQs] ) .	
23528250-5	Second , we found a significant association with the dominant genotype model ( [ TT+TC ] vs. CC : P=0.048 for the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin TEQs ; P=0.035 for polychlorinated dibenzofuran TEQs ) of CYP1A1 ( rs4646903 ) .	
23528250-6	No significant differences were found among blood dioxin concentrations and polymorphisms in AHRR , CYP1A1 ( rs1048963 ) , CYP1A2 , and CYP1B1 .	
23528250-7	Thus , polymorphisms in AHR and CYP1A1 ( rs4646903 ) were associated with maternal dioxin concentrations .	
23528250-8	However , differences in blood dioxin concentrations were relatively low .	
17367859-0	To explore human biomonitor of persistent organic pollutants ( POP ) for public health risk assessment , extractable organohalogens ( EOX ) , extractable persistent organohalogens ( EPOX ) and some selected organochlorine pesticides ( OCP ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) in children hair from urban and rural regions of Beijing , China , were measured by instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA ) and gas chromatography-electron capture detector ( GC-ECD ) .	1 12 123
17367859-1	The results indicated that about 96% of the total halogens existed as water-soluble polar compounds ; about 25 to 50% of EOX were sulfuric acid-resistant EPOX ; organochlorines were the major fraction of the organohalogens ; and 88 to 99.6% of extractable persistent organochlorines ( EPOCl ) cannot be attributed to the selected OCP and PCB .	
17367859-2	HCH , DDT and 2-5CB were the major contributors to hair OCP and PCB .	
17367859-3	Further , gamma-HCH , p,p'-DDE , p,p'-DDT and PCB-52 were the predominant individuals of HCH , DDT and 2-5CB , respectively .	
17367859-4	The concentration distributions of EPOCl , HCH , DDT and PCB in children hair were generally in the order of urban&gt;rural and girls&gt;boys , except for PCB congeners with random distributions between genders .	1 123 12
17367859-5	Pearson positive correlations between hair lipid and the detected parameters of hair gamma-HCH ( p&lt;0.01 ) , DDT ( p&lt;0.01 ) , EOCl ( p&lt;0.05 ) , as well as EPOCl ( p&lt;0.05 ) were observed .	
17367859-6	Also , the ratios of hair alpha/gamma and p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT suggested that fresh input of HCH and DDT might exist in Beijing area .	
17367859-7	Hair can reflect body's integral exposure to POP from endogenous and exogenous sources , which , thus , can be used as a potential biomonitor in assessing POP exposure for public health purposes .	1 123 12
11386745-0	The most frequently used pesticide in U.S. homes , as well as in schools and day care centers , is chlorpyrifos .	
11386745-1	In 1998 , this insecticide was detected in household dust from the former U.S. Forces housing estates in Frankfurt am Main , Germany , resulting from its earlier use up to 1993 , i.e. , at least 4 years ago .	
11386745-2	This led to great concern in the new inhabitants .	
11386745-3	To investigate their internal exposure to the substance , they were offered the opportunity of taking part in biomonitoring examinations .	
11386745-4	Children playing on the floor were assumed to be especially at risk due to increased exposure to chlorpyrifos via oral or dermal intake .	
11386745-5	A total of 1146 inhabitants took part in this voluntary investigation .	
11386745-6	All of them stated that they had never used chlorpyrifos in their homes .	
11386745-7	Spot urine samples of the study participants were analyzed for six metabolites of organophosphorous insecticides [ dimethylphosphate ( DMP ) , diethylphosphate ( DEP ) , dimethylthiophosphate ( DMTP ) , diethylthiophosphate ( DETP ) , dimethyldithiophosphate ( DMDTP ) , and diethyldithiophosphate ( DEDTP) ] using a very sensitive gas chromatographic method with mass-selective detection and a limit of detection of 1 microg/L .	1 12 127
11386745-8	No evidence was found of increased internal exposure due to former chlorpyrifos application in these homes ( &gt;4 years ago ) , either in children or in adults .	
11386745-9	The median values and 95th percentiles of the urinary metabolite concentrations in 484 adults were ( microg/g creatinine ) : DMP , 15.5 and 102.5 ; DMTP , 13.5 and 125.8 ; DMDTP , &lt;1 and 13.1 ; DEP , 2.1 and 11.6 ; DETP , &lt;1 and 6.4 ; DEDTP , both &lt;1 .	1 12 127
11386745-10	The urinary metabolite concentrations in children &lt;6 years of age were higher ; this was caused mainly by lower creatinine concentrations .	1 12 127
11386745-11	To conclude , no increase in internal exposure due to former indoor application of chlorpyrifos could be found , and the reference values published for internal organophosphate exposure in adults in Germany were confirmed .	
11386745-12	However , as shown in other environmental studies , the urinary excretion of organophosphorous metabolites exceeds dietary intake several fold ; this has been estimated from the data in various duplicate dietary studies .	
11386745-13	This observation calls for further investigation .	
22791021-0	This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate blood mercury ( B-Hg ) concentration of residents living in the vicinity of Chatian mercury mine ( CMM ) in southwestern China and to assess the possible effects on renal function .	1 122 12
22791021-1	It evaluates the effects of gender and age ( children , &lt;18 years ; adults , 18-60 years ; elderly , &gt;60 years ) on the B-Hg and serum creatinine ( SCR ) and serum urea nitrogen ( SUN ) levels .	11 12 11122 1 122 1112 111
22791021-2	In the CMM , elevated levels were found for B-Hg , SCR , and SUN with mean values at 6.09 Î¼g/L , 74.21 Î¼mol/L , and 13.26 mmol/L , which were significantly higher than those in the control area , respectively .	
22791021-3	Moreover , the coefficients between paired results for B-Hg and SCR and SUN levels were positive at statistical significance ( B-Hg vs. SCR , r = 0.45 , p &lt ; 0.01 ; B-Hg vs. SUN , r = 0.20 , p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
22791021-4	The aforementioned results revealed that mercury exposure can cause human renal function impairment .	
22791021-5	B-Hg , SCR , and SUN can also be useful biomarkers to assess the extent of mercury exposure among residents in areas with extensive mining activities .	
22791021-6	Furthermore , data analysis revealed that there was a tendency for higher B-Hg , SCR , and SUN levels in females than in males , and the levels of B-Hg , SCR , and SUN increased among the older residents .	
22791021-7	We conclude that females and the elderly in the mining area were more susceptible to mercury exposure , and therefore , they deserve further research .	
17366830-0	BACKGROUND Hormonally active environmental agents have been measured among U.S. children using exposure biomarkers in urine .	
17366830-1	However , little is known about their variation by race , age , sex , and geography , and no data exist for newly developed biomarkers .	
17366830-2	OBJECTIVE Our goal was to characterize relevant , prevalent exposures for a study of female pubertal development .	
17366830-3	METHODS In a pilot study among 90 girls from New York City , New York , Cincinnati , Ohio , and northern California , we measured 25 urinary analytes representing 22 separate agents from three chemical families : phytoestrogens , phthalates , and phenols .	1 12 127
17366830-4	Exposures occur chiefly from the diet and from household or personal care products .	
17366830-5	RESULTS Participants represented four racial/ethnic groups ( Asian , black , Hispanic , white ) , with mean age of 7.77 years .	
17366830-6	Most analytes were detectable in &gt ; 94% of samples .	
17366830-7	The highest median concentrations for individual analytes in each family were for enterolactone ( 298 microg/L ) , monoethylphthalate ( MEP ; 83.2 microg/L ) , and benzophenone-3 ( BP3 ; 14.7 microg/L ) .	
17366830-8	Few or no data have been reported previously for four metabolites : mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate , tridosan , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , and BP3 ; these were detected in 67-100% of samples with medians of 1.8-53.2 microg/L .	
17366830-9	After multivariate adjustment , two analytes , enterolactone and BPA , were higher among girls with body mass index &lt ; 85th reference percentile than those at or above the 85th percentile .	
17366830-10	Three phthalate metabolites differed by race/ethnicity [ MEP , mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate , and mono-3-carboxypropylphthalate ] .	
17366830-11	CONCLUSIONS A wide spectrum of hormonally active exposure biomarkers were detectable and variable among young girls , with high maximal concentrations ( &gt ; 1,000 microg/L ) found for several analytes .	1 12 127
17366830-12	They varied by characteristics that may be relevant to development .	
22805989-0	The developing fetus is particularly vulnerable to adverse effects from pharmaceutical and exogenous chemical exposure .	
22805989-1	Deciduous teeth primarily form over specific periods from the second trimester in utero through the months after birth .	
22805989-2	We hypothesized that organic chemicals or their metabolites circulating in the bloodstream may sorb into forming dental tissues and remain stored in the tooth thereafter .	
22805989-3	Our aims were to devise analytical and preparation methods for potentially toxic or beneficial organic chemicals or metabolites in deciduous teeth and to estimate their detection frequencies .	1 12 125
22805989-4	The analgesic acetaminophen was stored at greater concentration in a child's second molar than a first molar , consistent with intake , suggesting that acetaminophen concentration in molars may be a biomarker of acetaminophen exposure during molar formation .	1 12
22805989-5	Chemicals detected by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in molars of 21 typically developing children include the endocannabinoid anandamide ( 86% of children ) , acetaminophen ( 43% ) , and specific metabolites mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP , of plasticizer di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate , 29% ) , 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPy , of organophosphate ( OP ) insecticide chlorpyrifos , 10% ) , and 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol ( IMPy , of OP insecticide diazinon , 10% ) .	
22805989-6	None of these chemicals has previously been detected in human teeth .	1 12 125
22805989-7	Molars from the two oldest subjects contained the largest concentrations of MEHP , TCPy , and IMPy .	
22805989-8	Potentially protective fatty acids detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after derivatization include docosahexaenoic ( 19% ) , arachidonic ( 100% ) , and linoleic ( 100% ) .	
22805989-9	Validation studies are necessary to verify that each detected chemical in molars provides a biomarker of perinatal exposure .	
11419593-0	The object of this study was to investigate the immune system of 19 women with a mean age of 35 years , for at least 2 years ( mean = 13 years ) exposed to electromagnetic fields ( ELMFs ) induced by radiotelevision broadcasting stations in their residential area .	
11419593-1	In September 1999 , the ELMFs ( with range 500 KHz-3 GHz ) in the balconies of the homes of the women were ( mean +/- S.D. ) 4.3 +/- 1.4 V/m .	
11419593-2	Forty-seven women of similar age , smoking habits and atopy composed the control group , with a nearby resident ELMF exposure of &lt ; 1.8 V/m .	
11419593-3	Blood lead and urinary trans-trans muconic acid ( a metabolite of benzene ) , markers of exposure to urban traffic , were higher in the control women .	1 122 12 127
11419593-4	The ELMF exposed group showed a statistically significant reduction of blood NK CD16+-CD56+ , cytotoxic CD3(-)-CD8+ , B and NK activated CD3(-)-HLA-DR+ and CD3(-)-CD25+ lymphocytes .	1 11 1113 111
11419593-5	' In vitro ' production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma ( INF-gamma ) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) of the ELMF exposed group , incubated either with or without phytohaemoagglutinin ( PHA ) , was significantly lower ; the ' in vitro ' production of IL-2 was significantly correlated with blood CD16+-CD56+ lymphocytes .	11 1 11123 111 1112
11419593-6	The stimulation index ( S.I. ) of blastogenesis ( ratio between cell proliferation with and without PHA ) of PBMC of ELMF exposed women was lower than that of the control subjects .	
11419593-7	The S.I. of blastogenesis of the ELMF exposed group ( but not blood NK lymphocytes and the ' in vitro ' production of IL-2 and INF-gamma by PBMC ) was significantly correlated with the ELMF levels .	
11419593-8	Blood lead and urinary trans-trans muconic acid were barely correlated with immune parameters : the urinary metabolite of benzene of the control group was only correlated with CD16+-CD56+ cells indicating a slight effect of traffic on the immune system .	1 12 127
11419593-9	In conclusion , this study demonstrates that high frequency ELMFs reduce cytotoxic activity in the peripheral blood of women without a dose-response effect .	
23452180-0	East Chicago , Indiana is a heavily industrialized community bisected by the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal , which volatilizes kg/yr polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .	
23452180-1	In contrast , the rural Columbus Junction , Iowa area has no known current or past PCB industrial sources .	
23452180-2	Blood from children and their mothers from these communities were collected April 2008 to January 2009 ( n = 177 ) .	1 122 12
23452180-3	Sera were analyzed for all 209 PCBs and 4 hydroxylated PCBs ( OH-PCBs ) .	1 122 12
23452180-4	Sum PCBs ranged from nondetect to 658 ng/g lw ( median = 33.5 ng/g lw ) .	
23452180-5	Sum OH-PCBs ranged from nondetect to 1.2 ng/g fw ( median = 0.07 ng/g fw ) .	
23452180-6	These concentrations are similar to those reported in other populations without high dietary PCB intake .	
23452180-7	Differences between the two communities were subtle .	
23452180-8	PCBs were detected in more East Chicago mothers and children than Columbus Junction mothers and children , and children from East Chicago were enriched in lower-molecular weight PCBs .	
23452180-9	East Chicago and Columbus Junction residents had similar levels of total and individual PCBs and OH-PCBs in their blood .	
23452180-10	Concentrations of parent PCBs correlated with concentrations of OH-PCBs .	
23452180-11	This is the first temporally and methodologically consistent study to evaluate all 209 PCBs and major metabolites in two generations of people living in urban and rural areas of the United States .	
22933105-0	Considering the human health risk due to the consumption of foodstuffs , the concentrations of heavy metals ( lead , manganese , chromium , cadmium , and arsenic ) are investigated in vegetables , fruits , and fish species collected from the central market ( called Shaheb Bazar ) of Rajshahi City , Bangladesh .	
22933105-1	The foodstuffs examined for metal constituents are the basis of human nutrition in the study area .	
22933105-2	The highest concentrations of Mn and As in vegetables ( onion and pointed gourd , respectively ) , Cr and Cd in fruits ( black berry and mango , respectively ) , and Pb in fish ( catla ) are recorded .	
22933105-3	Health risks associated with these heavy metals are evaluated due to dietary intake .	24 2 243
22933105-4	Target hazard quotient ( THQ ) and hazard index ( HI ) are calculated to evaluate the non-carcinogenic health risk from individual and combined heavy metals .	
22933105-5	The THQ values for individual heavy metals are below 1 , suggesting that people would not experience significant health risks if they ingest a single heavy metal from one kind of foodstuff ( e.g. , vegetables ) .	
22933105-6	However , consumption of several of the foodstuffs could lead a potential health risk to human population since HI value is higher than 1 .	
22933105-7	The relative contributions of vegetables , fishes , and fruits to HI are 49.44 , 39.07 , and 11.53 % , respectively .	
22933105-8	Also , the relative contributions of Pb , Cd , As , Mn , and Cr to HI are 51.81 , 35.55 , 11.73 , 0.85 , and 0.02 % , respectively .	
22933105-9	The estimation shows that the carcinogenic risk of arsenic exceeds the accepted risk level of 1 Ã 10(-6) .	
22933105-10	Thus , the carcinogenic risk of arsenic for consumers is a matter of concern .	
23435065-0	Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) are persistent , bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals .	
23435065-1	These compounds are transferred to breast milk , therefore breastfed infants are at risk of being exposed to considerable amounts of PCBs and PCDD/Fs during this sensitive age .	
23435065-2	In the present study individual breast milk samples were collected at three time points ( days 5 , 12 and 84 postpartum ) from 22 mothers who delivered their infants during 2007 in Baranya County , Hungary .	1 12 124
23435065-3	Breast milk samples were analyzed for 17 PCDD/Fs , 12 dioxin-like ( DL ) PCBs and 7 non-dioxin-like ( NDL ) PCBs using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry .	1 12 124
23435065-4	Each infant's daily breast milk consumptions have been measured biweekly over three months .	24 2 243
23435065-5	The concentration of several PCB and PCDD congeners in breast milk decreased significantly during lactation , with a main decline between days 5 and 12 .	
23435065-6	The total toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) concentrations , derived from PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs , were 3.17Â±1.72 , 2.70Â±1.57 and 2.41Â±1.47 pg TEQ/g fat at the three time points , respectively .	
23435065-7	The corresponding NDL-PCB concentrations were 33.5Â±29.2 , 27.4Â±20.6 and 26.9Â±24.8 ng/g fat , respectively .	
23435065-8	The results highlight the importance of timing of breast milk sampling for consistent exposure assessment estimation .	
23435065-9	Levels of pollutants in Hungarian breast milk samples were at the lower concentration range when data from Europe are considered .	
23435065-10	This is the first study in Hungary where each infant's daily intakes of PCBs and PCDD/Fs via breast milk have been measured .	24 2 243
23435065-11	The daily intakes of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs via breastfeeding per kg body weight were 11.79Â±6.42 , 16.54Â±13.02 and 11.59Â±7.70 pg TEQ/kg bw on days 5 , 12 and 84 , respectively .	24 2 243
23435065-12	The exposure was the highest on day 12 but at all three time points each infants ' daily exposure to PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs via breastfeeding exceeded the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) of 2 pg TEQ/kg bw per day .	24 2 243
23435065-13	These levels are still lower than corresponding levels recently measured in many European countries .	
23435065-14	Whether the milk-derived POP exposure levels of infants reported here constitute any health risk that may manifest later in life awaits further scrutiny .	
22534204-0	The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the relation between arsenic exposure from drinking water and plasma levels of markers of systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction ( matrix metalloproteinase-9 , myeloperoxidase , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , soluble E-selectin , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1) ) using baseline data from 668 participants ( age , &gt;30 years ) in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study in Bangladesh ( 2007-2008 ) .	11 24 1 2 241 11123 111 1112
22534204-1	Both well water arsenic and urinary arsenic were positively associated with plasma levels of soluble VCAM-1 .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
22534204-2	For every 1-unit increase in log-transformed well water arsenic ( ln Î¼g/L ) and urinary arsenic ( ln Î¼g/g creatinine ) , plasma soluble VCAM-1 was 1.02 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.01 , 1.03 ) and 1.04 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.01 , 1.07 ) times greater , respectively .	24 12 1 2 241 127
22534204-3	There was a significant interaction between arsenic exposure and higher body mass index , such that the increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and soluble VCAM-1 associated with arsenic exposure were stronger among people with higher body mass index .	11 1 11123 111 1112
22534204-4	The findings indicate an effect of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water on vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction that could be modified by body mass index and also suggest a potential mechanism underlying the association between arsenic exposure and cardiovascular disease .	24 2 241
21450549-0	BACKGROUND Bisphenol A ( BPA ) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) are high-production-volume chemicals used in plastics and resins for food packaging .	
21450549-1	They have been associated with endocrine disruption in animals and in some human studies .	
21450549-2	Human exposure sources have been estimated , but the relative contribution of dietary exposure to total intake has not been studied empirically .	
21450549-3	OBJECTIVES To evaluate the contribution of food packaging to exposure , we measured urinary BPA and phthalate metabolites before , during , and after a " fresh foods " dietary intervention .	24 12 1 2 243 127
21450549-4	METHODS We selected 20 participants in five families based on self-reported use of canned and packaged foods .	
21450549-5	Participants ate their usual diet , followed by 3 days of " fresh foods " that were not canned or packaged in plastic , and then returned to their usual diet .	24 2 243
21450549-6	We collected evening urine samples over 8 days in January 2010 and composited them into preintervention , during intervention , and postintervention samples .	1 12 127
21450549-7	We used mixed-effects models for repeated measures and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to assess change in urinary levels across time .	1 12 127
21450549-8	RESULTS Urine levels of BPA and DEHP metabolites decreased significantly during the fresh foods intervention [ e.g. , BPA geometric mean ( GM ) , 3.7 ng/mL preintervention vs. 1.2 ng/mL during intervention ; mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxy hexyl ) phthalate GM , 57 ng/mL vs. 25 ng/mL ] .	1 12 127
21450549-9	The intervention reduced GM concentrations of BPA by 66% and DEHP metabolites by 53-56% .	
21450549-10	Maxima were reduced by 76% for BPA and 93-96% for DEHP metabolites .	
21450549-11	CONCLUSIONS BPA and DEHP exposures were substantially reduced when participants ' diets were restricted to food with limited packaging .	
22504586-0	BACKGROUND Exposure to arsenic via drinking water has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant morbidity and mortality .	
22504586-1	Little is known , however , about the effects of arsenic on child growth .	
22504586-2	OBJECTIVE We assessed potential effects of early-life arsenic exposure on weight and length of children from birth to 2 years of age .	
22504586-3	METHODS We followed 2,372 infants born in a population-based intervention trial in rural Bangladesh .	
22504586-4	Exposure was assessed by arsenic concentrations in urine ( U-As ) of mothers ( gestational weeks 8 and 30 ) and children ( 18 months old ) .	1 12 127
22504586-5	Child anthropometry was measured monthly in the first year and quarterly in the second .	1 11 112
22504586-6	Linear regression models were used to examine associations of U-As ( by quintiles ) with child weight and length , adjusted for age , maternal body mass index , socioeconomic status , and sex ( or stratified by sex ) .	1 11 112
22504586-7	RESULTS Median ( 10th-90th percentiles ) U-As concentrations were about 80 ( 25-400 ) Âµg/L in the mothers and 34 ( 12-159 ) Âµg/L in the children .	
22504586-8	Inverse associations of maternal U-As with child's attained weight and length at 3-24 months were markedly attenuated after adjustment .	
22504586-9	However , associations of U-As at 18 months with weight and length at 18-24 months were more robust , particularly in girls .	
22504586-10	Compared with girls in the first quintile of U-As ( &lt ; 16 Âµg/L ) , those in the fourth quintile ( 26-46 Âµg/L ) were almost 300 g lighter and 0.7 cm shorter , and had adjusted odds ratios ( 95% confidence interval ) for underweight and stunting of 1.57 ( 1.02-2.40 ) and 1.58 ( 1.05-2.37 ) , respectively , at 21 months .	
22504586-11	CONCLUSIONS Postnatal arsenic exposure was associated with lower body weight and length among girls , but not boys .	
17107847-0	BACKGROUND Observations of adverse developmental and reproductive effects in laboratory animals and wildlife have fueled increasing public concern regarding the potential for various chemicals to impair human fertility .	
17107847-1	OBJECTIVE Our objective in this study was to assess the effect of occupational exposure to high levels of phthalate esters on the balance of gonadotropin and gonadal hormones including luteinizing hormone , follicle-stimulating hormone , free testosterone ( fT ) , and estradiol .	11 1 11121 11123 111 1112
17107847-2	METHODS We examined urine and blood samples of 74 male workers at a factory producing unfoamed polyvinyl chloride flooring exposed to di-n-butyl phthalate ( DBP ) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) and compared them with samples from 63 male workers from a construction company , group matched for age and smoking status .	1 122 12 127
17107847-3	RESULTS Compared to the unexposed workers , the exposed workers had substantially and significantly elevated concentrations of mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MBP ; 644.3 vs. 129.6 microg/g creatinine , p &lt ; 0.001 ) and mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP ; 565.7 vs. 5.7 microg/g creatinine , p &lt ; 0.001). fT was significantly lower ( 8.4 vs. 9.7 microg/g creatinine , p = 0.019 ) in exposed workers than in unexposed workers. fT was negatively correlated to MBP ( r = -0.25 , p = 0.03 ) and MEHP ( r = -0.19 , p = 0.095 ) in the exposed worker group .	
17107847-4	Regression analyses revealed that fT decreases significantly with increasing total phthalate ester score ( the sum of quartiles of MBP and MEHP ; r = -0.26 , p = 0.002 ) .	
17107847-5	CONCLUSION We observed a modest and significant reduction of serum fT in workers with higher levels of urinary MBP and MEHP compared with unexposed workers .	1 12 127
22466225-0	BACKGROUND Arsenic is an epigenetic toxicant and could influence fetal developmental programming .	
22466225-1	OBJECTIVES We evaluated the association between arsenic exposure and DNA methylation in maternal and umbilical cord leukocytes .	
22466225-2	METHODS Drinking-water and urine samples were collected when women were at â¤ 28 weeks gestation ; the samples were analyzed for arsenic using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .	24 12 1 2 241 127
22466225-3	DNA methylation at CpG sites in p16 ( n = 7 ) and p53 ( n = 4 ) , and in LINE-1 and Alu repetitive elements ( 3 CpG sites in each ) , was quantified using pyrosequencing in 113 pairs of maternal and umbilical blood samples .	1111 1 111 11
22466225-4	We used general linear models to evaluate the relationship between DNA methylation and tertiles of arsenic exposure .	1111 1 111 11
22466225-5	RESULTS Mean ( Â± SD ) drinking-water arsenic concentration was 14.8 Â± 36.2 Î¼g/L ( range : &lt ; 1-230 Î¼g/L ) .	24 2 241
22466225-6	Methylation in LINE-1 increased by 1.36% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.52 , 2.21% ] and 1.08% ( 95% CI : 0.07 , 2.10% ) in umbilical cord and maternal leukocytes , respectively , in association with the highest versus lowest tertile of total urinary arsenic per gram creatinine .	11 1111 12 1 111 127
22466225-7	Arsenic exposure was also associated with higher methylation of some of the tested CpG sites in the promoter region of p16 in umbilical cord and maternal leukocytes .	1111 1 111 11
22466225-8	No associations were observed for Alu or p53 methylation .	
22466225-9	CONCLUSIONS Exposure to higher levels of arsenic was positively associated with DNA methylation in LINE-1 repeated elements , and to a lesser degree at CpG sites within the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene p16 .	
22466225-10	Associations were observed in both maternal and fetal leukocytes .	
22466225-11	Future research is needed to confirm these results and determine if these small increases in methylation are associated with any health effects .	
17107851-0	BACKGROUND 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) and some related environmental contaminants are aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) ligands that exert reproductive and developmental toxicity in laboratory animals .	
17107851-1	In humans , fertility-related effects are less documented .	
17107851-2	OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between dioxin-like biological activity in serum and parameters of reproductive status in men from the general population 5 months after a polychlorinated biphenyl and dioxin food-contamination episode in Belgium .	
17107851-3	DESIGN In the framework of the cross-sectional Flemish Environment and Health Study ( FLEHS ) , we recruited 101 men 20-40 years of age and evaluated sperm parameters , measured sex hormones , and gathered information on a number of lifestyle factors .	11 1 1112 111 112
17107851-4	In addition , we determined the AhR-mediated enzymatic response elicited by individual serum samples and expressed it as TCDD equivalent concentrations ( CALUX-TEQs ) using an established transactivation assay .	1 122 12
17107851-5	RESULTS Age ( p = 0.04 ) and the frequency of fish ( p = 0.02 ) and egg ( p = 0.001 ) consumption were independent positive determinants of serum dioxin-like activity .	24 2 243
17107851-6	After correcting for possible confounders , we found that a 2-fold increase in CALUX-TEQ &gt ; 16 pg/L was associated with a 7.1% and 6.8% ( both p = 0.04 ) decrease in total and free testosterone , respectively .	11 1 1112 111 11121
17107851-7	We also observed a more pronounced drop in semen volume of 16.0% ( p = 0.03 ) , whereas sperm concentration rose by 25.2% ( p = 0.07 ) .	1 11 112
17107851-8	No relationship was found with total sperm count or sperm morphology .	1 11 112
17107851-9	CONCLUSIONS These data suggest an interaction of dioxin-like compounds with the secretory function of the seminal vesicles or prostate , possibly indirectly through an effect on testosterone secretion , at levels not affecting spermatogenesis as such .	
21440302-0	BACKGROUND Phthalate and phenol exposure is prevalent among the general population and of potential concern for pregnant women and children because of their suspected susceptibility to endocrine effects .	
21440302-1	OBJECTIVES To evaluate the extent of exposure to several phthalates and phenols in a sample of Spanish pregnant women - according to their individual characteristics ( age , social class , education , and body mass index ) - and children who participated in the INMA - Infancia y Medio Ambiente ( Environment and Childhood ) project .	
21440302-2	METHODS One spot urine sample was taken during the third trimester of pregnancy from 120 pregnant women and from 30 4-year old children belonging to 5 Spanish birth cohorts , and analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenols .	1 12 127
21440302-3	RESULTS Three metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate , mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate , mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate , and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate ; two metabolites of dibutyl phthalates , mono-isobutyl phthalate and mono-n-butyl phthalate ; monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , the main metabolite of diethyl phthalate ; and two phenols , methyl paraben ( M-PB ) and 2,5-dichlorophenol were detected in the urine samples of all women .	1 12 127
21440302-4	The highest urinary concentrations were for MEP and M-PB .	1 12 127
21440302-5	Urinary concentrations of all phthalate metabolites and of 2,4-dichlorophenol , 2,5-dichlorophenol , and bisphenol A were lower in the pregnant women than in the children .	1 12 127
21440302-6	Among women , a positive relationship with social class and education was shown for most of the phthalate metabolites and phenols .	
21440302-7	Almost all phthalate metabolites varied by region even after adjusting for social class and education .	
21440302-8	CONCLUSIONS Phthalate and phenol exposures are prevalent in a group of pregnant women and young children , two susceptible populations , and these exposures might be positively related to social class .	
19744554-0	BACKGROUND Environmental prenatal exposure to potentially neurotoxic metals poses a particular challenge with regard to the study of early toxic effects .	
19744554-1	Monoamine oxidase activity , shown to be influenced by metals in experimental studies , could be a useful biomarker in humans .	
19744554-2	OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between blood metal concentrations at delivery and placenta MAO activity .	1 11 1113 111
19744554-3	METHODS The study was performed in 163 pregnancies .	
19744554-4	Maternal and cord blood samples were obtained for manganese ( Mn ) , lead ( Pb ) , and cadmium ( Cd ) determination .	1 122 12
19744554-5	Mercury ( Hg ) was also analysed in maternal hair .	1 12 123
19744554-6	Placental samples were stored immediately after expulsion and total MAO activity was measured .	1 11 1113 111
19744554-7	RESULTS MAO activity was significantly positively correlated with maternal and cord blood Mn concentrations in subjects with high MAO activity .	1 122 12
19744554-8	In subjects with low MAO activity , maternal hair Hg was negatively correlated with MAO .	1 12 123
19744554-9	CONCLUSION Our results suggest the use of placental MAO as a potential surrogate marker of Mn toxicity in the newborn and its correlation with psychomotor development should be further investigated .	
17120554-0	Lack of human exposure data is frequently reported as a critical gap in risk assessments of environmental pollutants , especially regarding " new " pollutants .	
17120554-1	The objectives of this study were to assess serum levels of the persistent 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl ( CB-153 ) , hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites ( OH-PCBs ) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , and hexabromocyclodode-canes ( HBCDDs ) in a group of Swedish middle-aged and elderly women expected to be relatively highly exposed , and to evaluate the impact of potential determinants ( e.g. , fish intake , age ) for the inter-individual variation , as well as to investigate the association between these pollutants and bone density .	11 24 12 1 122 2 243 112
17120554-2	No associations were found between bone mineral density or biochemical markers of bone metabolism and the analyzed environmental pollutants .	1 11 111 112
17120554-3	Relatively high levels of CB-153 ( median 260 ng/g fat ) and sigma 3-OH-PCBs ( median 1.7 ng/mL serum ) , and low concentrations of sigma6PBDEs ( median 3.6 ng/g fat ) were determined .	1 122 12
17120554-4	Total level of HBCDDs in serum was quantified by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection ( median 0.5 ng/g fat ) .	1 122 12
17120554-5	HBCDD diastereomeric and enantiomeric patterns were determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection .	
17120554-6	The dominating stereoisomer was ( -)alpha-HBCDD , but 1-3% of gamma-HBCDD was also detected in the serum samples .	1 122 12
19777169-0	This study investigates mercury , lead , copper , and zinc concentrations in six most frequently consumed fish species ( 120 samples ) , sediments ( 20 samples ) taken from Karaduvar Fishing Area where fish species live , and Mersin Port as a contrary region , and human scalp hair for people regularly consuming these fish species ( 50 samples ) and non-fish-eaters ( 15 samples ) in Mersin , Turkey .	24 12 1 123 243 2
19777169-1	On taking living environment into account , the fish groups include pelagic species of Liza saliens , Liza aurata , and demersal species of Merluccius merluccius , Mullus barbatus , Upeneus moluccensis , and Solea solea .	
19777169-2	Total Hg ( THg ) was found to accumulate in muscle tissues at the lowest concentration ( 0.01 microg/g ) in L. saliens and at the highest ( 2.66 microg/g ) in S. solea .	
19777169-3	Pb was only detected at high concentrations of 1.86 microg/g in M. barbatus and of 2.16 microg/g in M. merluccius .	
19777169-4	Cu and Zn concentrations were below the detection limit within all fish species .	
19777169-5	In the sediment samples , Pb and Cu concentrations were persistently below their effect range-median ( ERM ) value , whereas this limiting value only maintained for 15% of THg concentrations .	
19777169-6	On the other hand , the effect range-low ( ERL ) of sediment exceeded at Pb in 15% of samples and Cu in 25% of samples .	
19777169-7	Zn remained below the detection limit for sediment samples .	
19777169-8	The metal concentrations at scalp hairs of regular consumers of these fish groups and non-fish eaters vary from the range 0.40-3.28 to 0.14-1.02 microg/g for THg , 11.16-107.84 to 8.00-22.38 microg/g for Pb , and 151.67-645.35 to 144.92-343.50 microg/g for Zn .	24 12 1 123 243 2
19777169-9	An important finding of the present study is the significant adverse impact of sedimentary heavy metal bioaccumulation to human through the consumption of demersal fishes in the city of Mersin along the southern coast of Turkey .	
17126883-0	The aim of this study was to measure , 6 years after regular operations , the concentrations of a number of organic substances in blood and urine of 19 workers employed at a hazardous waste incinerator ( HWI ) in Spain , and to establish the temporal variation with respect to baseline data and previously performed surveys .	1 122 12 127
17126883-1	This facility was the first , and so far the only HWI in that country .	
17126883-2	The levels of hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB 28 , 52 , 101 , 138 , 153 and 180 ) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) were analyzed in six composite plasma samples , while concentrations of di- , tri , and pentachlorophenols , as well those of 1-hydroxypyrene were measured in the urine of these workers .	1 122 12 127
17126883-3	The current mean PCDD/F concentration , 10.4 ng I-TEQ/kg lipid , was significantly lower than that found in the baseline survey , 26.7 ng I-TEQ/kg lipid and similar to that found in the previous ( 2004 ) study ( 7.7 ng I-TEQ/kg lipid ) .	
17126883-4	PCDD/F levels in plasma were similar or even lower than those recently reported for various non-exposed populations .	1 122 12
17126883-5	For the remaining analyzed substances in plasma and urine , there was not any significant increase in comparison with the levels found in the baseline survey .	1 122 12 127
17126883-6	On the other hand , no marked differences between the concentrations of organic substances in plasma or urine were found according to the respective workplace ( plant , laboratory and administration ) .	
17126883-7	The results of the present survey indicate that after 6 years of regular operation , the workers at the HWI are not occupationally exposed to PCDD/Fs and other organic substances in their workplaces .	
19796858-0	Prior to this study , reports of occurrence of polycyclic musks and polychlorinated naphthalenes ( PCNs ) in human tissues from Italy were not available .	
19796858-1	In this study , concentrations of PCNs and polycyclic musks were determined in human adipose tissue from Italy collected during 2005-2006 ; for comparison , legacy organohalogen pollutants such as organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were determined .	1 121 12
19796858-2	SigmaPCN concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 14 ng/g lipid wt ( lw ) .	
19796858-3	Polycyclic musks such as HHCB and AHTN were found in 92% and 83% of the human samples , respectively .	
19796858-4	Concentrations of PBDEs in Italian adipose tissue ranged between 3.2 and 35.6 ng/g lw .	1 121 12
19834714-0	PURPOSE Chronic arsenic exposure at levels found in US drinking water has been associated with bladder cancer .	
19834714-1	While arsenic is a known carcinogen , recent studies suggest that it is useful as a therapeutic agent for leukemia .	
19834714-2	This study examined the relationship between arsenic exposure and bladder cancer mortality .	
19834714-3	METHODS We studied 832 cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in New Hampshire from a population-based case-control study .	
19834714-4	Individual exposure to arsenic was determined in home drinking water using ICP-MS and in toenail samples by instrumental neutron activation analysis .	24 12 1 123 241 2
19834714-5	RESULTS Among the high arsenic exposure group , found using toenail arsenic level or arsenic consumption , cases experienced a de-escalated survival hazard ratio ( HR ) [ high ( &gt ; or =75 percent ) versus low ( &lt;25th percentile ) toenail arsenic overall survival HR 0.5 ( 95% CI 0.4-0.8) ] , controlled for tumor stage , grade , gender , age and treatment regimen .	1 123 12
19834714-6	This association was found largely among invasive tumors , in smokers and was not modified by TP53 status .	
19834714-7	Bladder cancer cause-specific survival showed a similar trend , but did not reach statistical significance [ HR 0.5 ( 95% CI 0.3-1.1) ] .	
19834714-8	CONCLUSIONS Arsenic exposure may be related to the survival of patients with bladder cancer .	
17157453-0	Urban air pollution resulting from traffic is a major problem in many cities in Asia , including Bangkok , Thailand .	
17157453-1	This pollution originates mainly from incomplete fossil fuel combustion , e.g. transportation , and the composition of which is very complex .	
17157453-2	Some of the compounds are carcinogenic in experimental animals and in man .	
17157453-3	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) and benzene are among the major carcinogenic compounds found in urban air pollution from motor vehicle emissions .	
17157453-4	In major cities in Asia , the levels of PAHs and benzene are relatively high compared with those in Europe or in the United States and thus people are exposed to higher levels .	
17157453-5	Biomarkers of exposure and early biological effects have been used to study the potential health effects of exposure to PAHs and benzene in air pollution in school children attending schools in inner-city Bangkok compared to those attending schools in rural areas .	1 122 12 127
17157453-6	Bangkok school children are exposed to total PAHs at levels 3.5-fold higher than those in the rural area .	
17157453-7	Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene , a metabolite of PAH , was also significantly higher , while PAH-DNA adducts in lymphocytes were five-fold higher in Bangkok school children than rural school children .	1 12 127
17157453-8	Benzene exposure in Bangkok school children was approximately two-fold higher than in rural school children .	
17157453-9	This is in agreement with the levels of biomarkers of internal benzene dose , i.e. blood benzene and urinary t,t-muconic acid .	1 122 12 127
17157453-10	The potential health risks from exposure to genotoxic substances were assessed through DNA-damage levels and DNA repair capacity .	
17157453-11	DNA strand breaks were significantly higher , whereas DNA repair capacity was significantly reduced in Bangkok children .	1111 1 111 11
17157453-12	Genetic polymorphisms have been detected in glutathione-S-transferases ( GSTs ) and cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) enzymes involved in the metabolism of benzene and PAHs , but these polymorphisms had no significant effects on the biomarkers of PAH exposure .	
17157453-13	Our results indicate that children living in a mega city such as Bangkok may have an increased health risk of the development of certain diseases due to exposure to genotoxic substances in air pollution compared to children living in suburban/rural areas .	
17161894-0	In recent years , and based on the importance of fish as a part of a healthy diet , there has been a notable promotion of fish consumption .	
17161894-1	However , the balance between health benefits and risks , due to the intake of chemical contaminants , is not well characterized .	
17161894-2	In the present study , edible samples of 14 marine species were analyzed for the concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids , as well as a number of metals and organic pollutants .	
17161894-3	Daily intakes were specifically determined for a standard adult of 70kg , and compared with the tolerable/admissible intakes of the pollutants , if available .	24 2
17161894-4	Salmon , mackerel , and red mullet were the species showing the highest content of omega-3 fatty acids .	
17161894-5	The daily intakes of cadmium , lead , and mercury through fish consumption were 1.1 , 2.0 , and 9.9microg , respectively .	24 2 243
17161894-6	Dioxins and furans plus dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) intake was 38.0pg WHO-TEQ/day , whereas those of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated diphenyl ethers ( PCDEs ) , polychlorinated naphthalenes ( PCNs ) and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) were 20.8 , 39.4 , 1.53 , and 1.50ng/day , respectively .	
17161894-7	In turn , the total intake of 16 analyzed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) was 268ng/day .	
17161894-8	The monthly fish consumption limits for human health endpoints based on the intake of these chemical contaminants were calculated for a 70 years exposure .	24 2 243
17161894-9	In general terms , most marine species here analyzed should not mean adverse health effects for the consumers .	
17161894-10	However , the type of fish , the frequency of consumption , and the meal size are essential issues for the balance of the health benefits and risks of regular fish consumption .	
22336529-0	Environmental measurements carried out by local authorities during the 1970s , 80s and 90s in an area contaminated by hundreds of years of industrial activities have revealed high levels of zinc ( Zn ) , copper ( Cu ) , lead ( Pb ) and cadmium ( Cd ) in soil , vegetables , root crops , berries and mushrooms .	
22336529-1	In 1972 , a large quantity of oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) was accidentally spilled into the river running through the village .	
22336529-2	To investigate the possible health effects of exposure from local sources , all cancer diagnoses , registered in 1960-2003 for individuals living in the study area , were collected from the regional cancer register of southeast Sweden .	
22336529-3	The total cancer incidence was non-significantly decreased both among males and females as compared to national rates ( SIR=0.91 ) for each gender .	
22336529-4	Among males , increased risks , of border-line significance , were seen for testicular cancer and lymphomas as well as significantly decreased risks for cancer in the rectum , respiratory system and brain .	
22336529-5	Information on lifetime residence , occupation , smoking habits , diseases , childbirth and food consumption , was collected via questionnaires from cancer cases and randomly selected controls .	
22336529-6	In both genders combined , significant associations were found for total cancer and high consumption of local perch , and for lymphomas and high consumption of both perch and pikeperch .	24 2 243
22336529-7	Female breast cancer was significantly associated with high consumption of local perch and pike as well as with work in metal production .	24 2 243
22336529-8	Mothers residing in the parish before the age of five reported significantly more preterm child deliveries .	
22336529-9	In spite of study limitations , the results indicate that residing in a rural contaminated area may contribute to the development of certain cancers and reproductive effects .	
22336529-10	In females , high consumption of local fish was shown to be the strongest determinant for total cancer , while in males , the strongest determinant was residing in the study area the first five years of life .	24 2 243
22336529-11	Further research including validation of exposure using biomarkers is required to verify the findings as well as future studies in other polluted areas in Sweden with larger population bases .	
21406311-0	Phthalates have long been used as plasticizers to soften plastic products and , thus , are ubiquitous in modern life .	
21406311-1	As part of the Bavarian Monitoring of Breast Milk ( BAMBI ) , we aimed to characterize the exposure of infants to phthalates in Germany .	
21406311-2	Overall , 15 phthalates , including di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) , di-isobutyl phthalate ( DiBP ) , di-isononyl phthalate ( DiNP ) , three primary metabolites of DEHP [ mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) , mono-isobutyl phthalate ( MiBP ) , and mono-n-butyl phthalate ( MnBP) ] , and two secondary metabolites of DEHP were analyzed in 78 breast milk samples .	1 12 124
21406311-3	We found median concentrations of 3.9 ng/g for DEHP , 0.8 ng/g for DnBP , and 1.2 ng/g for DiBP , while other parent phthalates were found in only some or none of the samples at levels above the limit of quantitation .	
21406311-4	In infant formula ( n=4 ) we observed mean values of 19.7 ng/g ( DEHP ) , 3.8 ng/g ( DnBP ) , and 3.6 ng/g ( DiBP ) .	
21406311-5	For MEHP , MiBP , and MnBP , the median values in breast milk were 2.3 Î¼g/l , 11.8 Î¼g/l , and 2.1 Î¼g/l , respectively .	1 12 124
21406311-6	The secondary metabolites were not detected in any samples .	
21406311-7	Using median and 95th percentile values , we estimated an " average " and " high " daily intake for an exclusively breast-fed infant of 0.6 Î¼g/kg body weight ( b.w. ) and 2.1 Î¼g/kg b.w. , respectively , for DEHP , 0.1 Î¼g/kg b.w. and 0.5 Î¼g/kg b.w. for DnBP , and 0.2 Î¼g/kg b.w. and 0.7 Î¼g/kg b.w. for DiBP .	24 2 243
21406311-8	For DiNP , intake values were 3.2 Î¼g/kg b.w. and 6.4 Î¼g/kg b.w. , respectively , if all values in milk were set half of the detection limit or the detection limit .	
21406311-9	The above-mentioned " average " and " high " intake values corresponded to only about 2% to 7% , respectively , of the recommended tolerable daily intake .	
21406311-10	Thus , it is not likely that an infant's exposure to phthalates from breast milk poses any significant health risk .	
21406311-11	Nevertheless , other sources of phthalates in this vulnerable phase have to be considered .	
21406311-12	Moreover , it should be noted that for infants nourished with formula , phthalate intake is of the same magnitude or slightly higher ( DEHP ) than for exclusively breast-fed infants .	24 2 243
17175009-0	A role of cadmium exposure in prostate cancer etiology has been suggested by epidemiologic and laboratory studies , but conclusive evidence on this topic is still lacking .	
17175009-1	We investigated the relation between cadmium exposure , estimated by determining toenails cadmium levels , and prostate cancer risk in forty patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and fifty-eight hospital controls recruited in two provinces from southern and northern Italy .	1 123 12
17175009-2	We found an excess cancer risk in subjects in the third and fourth ( highest ) quartiles of toenail cadmium concentration ( odds ratio 1.3 and 4.7 , respectively ) compared with subjects in the bottom quartile .	
17175009-3	Results were basically unchanged when limiting the analysis to each province or entering toenail cadmium concentrations as continuous values in the regression model ( P=0.004 ) .	
17175009-4	Despite the limited statistical stability of the point estimates , these findings appear to support the hypothesis that cadmium exposure increases prostate cancer risk .	
17185035-0	Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) is a general-purpose plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) and has become a ubiquitous environmental contaminant .	
17185035-1	It is suspected to be an endocrine disrupting/modulating substance in humans .	
17185035-2	Children are of special concern due to their developmental state .	
17185035-3	In our study we estimated the daily DEHP intake of 239 children aged 2-14 years by extrapolating from their urinary levels of the DEHP metabolites mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalate ( 5OH-MEHP ) , mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate ( 5oxo-MEHP ) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( MEHP ) .	1 2 12 21 127
17185035-4	We applied two calculation models based upon the volume and the creatinine-related urinary metabolite concentrations .	1 12 127
17185035-5	Applying the volume- or the creatinine-based calculation model we determined a median daily DEHP intake of 7.8 or 4.3 microg/kgbody weight ( bw)/day and a 95th percentile of 25.2 or 15.2 microg/kgbw/day .	2
17185035-6	Three children ( 1% ) exceeded the value of the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) of the European Food Safety Authority of 50 microg/kgbw/day , while 7.5% or 3% ( depending on the calculation model ) exceeded the reference dose ( RfD ) of 20 microg/kgbw/day of the US Environmental Protection Agency .	
17185035-7	In general , DEHP exposure was decreasing with increasing age and boys had higher exposures than girls .	
17185035-8	Our findings suggest that the majority of the children in the general population is exposed to quantities of DEHP below the TDI and the RfD .	
17185035-9	However , many children scoop out the preventive limit values to a considerable degree and in individual cases we observed substantial transgressions .	
17185035-10	Younger children seem to be more severely burdened , which may be due to a higher food consumption related to their bw , mouthing behaviour and/or playing near the ground .	
21058701-0	Few studies have investigated the human exposure to the ensemble of dioxin-related compounds ( DRCs ) released from uncontrolled e-waste recycling , especially from a toxic effect standpoint .	
21058701-1	This study evaluated the TCDD toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) in persistent extracts of settled house dust from two Vietnamese e-waste recycling sites ( EWRSs ) using the Dioxin-Responsive Chemically Activated LUciferase gene eXpression assay ( DR-CALUX ) , combined with chemical analysis of PCDD/Fs , DL-PCBs , PBDD/Fs , and monobromo PCDD/Fs to determine their TEQ contribution .	24 2 242
21058701-2	The CALUX-TEQ levels in house dust ranged from 370 to 1000 pg g(-1) in the EWRSs , approximately 3.5-fold higher than in the urban control site .	24 2 242
21058701-3	In EWRS house dust , the concentrations of the unregulated PBDFs were 7.7-63 ng g(-1) , an order of magnitude higher than those of regulated DRCs ( PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs ) , and PBDFs were also principal CALUX-TEQ contributors ( 4.2-22% ) , comparable to PCDD/Fs ( 8.1-29% ) .	24 2 242
21058701-4	The CALUX-TEQ contribution of DRCs varied , possibly depending on thermal processing activities ( higher PCDD/F-TEQs ) and PBDE content in the waste ( higher PBDF-TEQs ) .	
21058701-5	However , the percentage of unknown dioxin-like activities was high in all dust samples , indicating large contribution from unidentified DRCs and/or synergy among contaminants .	
21058701-6	Estimates of TEQ intake from dust ingestion suggest that children in the EWRSs may be adversely affected by DRCs from dust .	24 2 242
17185274-0	BACKGROUND The objective of this population-based case-referent study in Matlab , Bangladesh , was to assess the susceptibility to arsenic-induced skin lesions by age and sex , in a population drinking water from As-contaminated tube wells .	24 2 241
17185274-1	METHODS Identification of As-related skin lesions was carried out in three steps : a ) screening of the entire population &gt ; 4 years of age ( n = 166,934 ) by trained field teams ; b ) diagnosis of suspected As-related cases by physicians ; and c ) confirmation by experts based on physicians ' records and photographs .	1 11 112
17185274-2	A total of 504 cases with skin lesions were confirmed .	
17185274-3	We randomly selected 2,201 referents from the Matlab health and demographic surveillance system ; 1,955 were eligible , and 1,830 ( 94% ) were available for participation in the study .	
17185274-4	Individual history of As exposure was based on information obtained during interviews and included all drinking-water sources used since 1970 and concentrations of As ( assessed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry ) in all the tube wells used .	24 2 241
17185274-5	RESULTS Cases had been exposed to As more than referents ( average exposure since 1970 : male cases , 200 microg/L ; female cases , 211 microg/L ; male referents , 143 microg/L ; female referents , 155 microg/L ) .	
17185274-6	We found a dose-response relationship for both sexes ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) and increased risk with increasing socioeconomic status .	
17185274-7	Males had a higher risk of obtaining skin lesions than females ( odds ratio 10.9 vs. 5.78 ) in the highest average exposure quintile ( p = 0.005 ) .	
17185274-8	Start of As exposure ( cumulative exposure ) before 1 year of age was not associated with higher risk of obtaining skin lesions compared to start of As exposure later in life .	
17185274-9	CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that males are more susceptible than females to develop skin lesions when exposed to As in water from tube wells .	
21395215-0	The occurrence of 14 phthalate metabolites was found in human urine samples collected from seven Asian countries : China , India , Japan , Korea , Kuwait , Malaysia , and Vietnam .	
21395215-1	Phthalate metabolites were found in all samples , indicating widespread exposure of humans to phthalates in these Asian countries .	
21395215-2	The highest total ( the sum of 14 phthalates ) phthalate metabolite concentrations were found in samples collected from Kuwait ( median : 1050 ng/mL ) , followed in decreasing order by samples from India ( 389 ng/mL ) , China ( 234 ng/mL ) , Vietnam ( 133 ng/mL ) , Japan ( 120 ng/mL ) , Korea ( 117 ng/mL ) , and Malaysia ( 94.9 ng/mL ) .	
21395215-3	The creatinine-adjusted median concentrations of total phthalates for urine samples from Kuwait , India , China , Vietnam , Japan , Korea , and Malaysia were 692 , 506 , 289 , 119 , 103 , 104 , and 169 Î¼g/g creatinine , respectively .	1 12 127
21395215-4	Monomethyl phthalate ( mMP ) , monoethyl phthalate ( mEP ) , mono ( 2-isobutyl phthalate ) ( miBP ) , mono-n-butyl phthalate ( mBP ) , and metabolites of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) were the dominant compounds , collectively accounting for &gt;95% of the total concentrations in the samples from the seven countries .	
21395215-5	The profiles of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations varied among the samples collected from the seven countries .	1 12 127
21395215-6	Urine samples from Kuwait contained the highest concentrations of mEP ( median : 391 ng/mL ) , mBP ( 94.1 ng/mL ) , and the metabolites of DEHP ( 202 ng/mL ) , whereas samples from China and Japan contained the highest concentrations of miBP ( 50.8 ng/mL ) and mMP ( 17.5 ng/mL ) , respectively. mEP was the predominant metabolite in urine samples from India and Kuwait ( accounting for 49% of the total ) , mBP and miBP were the predominant compounds in samples from China ( 52% ) , and DEHP metabolites were the predominant compounds in samples from Korea ( 46% ) and Vietnam ( 52% ) .	1 12 127
21395215-7	Based on the urinary concentrations of mEP , mBP , miBP , and DEHP metabolites of the samples from the seven Asian countries , we estimated daily intake rates of diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) , dibutyl phthalate ( DBP ) , and DEHP .	1 2 12 21 127
21395215-8	The results indicated that people in the seven Asian countries are exposed to DEP , DBP , and DEHP at levels well below the reference doses ( RfD ) suggested as unsafe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .	
21395215-9	The estimated exposure doses to DEHP in Kuwait , however , were above the RfD recommended by the EPA .	
20007123-0	Amalgam has been used as a filling material for over 150 years .	
20007123-1	Mercury , copper , and zinc are present in restoration .	
20007123-2	The aim of this study was to compare mercury , copper , and zinc concentrations in extracted human teeth with amalgam restorations and teeth without restorations .	24 12 1 244 2 125
20007123-3	Thirty-two teeth , 15 restored with dental amalgam and 17 without restorations , were chemically analyzed in an Optima 3300 DV ( Perkin Elmer ) plasma emission spectrometer .	24 244 2
20007123-4	Mercury , copper , and zinc were found in human teeth regardless of the presence of amalgam restorations .	24 12 1 244 2 125
20007123-5	The highest mercury concentrations were found in the coronary portions of the teeth with amalgam restorations .	1 12 125
20007123-6	Copper concentrations were very high .	
20007123-7	Zinc concentrations in the teeth without restoration were lower than those seen in the coronary portion of the teeth with restorations .	1 12 125
20956086-0	A somewhat detailed study was carried out in Gaighata , one of the 107 arsenic-affected blocks in West Bengal , India , to determine the degree of groundwater contamination with arsenic , its depth wise distribution , correlation with iron , arsenical health effects to the inhabitants and the factors responsible for arsenic poisoning .	
20956086-1	Groundwater in all the 107 mouzas over 13 gram-panchayets in Gaighata block contains arsenic above 0.01mgl(-1) and in 91 mouzas , arsenic concentration has been found above 0.05mgl(-1) .	
20956086-2	About 59.2 and 40.3% of the tubewell water samples contain arsenic above 0.01 and 0.05mgl(-1) , respectively .	
20956086-3	The approximate population drinking arsenic-contaminated water above 0.01 and 0.05mgl(-1) are 106,560 and 72,540 , respectively .	
20956086-4	The tubewells that were installed within the depth range of 15.4-30.3m are mostly arsenic-contaminated .	
20956086-5	Even the shallow groundwater level ( 7.87-15.1m ) is arsenic-contaminated .	
20956086-6	Both arsenic and iron concentrations in groundwater gradually increase from lower depth to higher depth up to 39.4m , and then decrease with increasing depth .	
20956086-7	About 58% of the deep tubewell water samples ( depth range 122-182m , n=31 ) contain arsenic â¥0.05mgl(-1) .	
20956086-8	About 72% of the arsenic-contaminated deep tubewells ( n=18 ) were safe when surveyed first time .	
20956086-9	But within a span of 2-5 years , they became contaminated with arsenic .	
20956086-10	The linear regression shows direct correlation between arsenic and iron concentrations in groundwater ( r(2)=0.8114 , p&lt;0.0001 , n=912 ) .	
20956086-11	Intakes of inorganic arsenic from water by an adult male and female in the surveyed areas are 11.7 and 13.1Î¼g/kg body wt./day , respectively and these values are higher than the WHO recommended PTDI value of inorganic arsenic ( 2.1Î¼g/kg body wt./day ) .	24 2 241
20956086-12	Mean arsenic concentrations in urine , hair and nail samples , collected from the inhabitants of Gutri mouza are higher than their normal level and the values are 292Î¼gl(-1) ( range : 8.35-1024Î¼g l(-1) , n=193 ) , 2.50mgkg(-1) ( range : 0.17-5.99mgkg(-1) , n=132 ) , and 6.05mgkg(-1) ( range : 0.55-16.7mgkg(-1) , n=116 ) , respectively .	1 123 12 127
20956086-13	About 83% and 68% of the urine samples ( n=250 ) contain arsenic above 100 and 200Î¼gl(-1) , respectively .	1 12 127
20956086-14	Linear regressions show very good correlations between arsenic concentrations in water vs. urine , hair and nail samples from the inhabitants ( n=103 ) of Gutri mouza .	1 123 12 127
20956086-15	About 18.3% of the population ( n=930 ) were registered with arsenical skin lesions .	
20875913-0	Mercury use in small-scale gold mining is ubiquitous across Ghana but little is known about the extent to which such activities have contaminated community residents and miners .	
20875913-1	Here , occupational exposures to elemental mercury ( via urine sampling ) and dietary exposures to methylmercury ( via hair sampling ) were assessed among 120 participants recruited from a mining community located in the Talensi-Nabdam District of Ghana's Upper East region during summer 2009 .	1 123 12 127
20875913-2	More than one-fifth of the participants had moderately high levels of urinary mercury ( &gt;10Î¼g/L ) and 5% had urine mercury levels that exceeded the WHO guideline value of 50Î¼g/L .	1 12 127
20875913-3	When participants were stratified according to occupation , those active in the mining industry had the highest mercury levels .	
20875913-4	Specifically , individuals that burned amalgam had urine mercury levels ( median : 43.8Î¼g/L ; mean Â± SD : 171.1Â±296.5Î¼g/L ; n=5 ) significantly higher than median values measured in mechanical operators ( 11.6Î¼g/L , n=4 ) , concession managers/owners ( 5.6Î¼g/L , n=11 ) , excavators that blast and chisel ore ( 4.9Î¼g/L , n=33 ) , individuals that sift and grind crushed ore ( 2.2Î¼g/L , n=47 ) , support workers ( 0.5Î¼g/L , n=14 ) , and those with no role in the mining sector ( 2.5Î¼g/L , n=6 ) .	1 12 127
20875913-5	There was a significant positive Spearman correlation between fish consumption and hair mercury levels ( r=0.30 ) but not with urine mercury ( r=0.18 ) though further studies are needed to document which types of fish are consumed as well as portion sizes .	24 12 1 123 243 2
20875913-6	Given that 200,000 people in Ghana are involved in the small-scale gold mining industry and that the numbers are expected to grow in Ghana and many other regions of the world , elucidating mercury exposure pathways in such communities is important to help shape policies and behaviors that may minimize health risks .	
17258374-0	It has previously been reported that heat-treated carbohydrate rich foods may contain high levels of acrylamide resulting in consumers being inadvertently exposed to acrylamide .	
17258374-1	Acrylamide is mainly excreted in the urine as mercapturic acid derivatives of acrylamide and glycidamide .	
17258374-2	In a clinical study comprising of 53 subjects , the urinary excretion of these metabolites was determined using solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography with positive electrospray MS/MS detection .	1 12 127
17258374-3	The median ( range ) total excretion of acrylamide in urine during 24 h was 16 ( 7-47 ) microg acrylamide for non-smokers and 74 ( 38-106 ) microg acrylamide for smokers , respectively .	1 12 127
17258374-4	It was found that the median intake estimate in the study based on 24 h dietary recall was 21 ( 13-178 ) and 26 ( 12-67 ) for non-smokers and smokers , respectively .	24 2 243
17258374-5	The median dietary exposure to acrylamide was estimated to be 0.47 ( range 0.17-1.16 ) microg/kg body weight per day .	24 2 243
17258374-6	In a multiple linear regression analysis , the urinary excretion of acrylamide metabolites correlated statistically significant with intake of aspartic acid , protein , starch and coffee .	24 2 243
17258374-7	Consumption of citrus fruits correlated negatively with excretion of acrylamide metabolites .	24 2 243
17384769-0	BACKGROUND Only limited data exist on lactation as an exposure source of persistent perfluorinated chemicals ( PFCs ) for children .	
17384769-1	OBJECTIVES We studied occurrence and levels of PFCs in human milk in relation to maternal serum together with the temporal trend in milk levels between 1996 and 2004 in Sweden .	1 122 12 124
17384769-2	Matched , individual human milk and serum samples from 12 primiparous women in Sweden were analyzed together with composite milk samples ( 25-90 women/year ) from 1996 to 2004 .	1 122 12 124
17384769-3	RESULTS Eight PFCs were detected in the serum samples , and five of them were also above the detection limits in the milk samples .	1 122 12
17384769-4	Perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) were detected in all milk samples at mean concentrations of 0.201 ng/mL and 0.085 ng/mL , respectively .	
17384769-5	Perfluorooctanesulfonamide ( PFOSA ) , perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , and perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) were detected less frequently .	
17384769-6	DISCUSSION The total PFC concentration in maternal serum was 32 ng/mL , and the corresponding milk concentration was 0.34 ng/mL .	1 122 12 124
17384769-7	The PFOS milk level was on average 1% of the corresponding serum level .	1 122 12
17384769-8	There was a strong association between increasing serum concentration and increasing milk concentration for PFOS ( r(2) = 0.7 ) and PFHxS ( r(2) = 0.8 ) .	
17384769-9	PFOS and PFHxS levels in composite milk samples were relatively unchanged between 1996 and 2004 , with a total variation of 20 and 32% coefficient of variation , respectively .	1 12 124
17384769-10	CONCLUSION The calculated total amount of PFCs transferred by lactation to a breast-fed infant in this study was approximately 200 ng/day .	24 2 243
17384769-11	Lactation is a considerable source of exposure for infants , and reference concentrations for hazard assessments are needed .	24 2 243
20031315-0	Epidemiologic studies suggest that zinc ( Zn ) deficiency and high accumulation of cadmium ( Cd ) may be associated with increased risk of cancer .	
20031315-1	The incidence of mouth cancer has increased among females , who possess habits of chewing tobacco with gradients ( areca nut and betel quid ) and smoking tobacco in Pakistan .	
20031315-2	In present study , we measured the concentration of Cd and Zn in 96 mouth cancer patients ( MCPs ) and 110 female controls/referents ( 67 smoker and chewing tobacco ) , while 43 have none of smoking and chewing tobacco habits , belongs to different cities of Pakistan .	
20031315-3	Both controls and patients have same age group ( ranged 35-65 years ) , socio-economic status , localities and dietary habits .	
20031315-4	The Zn and Cd were determined by flame/graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer , prior to microwave assisted acid digestion method .	
20031315-5	The Cd/Zn ratio in both biological samples was also calculated .	
20031315-6	The results of this study showed that the mean value of Zn was lower , while the mean concentration of Cd was higher in the blood and scalp hair samples of MCPs as compared to control subjects ( p&lt;0.001 ) .	1 12 122 123
20031315-7	The controls chewing and smoking tobacco have high level of Cd in both biological samples as compared to those have not smoking or chewing tobacco ( p&lt;0.012 ) .	
20031315-8	The Cd/Zn ratio was higher in MCPs than control subjects .	
20031315-9	This study is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between cadmium , cigarette smoking , deficiency of Zn and cancer risk .	
20813654-0	BACKGROUND The long-term effects of arsenic exposure from drinking water at levels &lt ; 300 microg/L and the risk of diabetes mellitus remains a controversial topic .	
20813654-1	METHOD We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using baseline data from 11,319 participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study in Araihazar , Bangladesh , to evaluate the associations of well water arsenic and total urinary arsenic concentration and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and glucosuria .	11 24 12 1 11122 2 241 127 111 1112
20813654-2	We also assessed the concentrations of well water arsenic , total urinary arsenic , and urinary arsenic metabolites in relation to blood glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels in subsets of the study population .	11 24 1 2 111 11123 241 1112
20813654-3	RESULTS More than 90% of the cohort members were exposed to drinking water with arsenic concentration &lt ; 300 microg/L .	24 2 241
20813654-4	We found no association between arsenic exposure and the prevalence of diabetes .	
20813654-5	The adjusted odds ratios for diabetes were 1.00 ( referent ) , 1.35 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.90-2.02 ] , 1.24 ( 0.82-1.87 ) , 0.96 ( 0.62-1.49 ) , and 1.11 ( 0.73-1.69 ) in relation to quintiles of time-weighted water arsenic concentrations of 0.1-8 , 8-41 , 41-91 , 92-176 , and &gt ; or = 177 microg/L , respectively , and 1.00 ( referent ) , 1.29 ( 0.87-1.91 ) , 1.05 ( 0.69-1.59 ) , 0.94 ( 0.61-1.44 ) , and 0.93 ( 0.59-1.45 ) in relation to quintiles of urinary arsenic concentrations of 1-36 , 37-66 , 67-114 , 115-204 , and &gt ; or = 205 microg/L , respectively .	1 12 127
20813654-6	We observed no association between arsenic exposure and prevalence of glucosuria and no evidence of an association between well water arsenic , total urinary arsenic , or the composition of urinary arsenic metabolites and HbA1c level .	24 2 241
20813654-7	CONCLUSIONS Our findings do not support an association of arsenic exposure from drinking water and a significantly increased risk of diabetes mellitus in the range of levels observed .	24 2 241
20813654-8	Further prospective studies would be valuable in confirming the findings .	
17431496-0	BACKGROUND A concern persists that children's exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams produces neurotoxicity .	
17431496-1	OBJECTIVE Our goal was to compare the neuropsychological function of children , without prior exposure to dental amalgam , whose caries were repaired using either dental amalgam or mercury-free composite materials .	11 24 1 244 2 112
17431496-2	METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 534 6- to 10-year-old urban and rural children who were assessed yearly for 5 years using a battery of tests of intelligence , achievement , language , memory , learning , visual-spatial skills , verbal fluency , fine motor function , problem solving , attention , and executive function .	1 11 112
17431496-3	RESULTS Although the mean urinary mercury concentration was greater among children in the amalgam group than the composite group ( 0.9 vs. 0.6 microg/g creatinine ) , few significant differences were found between the test scores of children in the two groups .	24 12 1 244 2 127
17431496-4	The differences found were inconsistent in direction .	
17431496-5	Analyses using two cumulative exposure indices--surface years of amalgam and urinary mercury concentration--produced similar results .	
17431496-6	CONCLUSIONS Exposure to elemental mercury in amalgam at the levels experienced by the children who participated in the trial did not result in significant effects on neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period .	
20050842-0	Some studies have recently suggested that mercury ( Hg)-exposed populations face increased risks of cardiovascular diseases , and experimental data indicate that such risks might be due to reductions in nitric oxide bioavailability .	
20050842-1	However , no previous study has examined whether Hg exposure affects plasma nitrite concentrations in humans as an indication of nitric oxide production .	
20050842-2	Here , we investigated whether there is an association between circulating nitrite and Hg concentrations in whole blood , plasma and hair from an exposed methylmercury ( MeHg ) population .	11 12 11122 1 122 123 111 1112
20050842-3	Hair and blood samples were collected from 238 persons exposed to MeHg from fish consumption .	1 12 122 123
20050842-4	Hg concentrations in plasma ( PHg ) , whole blood ( BHg ) and hair Hg ( HHg ) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry .	1 12 122 123
20050842-5	Mean BHg content was 49.8 +/- 35.2 microg/l , mean PHg was 7.8 +/- 6.9 microg/l and HHg 14.6 +/- 10.6 microg/g .	
20050842-6	Mean plasma nitrite concentration was 253.2 +/- 105.5 nM .	11 1 11122 1112 111
20050842-7	No association was found between plasma nitrite concentration and BHg or HHg concentrations in a univariate model .	
20050842-8	However , multiple regression models adjusted for gender , age and fish consumption showed a significant association between plasma nitrite and plasma Hg concentration ( beta = -0.1 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
20050842-9	Our findings constitute preliminary clinical evidence that exposure to MeHg may cause inhibitory effects on the production of endothelial nitric oxide .	
21345762-0	BACKGROUND Human exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) remains widespread .	
21345762-1	PCBs have been associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes including reduced fecundability and increased risk of pregnancy loss , although the human data remain largely inconclusive .	
21345762-2	OBJECTIVE Our goal was to explore the relationship between serum PCB concentrations and early pregnancy loss among a large cohort of women undergoing in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) between 1994 and 2003 .	11 1 122 12 112
21345762-3	METHODS Concentrations of 57 PCB congeners were measured in serum samples collected during 827 IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles from 765 women .	1 122 12
21345762-4	Joint statistical models that accommodate multiple outcomes and multiple cycles per woman were used to assess the relationship between serum PCB quartiles and implantation failure , chemical pregnancies ( human chorionic gonadotropin level &gt ; 5.0 mIU/mL ) that did not result in clinical pregnancy , or spontaneous abortion , while also adjusting for confounders .	1 11 112
21345762-5	RESULTS PCB-153 was the congener present in the highest concentration ( median , 46.2 ng/g lipid ) .	
21345762-6	Increasing quartiles of PCB-153 and the sum of all measured PCB congeners ( Î£PCBs ) were associated with significantly elevated dose-dependent odds of failed implantation .	1 11 112
21345762-7	Adjusted odds ratios ( 95% confidence interval ) for highest versus lowest quartile were 2.0 ( 1.2-3.4 ) for PCB-153 and 1.7 ( 1.0-2.9 ) for Î£PCBs .	
21345762-8	There were suggestive trends for increased odds of implantation failure for PCB-118 and cytochrome P450-inducing congeners ( p-values for trend = 0.06 ) .	
21345762-9	No statistically significant associations between PCBs and chemical pregnancy or spontaneous abortion were found .	
21345762-10	CONCLUSIONS Serum PCB concentrations at levels similar to the U.S. general population were associated with failed implantation among women undergoing IVF .	
21345762-11	These findings may help explain previous reports of reduced fecundability among women exposed to PCBs .	
20056628-0	The evidence linking arsenic in drinking water with increased urinary cancer risk comes from populations in relatively high exposure areas ( &gt;100 microg/L ) , whereas studies from lower exposure areas ( &lt;100 microg/L ) reported inconsistent results .	
20056628-1	A previous study conducted in northeastern Taiwan , where residents were exposed to relatively lower concentrations , reported increased risk of urinary cancer in a dose-response way .	
20056628-2	Using the same cohort with longer follow-up , we conducted analysis to elucidate the relationship between ingested arsenic and urinary cancer in lower exposure groups and assessed the influence of duration , recency , and latency of drinking arsenic-containing well water .	24 2 241
20056628-3	A total of 8,086 residents from northeastern Taiwan were followed for 12 years .	
20056628-4	Incident urinary cancer was ascertained through linkage with the national cancer registry .	
20056628-5	All analysis was done by Cox proportional hazards regression models .	
20056628-6	There were 45 incidences of urinary cancer and a monotonic increased risk of urinary cancer was found with increasing arsenic concentration ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
20056628-7	For the highly exposed ( &gt;100 microg/L ) , the relative risks ( RR ) were &gt;5-fold , whereas the risk was elevated but not significant for low exposure ( &lt;100 microg/L ) .	
20056628-8	Relative to the arsenic concentration &lt;10 microg/L , those who drank well water with higher concentration from birth [ RR , 3.69 ; 95% confidence interval ( 95% CI ) , 1.31-10.4 ] , still drank at enrollment ( RR , 3.50 ; 95% CI , 1.33-9.22 ) , and drank for &gt;50 years ( RR , 4.12 ; 95% CI , 1.48-11.5 ) had a significantly increased risk of urinary cancer .	24 2 241
20056628-9	When restricted to urothelial carcinoma , all risk estimates including concentration and characteristics of well water consumption were higher .	
20084543-0	OBJECTIVE Arsenic in drinking water has been linked with the risk of urinary bladder cancer , but the dose-response relationships for arsenic exposures below 100 microg/L remain equivocal .	
20084543-1	We conducted a population-based case-control study in southeastern Michigan , USA , where approximately 230,000 people were exposed to arsenic concentrations between 10 and 100 microg/L .	
20084543-2	METHODS This study included 411 bladder cancer cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 , and 566 controls recruited during the same period .	
20084543-3	Individual lifetime exposure profiles were reconstructed , and residential water source histories , water consumption practices , and water arsenic measurements or modeled estimates were determined at all residences .	24 2 241
20084543-4	Arsenic exposure was estimated for 99% of participants ' person-years .	
20084543-5	RESULTS Overall , an increase in bladder cancer risk was not found for time-weighted average lifetime arsenic exposure &gt;10 microg/L when compared with a reference group exposed to &lt;1 microg/L ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.10 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.65 , 1.86 ) .	2
20084543-6	Among ever-smokers , risks from arsenic exposure &gt;10 microg/L were similarly not elevated when compared to the reference group ( OR = 0.94 ; 95% CI : 0.50 , 1.78 ) .	
20084543-7	CONCLUSIONS We did not find persuasive evidence of an association between low-level arsenic exposure and bladder cancer .	
20084543-8	Selecting the appropriate exposure metric needs to be thoughtfully considered when investigating risk from low-level arsenic exposure .	
21342690-0	Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases among children and adults .	
21342690-1	Although the risk factors for atopic dermatitis have not yet been fully identified , exposure to mercury may be an important environmental risk factor .	
21342690-2	The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between mercury body burden and prevalence of atopic dermatitis in an adult population .	
21342690-3	We recruited participants ( n=1990 ) aged 20 years or older , using stratified random sampling of Korean census blocks .	
21342690-4	Demographic characteristics and medical history of atopic dermatitis were collected from participants by questionnaire , and mercury levels were determined by an analysis of blood samples .	1 122 12
21342690-5	We found that demographic factors such as sex , age , alcohol drinking status , income , and fish or shellfish consumption were important covariates determining blood mercury concentration .	24 12 1 122 2 243
21342690-6	Sex and cigarette smoking status were important demographic variables affecting the prevalence of atopic dermatitis .	
21342690-7	After adjusting for demographic factors , blood mercury concentrations were positively associated with lifetime prevalence of atopic dermatitis [ odds ratio ( OR ) , highest vs. lowest tertile=1.50 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.02-2.21 ; p for trend=0.057 ] .	1 122 12
21342690-8	This association became stronger for 1-year prevalence of atopic dermatitis ( OR , highest vs. lowest tertile=1.82 ; 95% CI , 1.17-2.83 ; p for trend=0.026 ) .	
21342690-9	Mercury body burden and atopic dermatitis prevalence vary across demographic characteristics , and increased blood level of mercury was related to an incidence of atopic dermatitis in this adult population .	1 122 12
12550085-0	The well water in Lanyang Basin , which is located in the northeastern portion of Taiwan island , was found to have high levels of arsenic ranging from undetectable levels ( &lt;0.15 ppb ) to 3.59 ppm .	
12550085-1	We performed a study to compare the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes ( preterm delivery and birthweight ) between an area with historic high well water arsenic levels ( arsenic-exposed area ( AE) ) and a comparison area with no historic evidence of arsenic water contamination ( non-arsenic-exposed area ( NAE) ) .	11 1 112
12550085-2	The mean birth weight in the AEs and NAEs were 3132.6 and 3162.6 g , respectively .	
12550085-3	Babies born in AEs were on average 30 g lighter than those born in NAEs .	
12550085-4	AEs had a higher rate of preterm delivery than NAEs ( 3.74% vs 3.43% ) .	
12550085-5	The results of this study suggest that , after adjustment for potential confounders , arsenic exposure from drinking well water was associated , although not significantly , with the risk of preterm delivery , with an odds ratio of 1.10 ( 0.91-1.33 ) .	24 2 241
12550085-6	The estimated reduction in birth weight was 29.05 g ( 95% CI=13.55-44.55 ) .	
12550085-7	The findings from this investigation provide evidence for a potential role for arsenic exposure through drinking water in increasing the risk of low birthweight .	
20085960-0	There is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between zinc ( Zn ) deficiency and high accumulation of cadmium ( Cd ) in biological samples of different cancerous patients .	
20085960-1	The incidence of mouth cancer has been increased among people who possess habit of drinking alcohol , tobacco smoking and chewing with gradients in Pakistan .	
20085960-2	In the present study , Cd and Zn contents of blood and scalp hair samples of 92 male mouth cancer patients and 78 referents of same age group ( range 35-65 years ) , socio-economic status , localities and dietary habits .	1 12 122 123
20085960-3	Among referent male subjects , 56 consumed tobacco ( smoking/chewing ) , 22 had none of smoking and chewing tobacco habits , while none of them admitted for alcohol drinking .	
20085960-4	The scalp hair and whole blood samples were oxidized by 65% nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide ( 2:1 ) ratio in microwave oven .	1 12 122 123
20085960-5	The Zn in digests was determined by flame atomic absorption while Cd was determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry .	
20085960-6	The average Cd concentration was higher , while level of Zn was lower in the blood and scalp hair samples of mouth cancer patients as compared to referent subjects ( p &lt ; .001 ) .	1 12 122 123
20085960-7	The male referents consuming tobacco ( chewing and smoking ) have high level of Cd in both their biological samples as compared to those not smoking or chewing tobacco ( p &lt ; .012 ) .	
20085960-8	The Cd/Zn ratio in both biological samples was found to be higher in patients than in referent subjects .	
20646740-0	A considerable amount of work has been conducted developing exposure estimate models for quantitative evaluation of mercury ( Hg ) intake and human health risks , but few have assessed the applicability and the validity for evaluating the risks posed by Hg in the environment and have achieved very mixed results .	
20646740-1	The present study focused on verifying estimated daily Hg intake using exposure equations with either the deterministic or probabilistic ( the Monte Carlo ) approaches .	2
20646740-2	The simulated daily Hg intake doses were compared with those established from measured Hg concentrations in the hair of 289 participants .	1 12 123 2
20646740-3	The results showed that the single-value deterministic method for simulating Hg exposure levels overestimated the level of risk by a factor of 1.5 when compared with the highest concentration of Hg observed in the hair of the study population .	1 123 12
20646740-4	Contrarily , the average daily Hg intake doses simulated using the probabilistic simulation were similar in distribution to the biomarker data .	2
20646740-5	When the reference dose ( RfD ) of 0.1 microg/kg body weight/day was adopted as the acceptable dose for daily intake rate , there were approximately 19 percent estimated to have potential Hg exposure risks based on the Monte Carlo simulation .	
20646740-6	This percentage was favourably similar to the 17 percent determined from Hg concentrations in the hair samples .	1 123 12
20646740-7	The difference between the probabilistic simulation and the data derived from hair Hg levels was considered mainly due to the uncertainties in unconfirmed questionnaire-based survey data , small sampling sizes and the surrogates used in the exposure models .	
20646740-8	The findings implied that the existing exposure models together with the probabilistic approach were appropriate for research of human exposure to Hg .	
20646734-0	UNLABELLED Long term exposure to arsenic can cause adverse health effects and lead to different levels of disability .	
20646734-1	The prevalence of arsenical dermatosis is as high as 40% in the Hetao Plain area of Inner Mongolia , but the association between exposure to arsenic in drinking water and the occurrence of disability has not yet been fully examined .	24 2 241
20646734-2	The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of disability in arsenic-affected villages in Inner Mongolia , China .	
20646734-3	METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed to examine the prevalence of disability .	
20646734-4	A total of 320 villagers in the age range of 20-39 years were interviewed and examined for disability and arsenical skin lesions .	
20646734-5	The subjects were classified into a high arsenic group ( 50 microg L(-1) ) and a low arsenic group ( &lt;50 microg L(-1) ) .	
20646734-6	The relationship between levels of arsenic in drinking water and disability was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals .	24 2 241
20646734-7	RESULTS The prevalence of disability was 6.88% in the arsenic affected area of Inner Mongolia and 24.72% in the arsenic group 50 microg L(-1) .	
20646734-8	A strong correlation was found between disability and arsenical skin lesions ( OR=86.39 , 95%CI : 25.45-293.20 ) .	
20646734-9	CONCLUSION This suggests that the level of arsenic exposure is a major risk factor for disability .	
20646734-10	Further research is needed to place the results in a wider context and to determine the exact relationship between arsenic exposure and disability .	
12573902-0	Increases in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( NHL ) incidence and mortality rates during the past few decades remain largely unexplained .	
12573902-1	Studies suggest that organochlorine pesticides may contribute to an increased risk of NHL .	
12573902-2	In 1974 , serum samples were obtained from 25,802 participants in the Campaign Against Cancer and Stroke in Washington County , Maryland ( USA ) , and cryopreserved for future study .	1 122 12
12573902-3	We measured prediagnostic levels of chlordane , lindane ( gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane ) , beta-hexachlorocyclohexane , transnonachlor , heptachlor , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane , dieldrin , and hexachlorobenzene in serum samples of 74 cases of NHL and 147 matched controls .	
12573902-4	Previously , we found an association between NHL and serum levels of total PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) , but not DDT ( dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ) and related compounds .	1 122 12
12573902-5	In this instance , there was no evidence of an association between NHL risk and serum levels of any of the individual lipid- and recovery-corrected organochlorines that we evaluated , nor of the summed chlordane-related compounds ( transnonachlor , heptachlor , heptachlor epoxide , oxychlordane ) .	
12573902-6	These findings do not support the hypothesis that the organochlorine compounds included in this study are strongly linked to the development of NHL .	
12573902-7	The possibility of a weak association cannot be excluded by these data .	
20643475-0	BACKGROUND Persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) are lipophilic chemicals that bioaccumulate .	
20643475-1	Most of them were resticted or banned in the 1970s and 1980s to protect human health and the environment .	
20643475-2	The main source for humans is dietary intake of dairy products , meat and fish .	
20643475-3	Little data exist on changes of the concentration of POPs in the Swedish population over time .	
20643475-4	OBJECTIVE To study if the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , DDE , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and chlordanes have changed in the Swedish population during 1993-2007 , and certain factors that may influence the concentrations .	
20643475-5	METHODS During 1993-2007 samples from 537 controls in different human cancer studies were collected and analysed .	
20643475-6	Background information such as body mass index , breast-feeding and parity was assessed by questionaires .	
20643475-7	Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to analyse the explanatory factors specimen ( blood or adipose tissue ) , gender , BMI , total breast-feeding and parity in relation to POPs .	1 121 122 12
20643475-8	Time trends for POPs were analysed using linear regression analysis , adjusted for specimen , gender , BMI and age .	
20643475-9	RESULTS The concentration decreased for all POPs during 1993-2007 .	
20643475-10	The annual change was statistically significant for the sum of PCBs -7.2% , HCB -8.8% , DDE -13.5% and the sum of chlordanes -10.3% .	
20643475-11	BMI and age were determinants of the concentrations .	
20643475-12	Cumulative breast-feeding &gt;8 months gave statistically significantly lower concentrations for the sum of PCBs , DDE and the sum of chlordanes .	
20643475-13	Parity with &gt;2 children yielded statistically significantly lower sum of PCBs .	
20643475-14	CONCLUSIONS All the studied POPs decreased during the time period , probably due to restrictions of their use .	
12573904-0	Surface soil and groundwater in Australia have been found to contain high concentrations of arsenic .	
12573904-1	The relative importance of long-term human exposure to these sources has not been established .	
12573904-2	Several studies have investigated long-term exposure to environmental arsenic concentrations using hair and toenails as the measure of exposure .	1 123 12
12573904-3	Few have compared the difference in these measures of environmental sources of exposure .	
12573904-4	In this study we aimed to investigate risk factors for elevated hair and toenail arsenic concentrations in populations exposed to a range of environmental arsenic concentrations in both drinking water and soil as well as in a control population with low arsenic concentrations in both drinking water and soil .	1 123 12
12573904-5	In this study , we recruited 153 participants from areas with elevated arsenic concentrations in drinking water and residential soil , as well as a control population with no anticipated arsenic exposures .	24 245 2 241
12573904-6	The median drinking water arsenic concentrations in the exposed population were 43.8 micro g/L ( range , 16.0-73 micro g/L ) and median soil arsenic concentrations were 92.0 mg/kg ( range , 9.1-9,900 mg/kg ) .	245 24 2 241
12573904-7	In the control group , the median drinking water arsenic concentration was below the limit of detection , and the median soil arsenic concentration was 3.3 mg/kg .	
12573904-8	Participants were categorized based on household drinking water and residential soil arsenic concentrations .	245 24 2 241
12573904-9	The geometric mean hair arsenic concentrations were 5.52 mg/kg for the drinking water exposure group and 3.31 mg/kg for the soil exposure group .	24 245 12 1 123 241 2
12573904-10	The geometric mean toenail arsenic concentrations were 21.7 mg/kg for the drinking water exposure group and 32.1 mg/kg for the high-soil exposure group .	
12573904-11	Toenail arsenic concentrations were more strongly correlated with both drinking water and soil arsenic concentrations ; however , there is a strong likelihood of significant external contamination .	1 123 12
12573904-12	Measures of residential exposure were better predictors of hair and toenail arsenic concentrations than were local environmental concentrations .	
20145889-0	Mercury is a persistent heavy metal that has been associated with damage to the central nervous system , including hearing and speech impairment , visual constriction and loss of muscle control .	
20145889-1	In aquatic environments mercury may be methylated to its most toxic form , methyl-mercury .	
20145889-2	In 1990 concerns were raised over mercury contamination in the vicinity of a mercury processing plant in KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa .	
20145889-3	Mercury waste was reported to have been discharged into the Mngceweni River , situated in close proximity to the plant .	
20145889-4	The Mngceweni River joins the uMgeni River , which in turn flows into the Inanda Dam , along the banks of which several villages are located .	
20145889-5	This study evaluated the mercury levels in river and dam sediments , fish from the Inanda Dam and hair samples collected from residents of three villages along the banks of the Inanda Dam .	1 123 12
20145889-6	The study results showed that 50% of the fish samples and 17% of hair samples collected from villagers had mercury concentrations that exceeded guideline levels of the World Health Organization .	1 123 12
20145889-7	Mercury concentrations in 62% of the river sediment samples collected in close proximity to the former mercury processing plant exceeded the level at which remedial action is required according to legislation in the Netherlands .	
20145889-8	These preliminary findings give reasons for concern and should be used as a baseline for further investigations .	
12584006-0	Nine hundred eight women aged 40-88 years living in a non-Cd-polluted area in Japan were analyzed for urinary cadmium ( Cd ) , N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) activity , beta(2)-microglobulin ( B2MG ) concentration , and for the stiffness index ( STIFF ) of calcaneal bone using an ultrasound method .	11 12 127 1 11123 111 112 1112
12584006-1	The urinary Cd in the subjects , with a mean and range of 2.87 and 0.25-11.4 microg/g creatinine , respectively , showed a significant correlation with NAG but not with B2MG .	
12584006-2	STIFF was significantly inversely correlated with urinary Cd , and the association remained significant after adjusting for age , body weight , and menstrual status , suggesting a significant effect of Cd on the bone loss in these subjects without signs of Cd-induced kidney damage .	1 12 127
12584006-3	A two-fold increase in urinary Cd was accompanied by a decrease in STIFF corresponding to a 1.7-year rise in age .	
12584006-4	These results emphasize the need for reassessment of the significance of Cd exposure in the general Japanese population .	
20198362-0	The purpose of this study was to clarify the change and relationship of urinary cadmium ( Cd ) and beta(2)-microglobulin ( beta(2)-MG ) concentrations of inhabitants in Cd-polluted areas after soil restoration .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
20198362-1	The urinary Cd and beta(2)-MG concentrations of 25 males and 28 females did not show a significant change , 22 years after the Cd-polluted soil was restored .	1 12 127
20198362-2	Once exposed to Cd , it was found to remain in the body , 22 years after the Cd -polluted soil was restored .	
20198362-3	However , this did not influence renal tubular dysfunction in most of the younger generation compared with elders heavily exposed to Cd .	
21310402-0	Diet and endocrine disrupting persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) have been associated with gynecologic conditions including uterine leiomyomata ( UL ) , endometriosis , and ovarian cysts .	
21310402-1	Great Lakes sport fish consumption is a source of exposure to POPs such as p,p'-diphenyldichloroethene ( DDE ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .	
21310402-2	This study was designed to examine retrospectively the effects Great Lakes sport fish consumption on the incidence of UL and to examine the effects of DDE and PCB serum levels on prevalent UL in women participating in the Great Lakes Fish Consumption Study .	24 12 1 122 2 243
21310402-3	We hypothesized that associations of exposures with UL would be modified by breastfeeding status .	
21310402-4	Years of sport fish consumption , demographic , health , and reproductive data were assessed by survey .	24 2 243
21310402-5	In a subgroup , serum was collected and tested for DDE and PCB levels .	1 122 12
21310402-6	Effects of years of Great Lakes sport fish and sport fish consumption were modeled using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression and effects of POP exposures on UL were modeled using multiple logistic regression .	24 2 243
21310402-7	Years of sport fish consumption were associated with UL , with an incidence rate ratio of 1.2 ( 95% CI 1.0-1.3 ) for each 10-year increment of fish consumption .	24 2 243
21310402-8	Summary measures of POP exposures in the overall group were not associated with UL .	
21310402-9	In the subgroup of women who never breastfed and in whom PCB measurements were available , however , UL was significantly associated with PCBs and groupings of estrogenic , antiestrogenic , and dioxin-like PCBs .	
21310402-10	These findings support the possibility that PCB exposures from fish consumption may increase the risk of UL and highlight the importance of additional studies exploring biologic pathways by which they could be acting .	24 2 243
21300142-0	The identification of reliable biomarkers is critical for the assessment of occupational exposure of benzene : S-phenylmercapturic acid ( SPMA ) and trans,trans-muconic acid ( t,t-MA ) are the most currently used. t,t-MA is an open-ring metabolite , but it is also a metabolite of the food preservative sorbic acid , while SPMA is formed by conjugation with glutathione , and several studies suggested that the genetic polymorphism of glutathione S-transferases modulates its production .	
21300142-1	This study compared the ability of these metabolites to assess the benzene exposure in a big group of petrochemical workers .	1 12 127
21300142-2	Furthermore , investigated how genetic polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase theta 1 ( GSTT1 ) , glutathione S-transferase mu 1 ( GSTM1 ) , glutathione S-transferase pi 1 ( GSTP1 ) and smoking habits , may influence their excretion .	
21300142-3	Results showed that occupational exposure to benzene was negligible compared to that from smoking and confirmed the modulating effect of the genetic polymorphism of GSTT1 on the urinary excretion of SPMA , but not of t , t-MA , even at very low levels of benzene exposure .	1 12 127
21300142-4	The same effect was found for GSTM1 , but only for smokers .	
21300142-5	The t,t-MA/SPMA ratio was not a constant value and resulted to be higher than the corresponding Biological Exposure Index ( BEI ) ratio , which is currently equal to 20 .	
21300142-6	Higher values of metabolite have been associated with the GSTT1 or GSTM1 null genotype and these are responsible for increase health risk .	
21300142-7	We suggest that this ratio could be used as a marker of individual susceptibility for subjects with benzene exposure .	
20576543-0	Worldwide , approximately 30-50 millions of people are living in small scale gold mining areas and are primarily burdened by mercury vapour .	
20576543-1	In the frame of our study , 306 mercury ( Hg ) vapour burdened adults , working and/ or living in two small scale gold mining areas in Zimbabwe and Tanzania and 58 volunteers from near-by unburdened communities were medically investigated .	
20576543-2	In addition , blood , urine and hair samples from each participant were analyzed for mercury .	1 122 12 127 123
20576543-3	Altogether , 26 anamnestic and 24 clinical signs and symptoms , which may be caused by Hg vapour , were evaluated .	
20576543-4	Multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the influence of the mercury concentration in the bio-monitors on the evaluated anamnestic and clinical signs and symptoms taking into account age , gender , health status , alcohol consumption , use of pesticides and gasoline sniffing .	
20576543-5	Out of the resulting correlations between concentration and effect , ROC-curves were calculated to determine best estimates of the cut-off-values in the bio monitors .	
20576543-6	For the parameters ataxia of gait and sadness cut-off-values of 4.7 and 3.6 microg Hg/g crea in urine were calculated .	11 1 127 12 112
20576543-7	These values were converted to a rounded LOAEL of 3.5 microg Hg vapour/m(3) air .	
20576543-8	In analogy to the US EPA Report ( U.S .	
20576543-9	Environmental Protection Agency 1997 ) and the European Position Paper ( Pirrone et al. 2001 ) , uncertainty factors of 30 and 50 were applied , resulting in a proposed reference concentration ( RfC ) in ambient air of 0.1 microg Hg vapour/m(3) and 0.07 microg Hg vapour/m(3) , respectively .	
12611665-0	We studied associations between lifestyle/medical factors and lipid-adjusted serum concentrations of seven polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congeners and five chlorinated pesticides/metabolites among 205 Swedish women ( 54-75 years old ) .	1 122 12
12611665-1	Serum concentrations were significantly associated with age , body mass index , body weight change , diabetes mellitus , consumption of fatty fish , and place of residence .	24 12 1 122 2 243
12611665-2	The findings suggest that lifestyle/medical factors may confound results in epidemiologic studies when they are related to both serum concentrations and disease .	
12611665-3	Moreover , disease itself may influence serum concentrations of some organochlorines , as indicated by the negative associations between recent weight change and serum concentrations of some PCB congeners , p,p -dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE ) , and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and the positive association between diabetes mellitus and HCB concentrations .	
12611665-4	Age was the only determinant that showed a consistent association with all compounds studied ( positive ) ; otherwise associations with single determinants varied among compounds even within the PCB group .	
12611665-5	This shows that the studied organochlorines should not be treated as a homogeneous group of compounds in epidemiologic studies .	
12615108-0	A method for trace analysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDE ) in fish based on gas chromatography/electron ionization high resolution mass spectrometry ( GC/EI-HRMS ) was developed , and levels of PBDE were determined in whitefish ( Coregonus sp. ) from eight Swiss lakes and in rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) from four Swiss fish farms .	
12615108-1	PBDE concentrations ( sum of PBDE congeners BDE-28 , BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , BDE-154 , and BDE-183 ) in filet from whitefish between 36 and 165 ng/g lipid weight ( lw ) were found , corresponding to wet weight ( ww ) concentrations of 1.6-7.4 ng/gww .	
12615108-2	PBDE contents in filet from farmed rainbow trout were significantly lower than in wild whitefish ( 12-24 ng/glw , 0.74-1.3 ng/gww ) , and the PBDE congener patterns were different for both species ( a higher BDE-47 to BDE-99 ratio for farmed rainbow trout compared to wild whitefish was found ) .	
12615108-3	Whitefish PBDE levels [ ng/glw ] correlate better with the surface/volume ratio of the respective lakes ( r(2)=0.70 ) than with other lake properties such as catchment area ( size or number of inhabitants ) or residence time , suggesting atmospheric deposition as an input pathway for PBDE .	
12615108-4	Based on an average daily consumption of 20 g whitefish ( Switzerland ) with a PBDE content of 7.4 ng/gww ( highest PBDE concentration detected in this study ) , a maximum daily intake of 0.15 microg PBDE was estimated ( 0.026 microg/day for farmed trout ) .	24 2 243
12615108-5	This number corresponds to the lower end of the estimate for the total PBDE intake of the Nordic consumer of 0.2-0.7 microg/day .	
20300869-0	BACKGROUND , AIM AND SCOPE This study is the first to investigate PBDE body burden with regard to the concurrent analyses of multiple human matrices , namely milk , placenta , and hair , collected from a group of childbearing-aged women at an electronic waste ( e-waste ) recycling site to determine the partitioning of PBDEs in these different human matrices and the possible health risks imposed to infants at the e-waste recycling site .	1 123 12 124 126
20300869-1	METHODS AND METHODS Five sets of milk , placenta , and hair samples were collected from an e-waste site ( Taizhou , Zhejiang Province ) and a reference site ( Lin'an city , Zhejiang Province ; 245 km away from Taizhou ) in China .	1 123 12 124 126
20300869-2	The concentrations of total PBDEs in different human tissues were analyzed according to US EPA standard methods .	
20300869-3	RESULTS PBDE body burdens of women from the e-waste site ( milk 117 +/- 191 , 8.89-457 ng/g fat , placenta 19.5 +/- 29.9 , 1.28-72.1 ng/g fat , hair 110 +/- 210 , 8.47-486 ng/g dry wt. ) showed significantly higher levels than those from the reference site ( milk 2.06 +/- 0.94 , 1.0-3.56 ng/g fat , placenta 1.02 +/- 0.36 , 0.59-1.42 ng/g fat , hair 3.57 +/- 2.03 , 1.56-5.61 ng/g dry wt. ) and were higher than those reported in other studies , due to e-waste recycling operations , especially open burning .	
20300869-4	On a dry-weight basis , the following trend was found for PBDE among the samples from Taizhou : hair&gt;milk&gt;placenta .	
20300869-5	Among the donors , the body burden of an e-waste worker ranked second .	
20300869-6	Higher brominated BDEs ( hepta-BDEs ) contributed a significantly greater proportion to total PBDEs in hair of the Taizhou women ( 20% ) than that in milk ( 2.9% ) and in placenta ( 2.6% ) .	1 123 12 124 126
20300869-7	The estimated intake of PBDEs of 6-month-old breastfed infants living at the e-waste site was 572 +/- 839 ng/kg body wt/day , which was 57 times higher than that of infants from the reference site ( 10.1 +/- 4.60 ng/kg body wt/day ) .	24 2 243
20300869-8	Moreover , the maximum calculated value ( 2,240 ng/kg body wt/day ) exceeded the chronic oral reference dose for penta-BDE ( 2,000 ng/kg/day ) of US EPA .	
20300869-9	DISCUSSION BDE-47 was the dominant congener accounting for 20-30% in all the individual samples , while higher-brominated congeners , for example , BDE-183 and BDE-190 , contributed between 2% and 20% .	
20300869-10	The presence of hepta-BDE congeners ( BDE-181 , BDE-190 ) in hair of the women in Taizhou suggest that thermal degradation of Deca-BDE from the open burning of e-waste may have been their source because these congeners are not found in either Penta-BDE or Octa-BDE technical products .	1 123 12
20300869-11	Of the three types of samples analyzed , it was also suspected that hair may be more favorable to higher-brominated compounds which might explain why the hair samples contained the highest total PBDE concentrations and the highest proportion of higher-brominated BDEs ( hepta-BDEs ) .	1 123 12
20300869-12	CONCLUSION This study provides evidence that primitive e-waste recycling in China leads to high PBDE body burdens in local residents and can potentially threaten the health of infants .	
20300869-13	RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES Control measures should be imposed to minimize the level of pollutants resulting from e-waste processing operations to the environment and to humans .	
20300869-14	In-depth investigations on epidemiological studies of health impacts caused by e-waste recycling operations should be conducted .	
20300869-15	It is recommended that further measurements of PBDE levels in local food ( e.g. , fish , shellfish , dairy products , meat , fruits , and vegetables ) , dust , air , water , and human specimens be collected from a larger sample size at the e-waste processing site for the determination of human exposure pathways to PBDEs .	
20509646-0	Hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( OH-PBDEs ) are suspected endocrine disruptors , which can pass through the mammalian placenta and accumulate in the human maternal-fetal-placental unit .	
20509646-1	However , little is known about mechanisms of placental transfer and the associated risk(s) .	
20509646-2	Ten OH-PBDE congeners , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , total 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , and total thyroxine ( T4 ) were quantified in blood serum from 26 pregnant women and 28 matching fetuses , including three pairs of twins from South Korea .	11 12 11122 1 11121 122 1112 111
20509646-3	Only 6-OH-BDE-47 , a naturally occurring OH-PBDE , was detected at relatively great concentrations ( maternal serum : 17.5 +/- 26.3 pg/g ww , fetal cord blood serum : 30.2 +/- 27.1 pg/g ww ) , which suggests that exposure was related to diets among Korean women .	1 122 12
20509646-4	Concentrations of 6-OH-BDE-47 in maternal and cord serum were positively correlated , with concentrations being significantly greater in cord blood serum .	
20509646-5	The placental transfer ratio between fetal and maternal blood serum for 6-OH-BDE-47 ( F/M ratio : 1.4 +/- 1.1 ) was different than the observed placental transfer ratio of BPA and previously reported values for hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls ( OH-PCBs ) .	1 122 12
20509646-6	This result is possibly due to large affinities to T4 transport proteins .	
20509646-7	Lesser concentrations of E2 and T4 were detected in cord blood serum ( E2 : 4.7 +/- 2.2 ng/mL , T4 : 8.5 +/- 1.7 microg/dL ) compared to maternal blood serum ( E2 : 8.0 +/- 3.0 ng/mL , T4 : 9.7 +/- 1.8 microg/dL ) .	1 122 12
20509646-8	A major effect of OH-PBDE exposure might be a decrease in serum T4 concentrations .	
20509646-9	Potential risks associated with disruption of T4 transport to the developing fetus such as negative consequences for fetal neurological development should be considered in further studies .	
20494616-0	Because crude oil and refined petroleum products can contain benzene and benzene is considered a known carcinogen by numerous independent and governmental agencies , including the International Agency for Cancer Research , the petroleum industry has implemented exposure control programs for decades .	
20494616-1	As part of the benzene control programs , significant exposure assessments have been performed ; both qualitatively and through quantitative measurements .	
20494616-2	In this study , we evaluated the airborne concentrations of benzene and their variability over time at the ExxonMobil refinery in Beaumont , TX between 1976 and 2007 .	
20494616-3	The results of 5854 personal air samples are included in this analysis ; 3761 were considered non-task ( &gt ; or =180 min ) personal samples , and 2093 were considered task-related ( &lt;180 min ) personal samples .	2 233 23
20494616-4	Dock and loading rack samples were analyzed separately from the refinery samples because in addition to refinery products , employees at the dock and loading rack also handled chemical plant products .	
20494616-5	In general , the non-task personal refinery air samples indicated that exposures of the past 30 years were generally below the occupational exposure limit of 1 ppm ( mean=0.30 ppm , SD=3.1 ) , were higher during routine ( mean=0.32 ppm , SD=3.3 ) than turnaround operations ( mean=0.16 ppm , SD=0.87 ) , and decreased slightly over time .	23 2 233
20494616-6	The job sampled most frequently during routine operations was that of process technician , and , as broken down by area , resulted in the following mean benzene air concentrations : coker ( n=146 , mean=0.014 ppm , SD=0.036 ) , lube extraction unit ( n=31 , mean&lt;0.070 ppm ) , pipestills ( n=136 , mean=0.12 , SD=0.47 ) , waste treatment ( n=107 , mean=0.20 , SD=0.28 ) , and all other areas ( n=1115 , mean=0.059 ppm , SD=0.36 ) .	
20494616-7	Task-based samples indicated that the highest exposures resulted from the tank cleaning tasks , although the overall task mean benzene air concentration was 1.4 ppm during routine operations .	
20494616-8	The most frequently sampled task during routine operations was blinding and breaking , and the mean benzene air concentrations associated with this task were statistically higher in the reformer area of the refinery ( n=311 , mean=3.2 ppm , SD=7.9 ) than in all other areas ( n=200 , mean=0.92 ppm , SD=3.1 ) .	
20494616-9	However , task-related exposures were found to be statistically similar across job categories for a given task .	
20494616-10	This study thus provides a task-focused analysis for occupational exposure to benzene during refinery operations , and will be useful for understanding exposures at this refinery .	
12621899-0	The German Environmental Survey ( GerES ) is a cross-sectional probability study to determine the exposure of the general population to environmental contaminants .	
12621899-1	The study was repeated for the third time in 1998 ( GerES III ) .	
12621899-2	Again , a stratified random procedure was used to select the study population taking into account the parameters gender , age , community size and place of residence ( West- or East-Germany ) .	
12621899-3	A total of 4822 persons between 18 and 69 years of age from 120 localities participated in GerES III .	
12621899-4	Human biomonitoring comprised the determination of arsenic , cadmium , mercury , metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) , pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) , other chlorophenols , precious metals ( gold , platinum , iridium ) , nicotine , and cotinine in urine .	1 12 127
20329535-0	Twenty-four indoor and fifteen outdoor dust samples were collected from an electronic waste ( e-waste ) area , South China in October 2006 and October 2007 and analyzed for seventeen PBDE congeners .	
20329535-1	PBDEs were detected in all dust samples .	24 2 242
20329535-2	The total PBDE concentrations for indoor dusts ranged from 230-157500 ng/g , with a mean value of 9 400 ng/g , and 212-25 880 ng/g , with a mean value of 3 311 ng/g for outdoor samples , respectively .	24 2 242
20329535-3	The PBDE concentrations in the present study were at the high end of the worldwide figures .	
20329535-4	BDE209 was the predominant congener .	
20329535-5	Comparison of the PBDE congener patterns in dusts and technical products suggests that the relatively high abundances of octa- to nona-PBDE congeners in the dusts might be originated from the degradation of BDE209 .	
20329535-6	The average exposure estimates of PBDEs via dusts are 470 , 329 and 188 ng/d for infants , toddlers and adults , respectively .	24 2 242
20329535-7	The highest exposure estimates for infants and toddlers ( 31 500 and 19 700 ng/d ) were 4 and 2.5 fold higher than those for adults .	2
20329535-8	These results indicate that dust may be a very important route of exposure for PBDEs in local residents .	
20488749-0	Residents in Arnsberg , Germany , had been supplied by drinking water contaminated with perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) .	
20488749-1	Biomonitoring data from 2006 evidenced that plasma PFOA concentrations of residents from Arnsberg were 4.5-8.3 times higher than those in reference groups .	
20488749-2	The introduction of charcoal filtration in July 2006 distinctly reduced PFOA concentrations in drinking water .	
20488749-3	Our one-year follow-up study showed a 10-20% reduction of PFOA plasma levels in residents from Arnsberg .	
20488749-4	Here we report the first results of the two-year follow-up study Arnsberg 2008 .	
20488749-5	Additionally , the results of the two-year follow-up examination of the reference group are included .	
20488749-6	Paired plasma samples of 138 study participants ( 45 children , 46 mothers and 47 men ) collected in 2006 and 2008 were considered in the statistical analyses .	1 122 12
20488749-7	Within the two years plasma concentrations of PFOA , perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) decreased in residents from Arnsberg and in control groups .	1 122 12
20488749-8	The geometric means of PFOA plasma levels declined by 39% ( children and mothers ) and 26% ( men ) in Arnsberg and by 13-15% in the corresponding subgroups from the reference areas .	1 122 12
20488749-9	For the population from Arnsberg a geometric mean plasma PFOA half-life of 3.26 years ( range 1.03-14.67 years ) was calculated .	1 122 12
20488749-10	Our results confirm an ongoing reduction of the PFOA load in residents from Arnsberg .	
20488749-11	The decline of PFC levels in plasma of participants from the reference areas reflects the general decrease of human PFC exposure during the very recent years .	1 122 12
20397419-0	Follow-up investigation on hair arsenic concentration was conducted in an arsenic heavily polluted area of southern China in 2002 and 2006 .	
20397419-1	The results showed that the geometric mean of hair arsenic concentration decreased from 2.95 mg/kg in 2002 to 1.78 mg/kg in 2006 , when the percentage of the population with levels over 1 mg/kg only decreased from 93.4% in 2002 to 80.5% in 2006 .	1 123 12
20397419-2	Over this four-year period , the population with high arsenic concentrations decreased significantly while there was no obvious change in hair arsenic concentration for people who had relatively low concentrations .	1 123 12
20397419-3	In terms of age distribution , young and old people had higher hair arsenic concentrations than the middle-aged .	1 123 12
20397419-4	All of these results showed that it is difficult to reverse the negative impact of arsenic pollution on human health .	
20397419-5	Arsenic pollution has a long-term continuous influence on the health of local residents .	
20401490-0	OBJECTIVE Methods and results are presented for an arsenic exposure assessment integral to an epidemiological case-control study of arsenic and cancer-the European Commission funded ASHRAM ( Arsenic Health Risk Assessment and Molecular Epidemiology ) study carried out in some counties of Hungary , Romania and Slovakia .	
20401490-1	METHODS The exposure history of each participant ( N = 1,392 ) was constructed by taking into account how much water they consumed ( as water , in drinks and in food ) , sources of drinking water in their various residences over their lifetime , and the concentrations of arsenic in their various water supplies measured by Hydride Generation-Atomic Absorption Spectrometry ( HG-AAS ) .	24 2 241
20401490-2	Concentrations of arsenic in previous water supplies were either derived from contemporary analyses of the same source , or from routine historical data from measurements performed by the authorities in each country .	
20401490-3	Using this approach , 80% of the recorded lifetime residential history was matched to an arsenic concentration .	
20401490-4	Seven indices of current , life time , and peak exposure were calculated .	2
20401490-5	RESULTS The exposure indices were all log-normally distributed and the mean and median lifetime average concentrations were in Hungary 14.7 and 13.3 microg l(-1) , Romania 3.8 and 0.7 microg l(-1) and in Slovakia 1.9 and 0.8 microg l(-1) , respectively .	
20401490-6	Overall 25% of the population had average concentrations over 10 microg l(-1) and 8% with exposure over 50 microg l(-1) .	
20401490-7	CONCLUSIONS Careful assessment of arsenic in drinking water supplies ( both current and previous ) enabled the majority of study participants ' cumulative lifetime of potential exposure to arsenic in residential water to be characterised .	24 2 241
21272865-0	Excessive urinary calcium excretion is the major risk of urinary stone formation .	
21272865-1	Very few population studies have been performed to determine the relationship between environmental cadmium exposure and urinary stone disease .	
21272865-2	This population-based study examined an association between urinary cadmium excretion , a good biomarker of long-term cadmium exposure , and prevalence of urinary stones in persons aged 15 years and older , who lived in the 12 cadmium-contaminated villages in the Mae Sot District , Tak Province , northwestern Thailand .	1 12 127
21272865-3	A total of 6748 persons were interviewed and screened for urinary cadmium and urinary stone disease in 2009 .	1 12 127
21272865-4	To test a correlation between urinary excretion of cadmium and calcium , we measured urinary calcium content in 1492 persons , who lived in 3 villages randomly selected from the 12 contaminated villages .	1 12 127
21272865-5	The rate of urinary stones significantly increased from 4.3% among persons in the lowest quartile of urinary cadmium to 11.3% in the highest quartile .	
21272865-6	An increase in stone prevalence with increasing urinary cadmium levels was similarly observed in both genders .	1 12 127
21272865-7	Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a positive association between urinary cadmium levels and stone prevalence , after adjusting for other co-variables .	
21272865-8	The urinary calcium excretion significantly increased with increasing urinary cadmium levels in both genders , after adjusting for other co-variables .	
21272865-9	Elevated calciuria induced by cadmium might increase the risk of urinary stone formation in this environmentally exposed population .	11 1 11122 1112 111
20452652-0	Cadmium is one of the many substances that may be acquired through active and passive smoking of tobacco .	
20452652-1	Saliva and urine are proposed for cadmium monitoring of non-smokers , second hand smokers , smokers and tobacco chewing appertaining to San Luis citizens without occupational exposition .	
20452652-2	Biological samples were collected by the same subjects , under strict proceeding instructions of sampling .	
20452652-3	Physical characteristics of samples were observed and checked with commercial test .	
20452652-4	Samples were analyzed using an adapted molecular fluorescence methodology with a previous extraction step .	
20452652-5	Stability of biological samples was daily studied for a period of one month .	
20452652-6	The method was successfully validated for accuracy , precision , linearity , specificity , and sensitivity .	
20452652-7	The simplicity and low coefficient of variance confirm the suitability of the method for urinary and salivary cadmium analyses .	1 12 125 127
20452652-8	On the other side , the obtained results are in concordance with previous national epidemiological dates .	
12676616-0	In 1995 , daily mortality in a district of Chongqing , China , was analyzed from January through December for associations with daily ambient sulfur dioxide and fine particles ( airborne particles with diameters less than or equal to 2.5 microm ; PM2.5 .	2 231 23
12676616-1	The mean concentration of PM2.5 was 147 microg/m3 ( maximum , 666 microg/m3 ) , and that of SO2 was 213 microg/m3 ( maximum , 571 microg/m3 ) .	
12676616-2	On average , 9.6 persons died each day .	
12676616-3	We used a generalized additive model using robust Poisson regression to estimate the associations of mean daily SO2 and PM2.5 with daily mortality ( on the same day and at lags up to 5 days ) adjusted for trend , season , temperature , humidity , and day of the week .	2 231 23
12676616-4	The relative risk of mortality associated with a 100 microg/m3 increase in mean daily SO2 was highest on the second lag day [ 1.04 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.00-1.09 ] and the third lag day ( 1.04 ; 95% CI , 0.99-1.08 ) .	2 231 23
12676616-5	The associations between daily mortality and mean daily PM2.5 were negative and statistically insignificant on all days .	
12676616-6	The relative risk of respiratory mortality on the second day after a 100 microg/m3 increase in mean daily SO2 was 1.11 ( 95% CI , 1.02-1.22 ) , and that for cardiovascular mortality was 1.10 ( 95% CI , 1.02-1.20 ) .	
12676616-7	The relative risk of cardiovascular mortality on the third day after a 100 microg/m3 increase in mean daily SO2 was 1.20 ( 95% CI , 1.11-1.30 ) .	
12676616-8	The relative risks of mortality due to cancer and other causes were insignificant on both days .	
12676616-9	The estimated effects of mean daily SO2 on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality risk remained after controlling for PM2.5 .	
20452023-0	This study investigated the levels of 4-nonylphenol ( 4-NP ) , bisphenol A ( BPA ) and triclosan ( TCS ) in bottled water and tap water in Guangzhou and release of these chemicals from baby bottles using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization .	
20452023-1	Results show that 4-NP was present in all the bottled water while 17 out of 21 contained BPA and 18 out of 21 contained TCS .	
20452023-2	Their concentrations in bottled water ranged from 108 to 298 ng/L , 17.6 to 324 ng/L and 0.6 to 9.7 ng/L , respectively .	
20452023-3	Five of the tap water samples from six drinking water plants were found to contain 4-NP and BPA both in June and December , while TCS was detected in the same five plants only in June .	
20452023-4	The highest concentrations in tap water for 4-NP , BPA and TCS were 1987 , 317 and 14.5ng/L , respectively .	
20452023-5	Daily intakes of 4-NP , BPA and TCS of adults by drinking 2L of tap water were estimated to be 1410 , 148 and 10 ng/day , respectively .	24 2 241
20452023-6	BPA was found to be released within 24h from four brands of baby bottles at room temperature ( 24 degrees C ) , 40 degrees C and 100 degrees C. Increased temperature led to higher release of BPA from the baby bottles .	
20452023-7	Estimated daily intakes of 4-NP , BPA and TCS for infants were 705 , 1340 and 5 ng/day , respectively , by drinking 1L of tap water from a baby bottle at 40 degrees C. This study showed that the exposure to the three compounds from drinking water is unlikely to pose a health risk .	24 2 241
12676623-0	Consumption of food containing mercury has been identified as a health risk .	
12676623-1	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S .	
12676623-2	EPA ) and the National Academy of Sciences recommend keeping the whole blood mercury level &lt ; 5.0 microg/L or the hair level &lt ; 1.0 microg/g .	
12676623-3	This corresponds to a reference dose ( RfD ) of 0.1 microg/kg body weight per day .	
12676623-4	All patients in a 1-year period ( n = 720 ) who came for an office visit in a private internal medicine practice in San Francisco , California , were evaluated for mercury excess using the current RfD .	
12676623-5	One hundred twenty-three patients were tested ( 93 females , 30 males ) .	
12676623-6	Of these , data were statistically analyzed for 89 subjects .	
12676623-7	Mercury levels ranged from 2.0 to 89.5 microg/L for the 89 subjects .	
12676623-8	The mean for 66 women was 15 microg/L [ standard deviation ( SD ) = 15 ] , and for 23 men was 13 microg/L ( SD = 5 ) ; 89% had levels exceeding the RfD .	
12676623-9	Subjects consumed 30 different forms or types of fish .	24 2 243
12676623-10	Swordfish had the highest correlation with mercury level .	
12676623-11	Sixty-seven patients with serial blood levels over time after stopping fish showed a decline in mercury levels ; reduction was significant ( p &lt ; 0.0001 ) .	1 122 12
12676623-12	A substantial fraction of patients had diets high in fish consumption ; of these , a high proportion had blood mercury levels exceeding the maximum level recommended by the U.S. EPA and National Academy of Sciences .	24 2 243
12676623-13	The mean level for women in this survey was 10 times that of mercury levels found in a recent population survey by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .	
12676623-14	Some children were &gt ; 40 times the national mean .	24 12 1 122 2 243
20478284-0	BACKGROUND Although interactions of arsenite and selenite in mammalian organisms have been suggested by literature data , the antioxidant effects and biochemical mechanisms of dietary selenium on human populations exposed to inorganic arsenic are not fully understood .	
20478284-1	METHODS Total blood , urine and hair concentrations of arsenic and selenium were determined in all individuals by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry .	1 122 12 127 123
20478284-2	The individuals with skin lesions were subsequently classified as " High As group " and " High Se/As group " and controls were classified as " High Se group " and " Control group " according to their blood selenium concentrations .	11 1 122 12 112
20478284-3	RESULTS High selenium status was correlated with elevated activities of serum superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , catalase , and reduced levels of malondialdehyde , and increased RNA and protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) of individuals in the high arsenic group .	11 1111 11122 1 1113 1112 111 1114
20478284-4	Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels were positively associated with blood arsenic , but inversely with blood and hair selenium among individuals with skin lesions , whereas mRNA are protein levels of 8-oxoganine DNA glycosylase 1 in PBMC increased in the " High Se/As group " compared to the " High As group " .	11 1111 12 11122 1 122 123 111 1114 1112
20478284-5	CONCLUSIONS Inorganic arsenic exposure is associated with oxidative stress , which may be prevented by high selenium status via its antioxidative activity and detoxification effect possibly through the formation of an arsenic and selenium containing metabolite , the seleno-bis(S-glutathionyl) arsinium ion .	11 1 1113 111 1114
20487582-0	Maternal seafood intake is of great health interest since it constitutes an important source of n-3 fatty acids , but provides also an important pathway for fetal exposure to Hg .	
20487582-1	The objective of the present study was to determine associations between Hg contamination and both maternal seafood consumption and fetal growth in French pregnant women .	
20487582-2	Pregnant women included in the ' EDEN mother-child ' cohort study answered FFQ on their usual diet in the year before and during the last 3 months of pregnancy , from which frequencies of seafood intake were evaluated .	24 2 243
20487582-3	Total hair-Hg level was determined for the first 691 included women .	1 123 12
20487582-4	Associations between Hg level , seafood intake and several neonatal measurements were studied using linear regressions adjusted for confounding variables .	
20487582-5	The median Hg level for mothers was 0.52 Î¼g/g .	1 12 123
20487582-6	Maternal seafood intake was associated with Hg level ( r 0.33 ; P &lt ; 0.0001 ) .	24 2 243
20487582-7	There was no association between Hg level and fetal growth in the whole sample of women , except for an early negative relationship with biparietal diameter .	1 11 112
20487582-8	A positive association was found between seafood intake and fetal growth in overweight women only which remained unchanged after adjustment for Hg level ( birth weight : +101 g for a difference of 1 sd in seafood consumption ; P = 0.008 ) .	
20487582-9	Although seafood intake was associated with Hg contamination in French pregnant women , the contamination level was low .	24 2 243
20487582-10	There was no consistent association between Hg level and fetal growth .	
20487582-11	Taking into account Hg level did not modify associations between seafood intake and fetal growth .	
12705940-0	This study examined the exposure level of aromatic volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) in public transportation modes in Guangzhou , China .	
12705940-1	A total of 40 VOC samples were conducted in four popular public commuting modes ( subway , taxis , non-air-conditioned buses and air-conditioned buses ) while traversing in urban areas of Guangzhou .	2 232 23
12705940-2	Traffic-related VOCs ( benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , m/p-xylene and o-xylene ) were collected on adsorbent tubes and analyzed by thermal desorption ( TD ) and gas chromatography/mass-selective detector ( GC/MSD ) technique .	
12705940-3	The results indicate that commuter exposure to VOCs is greatly influenced by the choice of public transport .	
12705940-4	For the benzene measured , the mean exposure level in taxis ( 33.6 microg/m(3) ) was the highest and was followed by air-conditioned buses ( 13.5 microg/m(3) ) and non-air-conditioned buses ( 11.3 microg/m(3) ) .	2 232 23
12705940-5	The exposure level in the subway ( 7.6 microg/m(3) ) is clearly lower than that in roadway transports .	
12705940-6	The inter-microenvironment variations of other target compounds were similar to that of benzene .	
12705940-7	The target VOCs were well correlated to each other in all the measured transports .	
12705940-8	The concentration profile of the measured transport was also investigated and was found to be similar to each other .	
12705940-9	Based on the experiment results , the average B/T/E/X found in this study was about ( 1.0/4.3/0.7/1.4 ) .	
12705940-10	In this study , the VOC levels measured in evening peak hours were only slightly higher than those in afternoon non-peak hours .	
12705940-11	This is due to the insignificant change of traffic volume on the measured routes between these two set times .	
12705940-12	The out-dated vehicle emission controls and slow-moving traffic conditions may be the major reasons leading elevated in-vehicle exposure level in some public commuting journeys .	
12708228-0	We analyzed 85 urine samples of the general German population for human specific metabolites of phthalates .	1 12 127
12708228-1	By that we avoided contamination with the parent phthalates being omnipresent in the environment and for the first time could deduce each individual's internal exposure to phthalates without contamination .	
12708228-2	Determined were the secondary metabolites mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalate ( 5OH-MEHP ) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxo-hexyl)phthalate ( 5oxo-MEHP ) of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) and the primary monoester metabolites of DEHP , di-noctylphthalate ( DnOP ) , di-n-butylphthalate ( DnBP ) , butylbenzylphthalate ( BBzP ) and diethylphthalate ( DEP ) .	
12708228-3	Based on these internal exposure values we calculated the daily intake of the parent phthalates using urinary metabolite excretion factors .	2 21
12708228-4	For DEHP we determined a median intake of 13.8 micrograms/kg body weight/day and an intake at the 95th percentile of 52.1 micrograms/kg body weight/day .	2
12708228-5	The tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) value settled by the EU Scientific Committee for Toxicity , Ecotoxicity and the Environment ( CSTEE ) is 37 micrograms/kg body weight/day .	
12708228-6	Twelve percent of the subjects ( 10 out of 85 samples ) within our collective of the general population are exceeding this value .	
12708228-7	Thirty-one percent of the subjects ( 26 out of 85 samples ) had values higher than the reference dose ( RfD ) of 20 micrograms/kg body weight/day of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .	
12708228-8	For DnBP , BBzP , DEP and DnOP intake values at the 95th percentile were 16.2 , 2.5 , 22.1 and 0.42 micrograms/kg body weight/day respectively .	
12708228-9	Our results unequivocally prove that the general German population is exposed to DEHP to a much higher extent than previously believed .	
12708228-10	This is of greatest importance for public health since DEHP is not only the most important phthalate with respect to its production , use , occurrence and omnipresence but also the phthalate with the greatest endocrine disrupting potency .	
12708228-11	DEHP is strongly suspected to be a developmental and reproductive toxicant .	
12708228-12	We are not aware of any other environmental contaminant for which the TDI and RfD are exceeded to such an extent within the general population .	
12708228-13	The transgressions of the TDI and RfD for DEHP are accompanied by considerable ubiquitous exposures to DnBP and BbzP , two phthalates under scrutiny for similar toxicological mechanisms .	
20418200-0	BACKGROUND Benzene is a common industrial chemical known to induce leukemia and other blood disorders , as well as aneuploidy , in both human blood cells and sperm at exposures &gt ; 10 ppm .	
20418200-1	Recent reports have identified health effects at exposure levels &lt ; 1 ppm , the permissible exposure limit ( PEL ; 8 hr ) set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration .	
20418200-2	OBJECTIVE We investigated whether occupational exposures to benzene near 1 ppm induce aneuploidy in sperm .	1111 1 111 11
20418200-3	METHODS We used multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization to measure the incidence of sperm with numerical abnormalities of chromosomes X , Y , and 21 among 33 benzene-exposed men and 33 unexposed men from Chinese factories .	12 23 1 2 127 233
20418200-4	Individual exposures were assessed using personal air monitoring and urinary concentrations of benzene and trans,trans-muconic acid ( E,E-MA ) .	12 23 1 2 127 233
20418200-5	Air benzene concentrations were not detectable in unexposed men ; in exposed men , concentrations ranged from below the detection limit to 24 ppm ( median , 2.9 ppm ) , with 27% of exposed men ( n = 9 ) having concentrations of &lt;or= 1 ppm .	
20418200-6	Exposed men were categorized into low and high groups based on urinary E,E-MA ( median concentrations of 1.9 and 14.4 mg/L , respectively ; median air benzene of 1 and 7.7 ppm , respectively ) , and aneuploidy frequencies were compared with those of unexposed men .	1 12 127
20418200-7	RESULTS Sperm aneuploidy increased across low- and high-exposed groups for disomy X [ incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) = 2.0 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.1-3.4 ; and IRR = 2.8 ; 95% CI , 1.5-4.9 , respectively ] , and for overall hyperhaploidy for the three chromosomes investigated ( IRR = 1.6 ; 95% CI , 1.0-2.4 ; and IRR = 2.3 ; 95% CI , 1.5-3.6 , respectively ) .	
20418200-8	We also found elevated disomy X and hyperhaploidy in the nine men exposed to &lt;or= 1 ppm benzene compared with unexposed men ( IRR = 1.8 ; 95% CI , 1.1-3.0 ; and IRR = 2.0 ; 95% CI , 1.1-3.9 , respectively ) .	
20418200-9	CONCLUSIONS Benzene appeared to increase the frequencies of aneuploid sperm for chromosomes associated with chromosomal abnormality syndromes in human offspring , even in men whose air benzene exposure was at or below the U.S. permissible exposure limit .	
20505983-0	Remediation aimed at reducing human exposure to groundwater arsenic in West Bengal , one of the regions most impacted by this environmental hazard , are currently largely focussed on reducing arsenic in drinking water .	
20505983-1	Rice and cooking of rice , however , have also been identified as important or potentially important exposure routes .	
20505983-2	Quantifying the relative importance of these exposure routes is critically required to inform the prioritisation and selection of remediation strategies .	
20505983-3	The aim of our study , therefore , was to determine the relative contributions of drinking water , rice and cooking of rice to human exposure in three contrasting areas of West Bengal with different overall levels of exposure to arsenic , viz. high ( Bhawangola-I Block , Murshidibad District ) , moderate ( Chakdha Block , Nadia District ) and low ( Khejuri-I Block , Midnapur District ) .	24 2 241 243
20505983-4	Arsenic exposure from water was highly variable , median exposures being 0.02Î¼g/kg/d ( Midnapur ) , 0.77Î¼g/kg/d ( Nadia ) and 2.03Î¼g/kg/d ( Murshidabad ) .	24 2 241
20505983-5	In contrast arsenic exposure from cooked rice was relatively uniform , with median exposures being 0.30Î¼g/kg/d ( Midnapur ) , 0.50Î¼g/kg/d ( Nadia ) and 0.84Î¼g/kg/d ( Murshidabad ) .	24 2 243
20505983-6	Cooking rice typically resulted in arsenic exposures of lower magnitude , indeed in Midnapur , median exposure from cooking was slightly negative .	24 2 243
20505983-7	Water was the dominant route of exposure in Murshidabad , both water and rice were major exposure routes in Nadia , whereas rice was the dominant exposure route in Midnapur .	24 2 241 243
20505983-8	Notwithstanding the differences in balance of exposure routes , median excess lifetime cancer risk for all the blocks were found to exceed the USEPA regulatory threshold target cancer risk level of 10(-4)-10(-6) .	
20505983-9	The difference in balance of exposure routes indicate a difference in balance of remediation approaches in the three districts .	
12727600-0	There is widespread concern regarding the safety of silver-mercury amalgam dental restorations , yet little evidence to support their harm or safety .	
12727600-1	We examined whether mercury dental amalgams are adversely associated with cognitive functioning in a cross-sectional sample of healthy working adults .	11 24 1 244 2 112
12727600-2	We studied 550 adults , 30-49 years of age , who were not occupationally exposed to mercury .	
12727600-3	Participants were representative of employees at a major urban medical center .	
12727600-4	Each participant underwent a neuropsychologic test battery , a structured questionnaire , a modified dental examination , and collection of blood and urine samples .	11 1 127 12 112
12727600-5	Mercury exposure was assessed using a ) urinary mercury concentration ( UHg ) ; b ) the total number of amalgam surfaces ; and c ) the number of occlusal amalgam surfaces .	24 12 1 244 2 127
12727600-6	Linear regression analysis was used to estimate associations between each marker of mercury exposure and each neuropsychologic test , adjusting for potential confounding variables .	1 11 112
12727600-7	Exposure levels were relatively low .	
12727600-8	The mean UHg was 1.7 micro g/g creatinine ( range , 0.09-17.8 ) ; the mean total number of amalgam surfaces was 10.6 ( range , 0-46 ) and the mean number of occlusal amalgam surfaces was 6.1 ( range , 0-19 ) .	24 244 2
12727600-9	No measure of exposure was significantly associated with the scores on any neuropsychologic test in analyses that adjusted for the sampling design and other covariates .	
12727600-10	In a sample of healthy working adults , mercury exposure derived from dental amalgam restorations was not associated with any detectable deficits in cognitive or fine motor functioning .	1 11 112
21237513-0	There are at present very few studies of the effects of polybromodiphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , used as flame retardants in consumer products , on neurodevelopment or thyroid hormone levels in humans .	
21237513-1	The present study aims to examine the association between pre and postnatal PBDE concentrations and neurodevelopment and thyroid hormone levels in children at age 4years and isolate the effects of PBDEs from those of PCBs , DDT , DDE and HCB .	11 1 1112 111 112
21237513-2	A prospective birth cohort in Menorca ( Spain ) enrolled 482 pregnant mothers between 1997 and 1998 .	
21237513-3	At 4years , children were assessed for motor and cognitive function ( McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities ) , attention-deficit , hyperactivity and impulsivity ( ADHD-DSM-IV ) and social competence ( California Preschool Social Competence Scale ) .	1 11 112
21237513-4	PBDE concentrations were measured in cord blood ( N=88 ) and in serum of 4years olds ( N=244 ) .	1 122 12
21237513-5	Among all congeners analyzed only PBDE 47 was quantified in a reasonable number of samples ( LOQ=0.002ng/ml ) .	
21237513-6	Exposure to PBDE 47 was analyzed as a dichotomous variable : concentrations above the LOQ ( exposed ) and concentrations below ( referents ) .	
21237513-7	Scores for cognitive and motor functions were always lower in children pre and postnatally exposed to PBDE47 than in referents , but none of these associations was statistically significant ( Î² coefficient ( 95%CI ) of the total cognition score : -2.7 ( -7.0 , 1.6 ) for postnatal exposure , and -1.4 ( -9.2 , 6.5 ) for prenatal exposure ) .	1 11 112
21237513-8	Postnatal exposure to PBDE 47 was statistically significantly related to an increased risk of symptoms on the attention deficit subscale of ADHD symptoms ( RR ( 95%CI)=1.8 ( 1.0 , 3.2) ) but not to hyperactivity symptoms .	
21237513-9	A statistically significant higher risk of poor social competence symptoms was observed as a consequence of postnatal PBDE 47 exposure ( RR ( 95%CI)=2.6 ( 1.2 , 5.9) ) .	
21237513-10	Adjustment for other organochlorine compounds did not influence the results .	
21237513-11	Levels of thyroid hormones were not associated to PBDE exposure .	1 11 1112 111
21237513-12	This study highlights the importance of assessing the effects of PBDE exposure not just prenatally but also during the early years of life .	
21237513-13	In the light of current evidence a precautionary approach towards PBDE exposure of both mothers and children seems warranted .	
20546995-0	Tens of millions of people worldwide ingest excessive amounts of arsenic ( As ) through drinking water and food .	
20546995-1	The dietary intake of seafood is the major As exposure route in humans and can cause As-related adverse health effects including cancers .	
20546995-2	The aim of this study was to quantify potential cancer risks of As exposure for children and adults through seafood consumption .	24 2 243
20546995-3	By coupling the age-specific physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) model and a Weibull-based dose-response function , a more accurate estimate of urinary arsenic metabolites could be achieved to better characterize potential cancer risks .	2 21
20546995-4	The simulation results show that the proportion of inorganic As , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) in human urine are estimated to total 6.7 , 26.9 , and 66.4% for children , and 6.2 , 27.4 , and 66.4% for adults , respectively .	
20546995-5	The estimated median cumulative cancer incidence ratios were respectively 2.67x10(-6) and 3.83x10(-6) for children and adults , indicating a low cancer risk for local residents exposed to As through the consumption of seafood .	24 2 243
20546995-6	However , it is necessary to incorporate other exposure routes into the model to make it more realistic .	
20546995-7	The methodology proposed here can not only be applied to calculate the concentrations of As metabolites in urine , but also to provide a direct estimation of adverse health effects caused by the calculated internal concentrations .	
20417154-0	In this paper an integrated approach in assessment of the population exposure from various sources of total mercury ( THg ) oral intake in the Czech Republic is presented .	
20417154-1	The information on total mercury levels in diet , drinking water , surface urban soil and body fluids and tissues stem from the Czech national Environmental Health Monitoring System ( EHMS ) operated since 1994 .	
20417154-2	The THg concentration was determined by the special atomic absorption spectrophotometer AMA 254 .	
20417154-3	The data on THg content in food from the sales network were collected in 12 cities .	
20417154-4	The estimated average dietary intake representing more than 95% of weight of usual diet composition ranged 1-2% of the JECFA/FAO WHO provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI ) value for total mercury ( 5 microg/kg b.w./week ) .	24 2 243
20417154-5	Data on drinking water quality stem from the nationwide monitoring database .	
20417154-6	The content of THg in drinking water is generally low ; only 0.2% of the Czech population supplied with drinking water from the distribution networks ( total of 92% of the population ) has a mercury intake from drinking water higher than 1% PTWI and not exceeding 5% PTWI .	24 2 241
20417154-7	The estimation of potential mercury intake by unintentional consumption of soil in small children was based on THg content in surface soil of a total of 324 nursery schools in 24 cities and towns .	24 245 2
20417154-8	Median value was 0.16 mg/kg .	
20417154-9	Human biomonitoring was performed in 9 Czech cities .	
20417154-10	In 2007 , the mercury median values in blood of adults ( N=412 ) were 0.85 and 0.89 microg/l in males and in females , respectively ; urine median value in adults was 1.10 microg/g creatinine .	1 122 12
20417154-11	In 2008 , the blood median value in children ( N=324 ) amounted to 0.35 microg/l ; urine median value is 0.16 microg/g creatinine .	1 122 12 127
20417154-12	In children's hair the median THg value was 0.18 microg/g .	1 12 123
20417154-13	The correlation between fish consumption and blood THg levels was observed in both adults and children .	24 2 243
20417154-14	Also the biomonitoring outputs did not reveal a substantial burden of the population .	
12738286-0	Congener-specific analyses of 7 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , 10 polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and 4 non-ortho ( coplanar ) polychlorinated biphenyls ( cPCBs ) were performed on 35 samples of commercial long-life pasteurised cows ' milk issued from eight different brands available in Walloon supermarkets ( Belgium ) .	
12738286-1	The observed congener profile was characteristic of milk samples issued from industrialised countries with good inter and intra-brand reproducibility's .	
12738286-2	The PCDDs to PCDFs ratio was equal to 1.8 in concentration .	
12738286-3	The toxic equivalent ( TEQ based on WHO-TEF ) value for PCDD/Fs in all analysed milks was 1.09+/-0.30 pg TEQ/g fat ( range 0.86-1.59 ) , which is below the recommended EU non-commercialisation threshold value of 3 pg TEQ PCDD/Fs/g of milk fat .	
12738286-4	The mean TEQ value including cPCBs was 2.23+/-0.55 pg TEQ/g fat .	
12738286-5	These PCBs actually contributed for 49+/-8.6% of the total TEQ .	
12738286-6	Among PCDD/Fs and cPCBs , tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) , pentachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin ( PeCDD ) , pentachloro dibenzofurans ( PeCDFs ) and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachloro biphenyl ( PCB-126 ) were the most important contributors to the TEQ .	
12738286-7	Estimated daily intake ( EDI ) due to consumption of such milks was 0.34 pg TEQ/kg of body weight/day for PCDD/Fs and 0.69 pg TEQ/kg of body weight/day when cPCBs were included .	24 2 243
20400180-0	Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) , especially perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , are known to occur throughout the environment and in the human population ( Houde et al. , 2006 ) .	
20400180-1	The occurrence of PFCs in human umbilical cord blood and human milk , coupled with the potential developmental toxicity of PFCs , suggests the need for determining the exposure sources and magnitudes of PFCs in infants .	
20400180-2	In this study , 10 PFCs were measured in 24 pooled samples consisting of 1237 individual human milk samples .	1 12 124
20400180-3	The samples were collected from 12 provinces of China in 2007 .	
20400180-4	PFOS and PFOA were the predominant PFCs found in all the samples tested .	
20400180-5	The geometric mean ( GM ) and median of the concentrations were 46 pg/mL and 49 pg/mL for PFOS , 46 pg/mL and 34.5 pg/mL for PFOA respectively .	
20400180-6	A large variation in geographical distribution was observed for PFCs in human milk .	1 12 124
20400180-7	High concentrations of PFOA ( 814 pg/ml for the rural samples and 616 pg/ml for the urban samples ) were found in human milk from Shanghai .	1 12 124
20400180-8	Estimated dietary intakes ( EDI ) were established and the median , GM and the highest EDI of the total PFCs were 17.2 ng/kg/d , 17.8 ng/kg/d and 129.1 ng/kg/d respectively .	24 2 243
20400180-9	The EDI for PFOA ( 88.4 ng/kg/d ) for Shanghai was close to the tolerable daily intake ( 100 ng/kg/d ) proposed by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment and the Drinking Water Commission .	
20400180-10	The results suggest both mothers and infants have a high exposure to PFCs in the Shanghai region .	
20400180-11	The potential health impact of postnatal exposure through breastfeeding to infants should therefore be comprehensively evaluated .	
20561663-0	BACKGROUND Chronic arsenic exposure is associated with a variety of diseases , including cancer , peripheral vascular disease , and diabetes .	
20561663-1	However , its association with cerebrovascular diseases ( CVD ) has not yet been resolved .	
20561663-2	The aim of this study is to explore this association in Taiwan using nation-wide data .	
20561663-3	MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed mortality data in Taiwan from 1971 to 2005 and choose two geographic areas with populations suffering from chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water for study , the blackfoot disease endemic area ( BFDEA ) in the southwest and Lan-Yang Basin ( LYB ) in the northeast parts of Taiwan .	24 2 241
20561663-4	The Chia-Yi and Tainan Counties , which surround the BFDEA , and the nation of Taiwan as a whole were used as reference populations .	
20561663-5	Direct standardized mortality rates and gender-specific indirect standardized mortality ratios ( SMRs ) were calculated for the four populations .	
20561663-6	RESULTS The direct standardized mortality rate for CVD in Taiwan decreased from 2.46/10(3) person-year in 1971 to 0.63/10(3) person-year in 2005 , and women had significantly lower mortality than men ( SMR = 0.80 ; p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20561663-7	The CVD mortality rates of populations with chronic arsenic exposure were significantly higher than the reference populations ( SMR ranging from 1.06 to 1.09 in men and 1.12 to 1.14 in women ; p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20561663-8	The BFDEA had higher CVD mortality rates than the LYB , with SMR = 1.05 ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) in men and SMR = 1.04 ( p = 0.05 ) in women .	
20561663-9	CONCLUSION In Taiwan , while CVD mortality decreased in both genders between 1971 and 2005 , chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water was associated with increased risks of CVD .	24 2 241
21228698-0	BACKGROUND Much time is spent in traffic , especially during rush hours , when air pollution concentrations on roads are relatively high .	
21228698-1	Controlled exposure studies have shown acute respiratory effects of short , high exposures to air pollution from motor vehicles .	
21228698-2	Acute health effects of lower real-life exposures in traffic are unclear .	
21228698-3	METHODS Exposures of 34 healthy , nonsmoking adult volunteers were repeatedly measured while commuting for 2 hours by bus , car , or bicycle .	2 233 23
21228698-4	Particle number ( PN ) , particulate matter ( PM2.5 and PM10 ) , and soot exposures were measured .	2 233 23
21228698-5	Lung function and airway resistance were measured directly before , directly following , and 6 hours after exposure .	1 11 112
21228698-6	Exhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) was measured directly before and 6 hours after exposure .	11 1 11122 1112 111
21228698-7	Inhaled doses were estimated based on monitored heart rates .	2 233 23
21228698-8	Mixed models were used to analyze effects of exposure on changes in health parameters after exposure compared with before .	
21228698-9	RESULTS PN , PM10 , and soot were associated with decreased peak expiratory flow directly following but not 6 hours after exposure .	1 11 112
21228698-10	PN doses were associated with decreases in maximum midexpiratory flow and forced expiratory flow ( FEV1 ) 6 hours after exposure , whereas PN and soot exposures were associated with increased maximum midexpiratory flow and FEV1 directly after exposure .	1 11 112
21228698-11	PN and soot were associated with increased exhaled NO after car and bus but not bicycle trips .	
21228698-12	PN was also associated with an increase in airway resistance directly following exposure but not 6 hours later .	
21228698-13	CONCLUSIONS We found modest effects of 2-hour in-traffic exposure to air pollutants on peak flow , exhaled NO , and airway resistance .	
12782488-0	To assess the arsenic exposure of a population living in the vicinity of a coal-burning power plant with high arsenic emission in the Prievidza District , Slovakia , 548 spot urine samples were speciated for inorganic As ( Asinorg ) , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) , and their sum ( Assum ) .	1 12 127
12782488-1	The urine samples were collected from the population of a case-control study on nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) .	1 12 127
12782488-2	A total of 411 samples with complete As speciations and sufficient urine quality and without fish consumption were used for statistical analysis .	
12782488-3	Although current environmental As exposure and urinary As concentrations were low ( median As in soil within 5 km distance to the power plant , 41 micro g/g ; median urinary Assum , 5.8 microg/L ) , there was a significant but weak association between As in soil and urinary Assum(r = 0.21 , p &lt ; 0.01 ) .	24 245 12 1 2 127
12782488-4	We performed a multivariate regression analysis to calculate adjusted regression coefficients for environmental As exposure and other determinants of urinary As .	
12782488-5	Persons living in the vicinity of the plant had 27% higher Assum values ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) , based on elevated concentrations of the methylated species .	
12782488-6	A 32% increase of MMA occurred among subjects who consumed homegrown food ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	24 2 243
12782488-7	NMSC cases had significantly higher levels of Assum , DMA , and Asinorg .	
12782488-8	The methylation index Asinorg/(MMA + DMA ) was about 20% lower among cases ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) and in men ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) compared with controls and females , respectively .	
20384380-0	Experimental evidence from animals indicates that exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) causes deterioration of the outer hair cells ( OHCs ) of the cochlea .	
20384380-1	To test this hypothesis in humans , we measured serum PCB concentrations in 574 12-year-old children residing in three districts in the Slovak Republic using high-resolution gas chromatography with microelectron capture detection .	1 122 12
20384380-2	As a marker of cochlear status , we measured transient evoked ( TE ) and distortion product ( DP ) otoacoustic emissions ( OAEs ) , and assessed the cross-sectional association between serum PCBs and OAEs .	11 1 122 12 112
20384380-3	Median total PCB concentrations were 352.8 , 150.5 , and 134.9 ng/g lipid in Michalovce , Svidnik , and Bratislava , respectively .	
20384380-4	In multivariate regression models where otoacoustic measures were modeled as a function of log ( base 10 ) PCB concentrations with adjustment for gender , age , and site of examination , dioxin-like PCBs , nondioxin-like PCBs and a PCB grouping targeting upregulation of hepatic uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase were significantly associated with lower TEOAE powers at 1000 and 1500 Hz .	
20384380-5	At 1500 Hz , we observed a strong association with sum of PCBs and DL-PCBs , in the left ear only .	
20384380-6	The DPOAEs at 1000 Hz were associated with all four PCB groupings .	
20384380-7	The results of this study show that PCBs may affect the OHCs of the cochlea , a result consistent with findings from animal studies published to date .	
21227482-0	Arsenic plays an important role in producing oxidative stress in cultured cells .	
21227482-1	To investigate the interaction between high oxidative stress and low arsenic methylation capacity on arsenic carcinogenesis , a case-control study was conducted to evaluate the relationship among the indices of oxidative stress , such as urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyquanine ( 8-OHdG ) , as well as plasma micronutrients and urinary arsenic profiles on urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) risk .	11 1111 12 1 11122 1112 111 1114 127
21227482-2	Urinary 8-OHdG was measured using high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits .	
21227482-3	The urinary arsenic species were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and hydride generator-atomic absorption spectrometry .	1 12 127
21227482-4	Plasma micronutrient levels were analyzed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography .	
21227482-5	The present study showed a significant protective effect of plasma alpha-tocopherol on UC risk .	
21227482-6	Plasma alpha-tocopherol levels were significantly inversely related to urinary total arsenic concentrations and inorganic arsenic percentage ( InAs% ) , and significantly positively related to dimethylarsinic acid percentage ( DMA% ) .	
21227482-7	There were no correlations between plasma micronutrients and urinary 8-OHdG .	
21227482-8	Study participants with lower alpha-tocopherol and higher urinary total arsenic , higher InAs% , higher MMA% , and lower DMA% had a higher UC risk than those with higher alpha-tocopherol and lower urinary total arsenic , lower InAs% , lower MMA% , and higher DMA% .	1 12 127
21227482-9	These results suggest that plasma alpha-tocopherol might modify the risk of inorganic arsenic-related UC .	
21224175-0	BACKGROUND Chlorpyrifos ( CPF ) , a widely used organophosphorus pesticide ( OP ) , is metabolized to CPF-oxon , a potent cholinesterase ( ChE ) inhibitor , and trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPy ) .	
21224175-1	Urinary TCPy is often used as a biomarker for CPF exposure , whereas blood ChE activity is considered an indicator of CPF toxicity .	
21224175-2	However , whether these biomarkers are dose related has not been studied extensively in populations with repeated daily OP exposures .	
21224175-3	OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the relationship between blood ChE and urinary TCPy during repeated occupational exposures to CPF .	1 122 12 127
21224175-4	METHODS Daily urine samples and weekly blood samples were collected from pesticide workers ( n=38 ) in Menoufia Governorate , Egypt , before , during , and after 9-17 consecutive days of CPF application to cotton fields .	1 122 12 127
21224175-5	We compared blood butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) and acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activities with the respective urinary TCPy concentrations in each worker .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
21224175-6	RESULTS Average TCPy levels during the middle of a 1- to 2-week CPF application period were significantly higher in pesticide applicators ( 6,437 Âµg/g creatinine ) than in technicians ( 184 Âµg/g ) and engineers ( 157 Âµg/g ) , both of whom are involved in supervising the application process .	
21224175-7	We observed a statistically significant inverse correlation between urinary TCPy and blood BuChE and AChE activities .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
21224175-8	The no-effect level ( or inflection point ) of the exposure-effect relationships has an average urinary TCPy level of 114 Âµg/g creatinine for BuChE and 3,161 Âµg/g creatinine for AChE .	
21224175-9	CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate a dose-effect relationship between urinary TCPy and both plasma BuChE and red blood cell AChE in humans exposed occupationally to CPF .	
21224175-10	These findings will contribute to future risk assessment efforts for CPF exposure .	
21216722-0	BACKGROUND Previous studies have reported relationships between adverse respiratory health outcomes and residential proximity to traffic pollution , but have not shown this at a personal exposure level .	
21216722-1	OBJECTIVE We compared , among inner-city children with asthma , the associations of adverse asthma outcome incidences with increased personal exposure to particulate matter mass â¤ 2.5 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM(2.5) ) air pollution versus the diesel-related carbonaceous fraction of PM2.5 .	2 233 23
21216722-2	METHODS Daily 24-hr personal samples of PM(2.5) , including the elemental carbon ( EC ) fraction , were collected for 40 fifth-grade children with asthma at four South Bronx schools ( 10 children per school ) during approximately 1 month each .	23 2 233
21216722-3	Spirometry and symptom scores were recorded several times daily during weekdays .	1 11 112
21216722-4	RESULTS We found elevated same-day relative risks of wheeze [ 1.45 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.03-2.04) ] , shortness of breath ( 1.41 ; 95% CI , 1.01-1.99 ) , and total symptoms ( 1.30 ; 95% CI , 1.04-1.62 ) with an increase in personal EC , but not with personal PM(2.5) mass .	11 23 1 2 112 233
21216722-5	We found increased risk of cough , wheeze , and total symptoms with increased 1-day lag and 2-day average personal and school-site EC .	2 233 23
21216722-6	We found no significant associations with school-site PM(2.5) mass or sulfur .	
21216722-7	The EC effect estimate was robust to addition of gaseous pollutants .	
21216722-8	CONCLUSION Adverse health associations were strongest with personal measures of EC exposure , suggesting that the diesel " soot " fraction of PM(2.5) is most responsible for pollution-related asthma exacerbations among children living near roadways .	
21216722-9	Studies that rely on exposure to PM mass may underestimate PM health impacts .	
20377175-0	In this study , 10 perfluorochemicals ( PFCs ) were measured in meat , meat products , and eggs , and in indoor dust , collected in China .	24 2 242
20377175-1	Perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) were the most frequently detected PFCs in these samples .	
20377175-2	Mean concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in foodstuffs were in the range of 0.05-1.99 ng/g fresh wt and 0.06-12.5 ng/g fresh wt , respectively .	
20377175-3	The mean concentrations of PFOA , perfluoroheptanoic acid ( PFHpA ) , and PFOS in indoor dust were 205 , 14.0 , and 4.86 ng/g , dry wt , respectively .	24 2 242
20377175-4	The estimated daily intake of PFOS and PFOA from meat , meat products and eggs ( EDI(meat&amp;eggs) ) ranged from 6.00 to 9.64 ng/d and from 254 to 576 ng/d , respectively , when the values below the limit of quantitation ( LOQ ) were assigned as 0 , and from 8.80 to 15.0 ng/d and from 255 to 577 ng/d , respectively , when the values below the LOQ were set at 1/2LOQ .	24 2 243
20377175-5	The EDI(meat&amp;eggs) of PFOS and PFOA increased with increasing family income .	
20377175-6	The estimated daily intake of PFOS and PFOA through inhalation of dust ( EDI(dust) ) ranged from 0.23 to 0.31 ng/d and from 9.68 to 13.4 ng/d , respectively .	24 2 242
20377175-7	The daily intakes of PFOS and PFOA from the consumption of meat , meat products , and eggs , and from dust ingestion , as calculated from our samples in this study , were compared with estimated daily intake of PFCs reported from the concentrations in drinking water , fish and seafood from China .	24 2 243
20377175-8	Our calculations indicate that dietary sources ( EDI(dietary) ) account for the overwhelming proportion of ( &gt;99% for PFOS and 98% for PFOA ) total daily intake ( TDI ) in adults .	24 2 243
20377175-9	The analyzed foodstuffs ( meat , meat products , and eggs ) were not the major contributors to dietary exposure to PFOS , whereas , meat was the primary contributor to dietary exposure to PFOA .	24 2 243
12822131-0	BACKGROUND This study was undertaken in conjunction with an evaluation of the olfactory function of 52 persons exposed to styrene vapors to provide quantitative styrene exposure histories of each subject for use in the interpretation of the results of olfactory function testing .	1 11 112
12822131-1	METHODS Current and historic exposures were investigated .	
12822131-2	Historic exposures were reconstructed from employment records and measurements of styrene exposure made in the subject facilities over the last 15 years .	2 232 23
12822131-3	Current exposures were estimated for every exposed subject though personal air sampling and through pre- and post-shift measurements of urinary metabolites of styrene .	12 23 1 2 127 233
12822131-4	RESULTS The study population had been employed in the reinforced-plastics industry for an average of 12.2 +/- 7.4 years .	
12822131-5	Their mean 8-hr time weighted average ( TWA ) respirator-corrected annual average styrene exposure was 12.6 +/- 10.4 ppm ; mean cumulative exposure was 156 +/- 80 ppm-years .	
12822131-6	The current respirator-corrected 8-hr TWA average exposure was 15.1 +/- 12.0 ppm .	
12822131-7	The mean post-shift urinary mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acid ( PGA ) concentrations were 580 +/- 1,300 and 170 +/- 360 mg/g creatinine , respectively and were highly correlated with air concentrations of styrene .	1 12 127
12822131-8	CONCLUSIONS This quantitative exposure evaluation has provided a well-characterized population , with documented exposure histories stable over time and in the range suitable for the purposes of the associated study of olfactory function .	
20616147-0	Although shortened telomeres have been found in many cancers , elongated telomere length has been observed as an early response after low-dose treatment with various chemical carcinogens in vitro and animal experiments , suggesting low-dose exposure to carcinogenic chemicals may function as a tumour promoter at the very early stage of carcinogenesis in humans .	
20616147-1	This cross-sectional study was performed to examine whether low-dose exposure to persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) , lipophilic xenobiotics that mainly bioaccumulate in adipose tissue , is associated with telomere length of peripheral blood leukocytes in apparently healthy persons .	1111 1 111 11
20616147-2	Telomere length was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction method in 84 apparently healthy Koreans .	1111 1 111 11
20616147-3	Among various POPs , serum concentrations of organochlorine ( OC ) pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and polybrominated diphenylethers were measured .	1 122 12
20616147-4	Most OC pesticides and PCBs were positively and significantly associated with telomere length with correlation coefficients from about +0.25 to +0.35 .	
20616147-5	The strongest associations were observed with p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene , PCB99 , PCB153 , PCB180 , PCB183 and PCB187 .	
20616147-6	When we examined adjusted means of telomere length by quintiles of POPs , the steeper increases of telomere length tended to be observed within relatively lower ranges of POPs .	
20616147-7	Besides serum concentrations of POPs , none of the other variables studied , including age , were associated with telomere length in this study .	1 122 12
20616147-8	We found that telomere length was increasing across low doses of exposure to POPs in which the majority of study subjects were found , suggesting that low-dose POPs may act as a tumour promoter in carcinogenesis in humans .	
21211822-0	Heavy metal contamination from occupational origin is a cause for concern because of its potential accumulation in the environment and in living organisms leading to long term toxic effects .	
21211822-1	This study was aimed to assess Cd , Cr , Mn , Ni and Pb levels in whole blood , urine , axillary hair and saliva from 178 individuals with occupational exposure to heavy metals .	24 12 1 122 123 125 243 127 2
21211822-2	Levels of metal compounds were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry .	
21211822-3	We collected information on occupation , lifestyle habits and food intake by questionnaire .	24 2 243
21211822-4	Multiple linear regression analyses for metal ion concentration in whole blood , urine , axillary hair and saliva were adjusted for age , gender , smoking and alcohol consumption , lifetime workplace exposure , residence area and food habits .	24 12 1 122 123 125 243 127 2
21211822-5	Overall , blood and urine median concentrations found for the five metals analyzed do not exceed biological exposure indexes , so that they are very similar to a non-occupationally exposed population .	1 122 12 127
21211822-6	Toxicokinetic differences may account for the lack of correlations found for metal levels in hair and saliva with those in blood or urine .	12 1 122 123 125 127
21211822-7	For those heavy metals showing higher median levels in blood with respect to hair ( Cd , Mn and Pb ) indicating lesser hair incorporation from blood , the lifetime working experience was inversely correlated with their hair levels .	1 122 12 123
21211822-8	The longer the lifetime working experience in industrial environments , the higher the Mn and Ni concentration in saliva .	1 12 125
21211822-9	Axillary hair and saliva may be used as additional and/or alternative samples to blood or urine for biomonitoring hair Mn , and saliva Ni in subjects with occupational exposure .	
20618979-0	BACKGROUND Arsenic is a potent pollutant that has caused an environmental catastrophe in certain parts of the world including Bangladesh where millions of people are presently at risk due to drinking water contaminated by arsenic .	
20618979-1	Chronic arsenic exposure has been scientifically shown as a cause for liver damage , cancers , neurological disorders and several other ailments .	
20618979-2	The relationship between plasma cholinesterase ( PChE ) activity and arsenic exposure has not yet been clearly documented .	11 1 11123 111 1112
20618979-3	However , decreased PChE activity has been found in patients suffering liver dysfunction , heart attack , cancer metastasis and neurotoxicity .	
20618979-4	Therefore , in this study , we evaluated the PChE activity in individuals exposed to arsenic via drinking water in Bangladesh .	24 2 241
20618979-5	METHODS A total of 141 Bangladeshi residents living in arsenic endemic areas with the mean arsenic exposure of 14.10 +/- 3.27 years were selected as study subjects and split into tertile groups based on three water arsenic concentrations : low ( &lt ; 129 microg/L ) , medium ( 130-264 microg/L ) and high ( &gt ; 265 microg/L ) .	
20618979-6	Study subjects were further sub-divided into two groups ( &lt;or=50 microg/L and &gt ; 50 microg/L ) based on the recommended upper limit of water arsenic concentration ( 50 microg/L ) in Bangladesh .	
20618979-7	Blood samples were collected from the study subjects by venipuncture and arsenic concentrations in drinking water , hair and nail samples were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy ( ICP-MS ) .	24 12 1 123 241 2
20618979-8	PChE activity was assayed by spectrophotometer .	
20618979-9	RESULTS Arsenic concentrations in hair and nails were positively correlated with the arsenic levels in drinking water .	24 12 1 123 241 2
20618979-10	Significant decreases in PChE activity were observed with increasing concentrations of arsenic in water , hair and nails .	
20618979-11	The average levels of PChE activity in low , medium and high arsenic exposure groups were also significantly different between each group .	
20618979-12	Lower levels of PChE activity were also observed in the &gt ; 50 microg/L group compared to the &lt;or=50 microg/L group .	
20618979-13	Moreover , PChE activity was significantly decreased in the skin ( + ) symptoms group compared to those without ( - ) .	
20618979-14	CONCLUSIONS We found a significant inverse relationship between arsenic exposure and PChE activity in a human population in Bangladesh .	
20618979-15	This research demonstrates a novel exposure-response relationship between arsenic and PChE activity which may explain one of the biological mechanisms through which arsenic exerts its neuro-and hepatotoxicity in humans .	
21208638-0	We studied pregnancy-related changes in serum concentrations of five polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs , CB 118 , CB 138 , CB 153 , CB 156 , CB 180 ) , three hydroxylated PCB metabolites ( 4-OH-CB107 , 4-OH-CB146 , 4-OH-CB187 ) , and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) .	1 122 12
21208638-1	Median serum lipid content increased 2-fold between early ( weeks 9-13 ) and late pregnancy ( weeks 35-36 ) ( N=10 ) , whereas median PCB levels in serum lipids decreased 20-46% , suggesting a dilution of PCB concentrations in serum lipids .	
21208638-2	Nevertheless , strong positive intra-individual correlations ( Spearman's r=0.61-0.99 ) were seen for PCBs during the whole study period .	
21208638-3	Thus , if samples have been collected within the same relative narrow time window during pregnancy , PCB results from one single sampling occasion can be used in assessment of relative differences in body burdens during the whole pregnancy period .	
21208638-4	Concentrations of OH-PCBs in blood serum tended to decline as pregnancy progressed , although among some women the concentrations increased at the end of pregnancy .	1 122 12
21208638-5	Positive intra-individual correlations ( r=0.66-0.99 ) between OH-PCB concentrations were observed during the first and second trimester , whereas correlations with third trimester concentrations were more diverging ( r=-0.70-0.85 ) .	
21208638-6	No decline in PCP concentrations was observed during pregnancy and no significant correlations were found between concentrations at different sampling periods .	
21208638-7	Our results suggest that for both OH-PCBs and PCP , sampling has to be more specifically timed depending on the time period during pregnancy that is of interest .	
21208638-8	The differences in patterns of intra- and inter-individual variability of the studied compounds may be due to a combination of factors , including lipid solubility , persistence of the compounds , distribution in blood , metabolic formation , and pregnancy-related changes in body composition and physiological processes .	
12842779-0	The aim of this study was to determine human prenatal and postnatal exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs ( polychlorobiphenylols ; OH-PCBs ) , and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) .	
12842779-1	The median PBDE fresh-weight concentrations in maternal and cord blood plasma and in breast milk were 24 , 4.3 , and 75 pg/g , respectively .	1 122 12 124
12842779-2	The PCB concentrations were approximately 60 times higher in each compartment ( 1,560 , 277 , and 4,310 pg/g , respectively ) .	
12842779-3	Calculated on a lipid weight basis , the levels were comparable in maternal blood plasma and breast milk .	1 122 12
12842779-4	In contrast to PCBs , differences were found between PBDE congener distribution in maternal and cord blood plasma .	
12842779-5	The OH-PCBs constituted up to 26% of the PCB levels in maternal blood plasma and 53% in cord blood plasma , with levels of 120 and 88 pg/g fresh weight , respectively , and in breast milk 3 pg/g .	
12842779-6	The corresponding concentrations for PCP were 2,830 , 1,960 , and 20 pg/g .	
12842779-7	The ratios of PCB to OH-PCB were 13 , 3 , and 1,400 in maternal , cord plasma , and breast milk , respectively .	1 122 12
12842779-8	It is evident that prenatal exposures occur for all the analytes .	
12842779-9	Moreover , the exposure continues after birth via breast milk .	
12842779-10	However , levels of OH-PCBs and PCP in breast milk are low compared with levels in blood plasma .	
12842779-11	Exposures to both PCBs and PBDEs , and in particular to the endocrine-active halogenated phenolic compounds , are of concern and implicate a potential risk for developmental disturbances .	
12842781-0	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are widely used as flame retardants in consumer goods , such as plastics , electronics , textiles , and construction material .	
12842781-1	PBDEs have been found in human milk , fat , and blood samples .	
12842781-2	Rodent studies indicate that PBDEs may be detrimental to neurodevelopment , possibly by lowering thyroid hormone concentrations in blood .	
12842781-3	In the present study , we determined concentrations of PBDEs and thyroid hormones in human fetal and maternal serum .	11 12 11122 1 122 1112 111
12842781-4	Patients presenting in labor to Indiana University and Wishard Memorial County hospitals in Indianapolis , who were older than 18 years , were recruited to participate .	
12842781-5	Twelve paired samples of maternal and cord blood were obtained and analyzed using gas chromatographic mass spectrometry ; thyroid hormone concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay .	11 12 11122 1 122 1112 111
12842781-6	Six congeners of PBDE were measured in maternal and fetal serum samples .	
12842781-7	The concentrations of total PBDEs found in maternal sera ranged from 15 to 580 ng/g lipid , and the concentrations found in fetal samples ranged from 14 to 460 ng/g lipid .	1 122 12
12842781-8	Individual fetal blood concentrations did not differ from the corresponding maternal concentrations , indicating that measurement of maternal PBDE blood levels is useful in predicting fetal exposure ; similarly , other reports have shown a high correlation between PBDE in mother's milk and fetal exposure .	
12842781-9	In accord with reports on other biologic samples , the tetrabrominated PBDE congener BDE-47 accounted for 53-64% of total PBDEs in the serum .	
12842781-10	The concentrations of PBDEs found in maternal and fetal serum samples were 20-106-fold higher than the levels reported previously in a similar population of Swedish mothers and infants .	
12842781-11	In this small sample , there was no apparent correlation between serum PBDEs and thyroid hormone concentrations .	
12842781-12	Our study shows that human fetuses in the United States may be exposed to relatively high levels of PBDEs .	
12842781-13	Further investigation is required to determine if these levels are specific to central Indiana and to assess the toxic potential of these exposure levels .	
20123604-0	BACKGROUND Phthalates can alter steroidogenesis and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma)mediated transcription in rodent tissues .	
20123604-1	The placenta offers a rich source of biomarkers to study these relationships in humans .	
20123604-2	OBJECTIVE We evaluated whether gestational phthalate exposures in humans were associated with altered human placental steroidogenesis and trophoblast differentiation as measured by markers of mRNA transcription .	1111 1 111 11
20123604-3	METHODS We measured seven target genes in placentas collected from 54 Dominican and African-American women at delivery in New York City using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) , normalized to 18S rRNA. qPCR results for the target genes were log-transformed , converted to Z-scores , and grouped into two functional pathways : steroidogenesis ( aromatase , cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme , 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 , and cytochrome P450 1B1 ) and trophoblast differentiation ( PPARgamma , aryl hydrocarbon receptor , and human chorionic gonadotropin ) .	1111 1 111 11
20123604-4	Repeated measures models were used to evaluate the association of phthalate metabolites measured in third-trimester urine samples with each group of target genes , accounting for correlation among the genes within a pathway .	1 12 127
20123604-5	RESULTS Higher urinary concentrations of five phthalate metabolites were associated with lower expression of the target genes reflecting trophoblast differentiation .	11 1111 12 1 111 127
20123604-6	Results were less consistent for genes in the steroidogenesis pathway and suggested a nonlinear dose-response pattern for some phthalate metabolites .	
20123604-7	CONCLUSIONS We observed a significant association between prenatal exposure to phthalates and placental gene expression within two pathways .	1111 1 111 11
20123604-8	Further studies are warranted to understand the significance of this association with respect to fetal development and placental function .	
20732340-0	Chronic arsenic exposure through contaminated drinking water is a major environmental health issue .	
20732340-1	Chronic arsenic exposure is known to exert its toxic effects by a variety of mechanisms , of which generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) is one of the most important .	
20732340-2	A high level of ROS , in turn , leads to DNA damage that might ultimately culminate in cancer .	
20732340-3	In order to keep the level of ROS in balance , an array of enzymes is present , of which catalase ( CAT ) and myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) are important members .	11 1 11123 111 1112
20732340-4	Hence , in this study , we determined the activities of these two enzymes in the sera and chromosomal aberrations ( CA ) in peripheral blood lymphocytes in individuals exposed and unexposed to arsenic in drinking water .	24 1111 1 2 241 11123 11 111 1112
20732340-5	Arsenic in drinking water and in urine was used as a measure of exposure .	24 12 1 2 241 127
20732340-6	Our results show that individuals chronically exposed to arsenic have significantly higher CAT and MPO activities and higher incidence of CA .	
20732340-7	We found moderate positive correlations between CAT and MPO activities , induction of CA and arsenic in urine and water .	
20732340-8	These results indicate that chronic arsenic exposure causes higher CAT and MPO activities in serum that correlates with induction of genetic damage .	
20732340-9	We conclude that the serum levels of these enzymes might be used as biomarkers of early arsenic exposure induced disease much before the classical dermatological symptoms of arsenicosis begin to appear .	
20106937-0	Organochlorines are environmentally persistent contaminants that readily cross the placenta , posing a potential risk to the developing fetus .	
20106937-1	Evidence for neurodevelopmental effects at low levels of these compounds is growing , though few studies have focused on behavioral outcomes .	
20106937-2	The authors investigated the association between prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) levels and behaviors associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , measured with the Conners ' Rating Scale for Teachers ( CRS-T ) , in a cohort of 607 children aged 7-11 years ( median age , 8.2 years ) born in 1993-1998 to mothers residing near a PCB-contaminated harbor in New Bedford , Massachusetts .	1 11 112
20106937-3	The median umbilical cord serum level of the sum of 4 prevalent PCB congeners ( 118 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) was 0.19 ng/g serum ( range , 0.01-4.41 ng/g serum ) .	1 122 12
20106937-4	The authors found higher risk for ADHD-like behaviors assessed with the CRS-T at higher levels of PCBs and p,p'-DDE .	
20106937-5	For example , the authors found higher risk of atypical behavior on the Conners ' ADHD Index for the highest quartile of the sum of 4 PCB congeners versus the lowest quartile ( risk ratio = 1.76 , 95% confidence interval : 1.06 , 2.92 ) and a similar relation for p,p'-DDE .	
20106937-6	These results support an association between low-level prenatal organochlorine exposure and ADHD-like behaviors in childhood .	
20734744-0	The authors have studied the environmental distribution of salts of heavy metals ( cadmium and nickel ) under the influence of climatic and geographic factors and formation of geochemical anomalies .	
20734744-1	They also examined regularities in the accumulation of heavy metals in children's biosubstrates ( hair , urine ) and the nature of impact of their levels on the physical development of children in the organized collective bodies ( preschool institutions ) located in anomalous areas .	1 123 12 127
12854687-0	Estimating the nature and extent of human cancer risks due to arsenic ( As ) in drinking water is currently of great concern , since millions of persons worldwide are exposed to arsenic , primarily through natural enrichment of drinking water drawn from deep wells .	
12854687-1	Humans metabolize and eliminate As through oxidative methylation and subsequent urinary excretion .	
12854687-2	While there is debate as to the role of methylation in activation/detoxification , variations in arsenic metabolism may affect individual risks of toxicity and carcinogenesis .	
12854687-3	Using data from three populations , from Mexico , China , and Chile , we have analyzed the distribution in urine of total arsenic and arsenic species ( inorganic arsenic ( InAs ) , monomethyl arsenic ( MMA ) , and dimethyl arsenic ( DMA ) .	1 12 127
12854687-4	Data were analyzed in terms of the concentration of each species and by evaluating MMA:DMA and ( MMA+DMA):InAs ratios .	
12854687-5	In all persons most urinary As was present as DMA .	1 12 127
12854687-6	Male:female differences were discernible in both high- and low-exposure groups from all three populations , but the gender differences varied by populations .	
12854687-7	The data also indicated bimodal distributions in the ratios of DMA to InAs and to MMA .	
12854687-8	While the gene or genes responsible for arsenic methylation are still unknown , the results of our studies among the ethnic groups in this study are consistent with the presence of functional genetic polymorphisms in arsenic methylation leading to measurable differences in toxicity .	
12854687-9	This analysis highlights the need for continuing research on the health effects of As in humans using molecular epidemiologic methods .	
21193387-0	BACKGROUND Recent toxicological and epidemiological studies have shown associations between particulate matter ( PM ) and adverse health effects , but which PM components are most influential is less well known .	
21193387-1	OBJECTIVES In this study , we used time-series analyses to determine the associations between daily fine PM [ PM â¤ 2.5 Âµm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5) ] concentrations and daily mortality in two U.S. cities-Seattle , Washington , and Detroit , Michigan .	2 231 23
21193387-2	METHODS We obtained daily PM2.5 filters for the years of 2002-2004 and analyzed trace elements using X-ray fluorescence and black carbon using light reflectance as a surrogate measure of elemental carbon .	
21193387-3	We used Poisson regression and distributed lag models to estimate excess deaths for all causes and for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases adjusting for time-varying covariates .	2 231 23
21193387-4	We computed the excess risks for interquartile range increases of each pollutant at lags of 0 through 3 days for both warm and cold seasons .	2 231 23
21193387-5	RESULTS The cardiovascular and respiratory mortality series exhibited different source and seasonal patterns in each city .	
21193387-6	The PM2.5 components and gaseous pollutants associated with mortality in Detroit were most associated with warm season secondary aerosols and traffic markers .	
21193387-7	In Seattle , the component species most closely associated with mortality included those for cold season traffic and other combustion sources , such as residual oil and wood burning .	
21193387-8	CONCLUSIONS The effects of PM2.5 on daily mortality vary with source , season , and locale , consistent with the hypothesis that PM composition has an appreciable influence on the health effects attributable to PM .	
21190684-0	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the reference level of urinary cadmium ( Cd ) that caused renal effects .	1 12 127
21190684-1	An updated hybrid approach was used to estimate the benchmark doses ( BMDs ) and their 95% lower confidence limits ( BMDL ) in subjects with a wide range of exposure to Cd .	
21190684-2	METHODS The total number of subjects was 1509 ( 650 men and 859 women ) in non-polluted areas and 3103 ( 1397 men and 1706 women ) in the environmentally exposed Kakehashi river basin .	
21190684-3	We measured urinary cadmium ( U-Cd ) as a marker of long-term exposure , and Î²2-microglobulin ( Î²2-MG ) as a marker of renal effects .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
21190684-4	The BMD and BMDL that corresponded to an additional risk ( BMR ) of 5% were calculated with background risk at zero exposure set at 5% .	
21190684-5	RESULTS The U-Cd BMDL for Î²2-MG was 3.5Î¼g/g creatinine in men and 3.7 Î¼g/g creatinine in women .	
21190684-6	CONCLUSIONS The BMDL values for a wide range of U-Cd were generally within the range of values measured in non-polluted areas in Japan .	
21190684-7	This indicated that the hybrid approach is a robust method for different ranges of cadmium exposure .	
21190684-8	The present results may contribute further to recent discussions on health risk assessment of Cd exposure .	
20798006-0	OBJECTIVES Although an asthma-like syndrome has been recognised in aluminium smelter workers for over 70â	2 232 23
20798006-1	years , the causal agent has been difficult to identify .	
20798006-2	METHODS An inception cohort study was conducted at two Australian aluminium smelters where 446 employees participated over a period of 9â	2 21
20798006-3	years .	1 11 112
20798006-4	Cumulative exposures between interviews were estimated from job histories using a task exposure matrix based on measurements in the smelters .	
20798006-5	Participants completed an MRC respiratory questionnaire , spirometry and methacholine challenge test .	1 11 112
20798006-6	Data were analysed with generalised estimating equations to allow for repeated measurements of each participant .	1 11 112
20798006-7	RESULTS Wheeze and chest tightness , the two symptoms most closely related to asthma , showed associations with occupational exposures .	
20798006-8	SO(2) exposure was significantly associated with these symptoms , bronchial hyper-responsiveness ( BHR ) to methacholine ( a feature of asthma ) , airflow limitation ( reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio ) and longitudinal decline in lung function .	2 23
20798006-9	Fluoride exposure was associated with the same outcomes , but less strongly .	
20798006-10	Inhalable dust and the benzene soluble fraction ( BSF ) were associated with symptoms of asthma and BHR .	2 232 23
20798006-11	Although many of the exposures were highly correlated , further modelling suggested that of the known respiratory irritants , SO(2) was more likely than fluoride to be primarily responsible for the symptoms observed .	
20798006-12	Fluoride , inhalable dust and SO(2) were the most important airborne contaminants associated with effects on lung function .	
20798006-13	CONCLUSIONS The observed effects were detected at contaminant levels within occupational exposure standards , so further reductions are required , particularly in SO(2) exposures .	
21186023-0	BACKGROUND Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and dibenzo-dioxins ( PCDDs ) may affect the female reproductive system in humans .	
21186023-1	A mass poisoning occurred in Taiwan due to PCBs/PCDFs-contaminated cooking oil , and was called the Yucheng ( oil-disease in Chinese ) .	
21186023-2	We aimed to determine whether Yucheng women were affected in their menstruation .	
21186023-3	METHODS After the event , we followed the exposed individuals and an age-matched neighborhood reference group .	
21186023-4	Menstrual cycle characteristics and age at menarche were obtained by a telephone interview .	1 11 112
21186023-5	We used multiple linear and logistic regression to examine the association between PCBs/PCDFs and menstrual cycle characteristics , after adjusting for confounding factors .	
21186023-6	RESULTS Totally 445 women responded satisfactorily and were included in the analyses of menstrual characteristics .	1 11 112
21186023-7	Menstrual cycle irregularity and dysmenorrheal did not differ between Yucheng and referents .	1 11 112
21186023-8	Yucheng women's menstrual cycles were 0.5 ( 95% CI : 0.0-0.5 ; p=0.03 ) days shorter than those of the referents .	
21186023-9	The Yucheng women with skin lesions caused by PCBs/PCDFs were more prominently affected , with the cycles 1.2 days shorter than the referents .	
21186023-10	Yucheng women exposed to PCBs/PCDFs at the premenacheal period had reduced cycle length ( -0.7 day , 95% CI : -1.4 to 0.0 ; p=0.04 ) and longer days of menstrual flow ( 0.5 day , 95% CI : 0.0-1.0 ; p=0.04 ) .	
21186023-11	Among those women who were exposed at an age of 5-9 years , menarche started slightly earlier with borderline significance .	
21186023-12	CONCLUSIONS Shorter menstrual cycle length and a longer duration of bleeding in each cycle were found among women previously exposed to PCBs/PCDFs .	
21186023-13	These effects were more obviously observed among those exposed at premenarcheal ages .	
21183207-0	BACKGROUND Many poor in developing countries have turned to artisanal small-scale gold mining ( ASGM ) in an attempt to improve their situation .	
21183207-1	However , the mercury used to extract gold from ore is discharged in vaporized form into the environment , where it poses a hazard for human health .	
21183207-2	METHODS As part of an environmental epidemiological study in Mongolia-to evaluate the burden of environmental mercury contamination-urine , blood and hair samples were collected from residents of areas with or without mercury contamination .	1 122 12 127 123
21183207-3	A total of 200 blood , urine and hair samples were analyzed for mercury and divided into three subgroups according to mercury content : ( 1 ) occupational exposure ( high/medium ) ; ( 2 ) environmental exposure ( low ) ; and ( 3 ) no exposure .	1 12 122 123 127
21183207-4	Internal mercury distributions of the subgroups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test .	
21183207-5	The Chi-square test and likelihood ratio proportion were used to compare the findings with threshold limits .	
21183207-6	RESULTS The highest values and greatest differences were seen in the urine samples ( p&lt;0.001 , Kruskal-Wallis ) .	1 12 127
21183207-7	The occupational group showing the highest exposure with a median mercury level of 4.36Î¼g/l ( control group : 0.10Î¼g/l , p&lt;0.001 ) , 7.18Î¼g/g creatinine and 12 results above the threshold limit HBM I ( Human Biomonitoring I ) .	
21183207-8	Even participants from the low-exposure subgroup showed elevated mercury levels ( median 2.88Î¼g/l urine and 2.98Î¼g/g creatinine , p&lt;0.001 ) , with 10 individuals above the HBM I threshold limits .	
21183207-9	DISCUSSION The body burden resulting from the use of mercury in artisanal gold mining is high not only in the miners themselves , an increased mercury hazard was also found for inhabitants of mining areas who were not actively involved in mining .	
21183207-10	Public health support measures are urgently needed to alleviate the situation .	
12896851-0	A 1999 study heightened long-standing concerns over persistent organic pollutant contamination in the Aral Sea area , detecting elevated levels in breast milk and cord blood of women in Karakalpakstan ( western Uzbekistan ) .	
12896851-1	These findings prompted a collaborative research study aimed at linking such human findings with evidence of food chain contamination in the area .	
12896851-2	An international team carried out analyses of organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) on samples of 12 foods commonly produced and consumed in Karakalpakstan .	
12896851-3	Analysis consistently detected long-lasting organochlorine pesticides and their metabolites in all foods of animal origin and in some vegetables such as onions and carrots--two low-cost components of many traditional dishes .	
12896851-4	Levels of PCBs were relatively low in all samples except fish .	
12896851-5	Analyses revealed high levels of PCDDs and PCDFs ( together often termed " dioxins" ) in sheep fat , dairy cream , eggs , and edible cottonseed oil , among other foodstuffs .	
12896851-6	These findings indicate that food traditionally grown , sold , and consumed in Karakalpakstan is a major route of human exposure to several persistent toxic contaminants , including the most toxic of dioxins , 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( 2,3,7,8-TCDD ) .	
12896851-7	Intake estimations demonstrate that consumption of even small amounts of locally grown food may expose consumers to dioxin levels that considerably exceed the monthly tolerable dioxin intake levels set by the World Health Organization .	24 2 243
12896851-8	Data presented in this study allow a first assessment of the risk associated with the consumption of certain food products in Karakalpakstan and highlight a critical public health situation .	24 2 243
12896858-0	Previous investigations have shown that women exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are at increased risk of giving birth to an infant with low birth weight ( &lt ; 2,500 g ) , and that this relationship is stronger for male than for female infants .	
12896858-1	We have tested the hypothesis that residents in a zip code that contains a PCB hazardous waste site or abuts a body of water contaminated with PCBs are at increased risk of giving birth to a low-birth-weight baby .	1 11 112
12896858-2	We used the birth registry of the New York State Vital Statistics to identify all births between 1994 and 2000 in New York State except for New York City .	
12896858-3	This registry provides information on the infant , mother , and father together with the zip code of the mother's residence .	
12896858-4	The 865 state Superfund sites , the 86 National Priority List sites , and the six Areas of Concern in New York were characterized regarding whether or not they contain PCBs as a major contaminant .	
12896858-5	We identified 187 zip codes containing or abutting PCB-contaminated sites , and these zip codes were the residences of 24.5% of the 945,077 births .	
12896858-6	The birth weight in the PCB zip codes was on average 21.6 g less than in other zip codes ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
12896858-7	Because there are many other risk factors for low birth weight , we have adjusted for these using a logistic regression model for these confounders .	1 11 112
12896858-8	After adjusting for sex of the infant , mother's age , race , weight , height , education , income , marital status , and smoking , there was still a statistically significant 6% increased risk of giving birth to a male infant of low birth weight .	
12896858-9	These observations support the hypothesis that living in a zip code near a PCB-contaminated site poses a risk of exposure and giving birth to an infant of low birth weight .	
20064784-0	BACKGROUND We recently reported that the main reason for the documented higher prevalence of arsenic-related skin lesions among men than among women is the result of less efficient arsenic metabolism .	
20064784-1	OBJECTIVE Because smoking has been associated with less efficient arsenic methylation , we aimed to elucidate interactions between tobacco use and arsenic metabolism for the risk of developing skin lesions .	
20064784-2	METHODS We used a population-based case-referent study that showed increased risk for skin lesions in relation to chronic arsenic exposure via drinking water in Bangladesh and randomly selected 526 of the referents ( random sample of inhabitants &gt ; 4 years old ; 47% male ) and all 504 cases ( 54% male ) with arsenic-related skin lesions to measure arsenic metabolites [ methylarsonic acid ( MA ) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA) ] in urine using high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICPMS ) .	11 1 127 12 112
20064784-3	RESULTS The odds ratio for skin lesions was almost three times higher in the highest tertile of urinary %MA than in the lowest tertile .	1 12 127
20064784-4	Men who smoked cigarettes and bidis ( locally produced cigarettes ; 33% of referents , 58% of cases ) had a significantly higher risk for skin lesions than did nonsmoking men ; this association decreased slightly after accounting for arsenic metabolism .	
20064784-5	Only two women smoked , but women who chewed tobacco ( 21% of referents , 43% of cases ) had a considerably higher risk of skin lesions than did women who did not use tobacco .	
20064784-6	The odds ratio ( OR ) for women who chewed tobacco and who had &lt ; or = 7.9%MA was 3.8 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.4-10 ] compared with women in the same MA tertile who did not use tobacco .	
20064784-7	In the highest tertile of %MA or %inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) , women who chewed tobacco had ORs of 7.3 and 7.5 , respectively , compared with women in the lowest tertiles who did not use tobacco .	
20064784-8	CONCLUSION The increased risk of arsenic-related skin lesions in male smokers compared with nonsmokers appears to be partly explained by impaired arsenic methylation , while there seemed to be an excess risk due to interaction between chewing tobacco and arsenic metabolism in women .	
12928151-0	Long-term arsenic exposure is associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases including ischemic heart disease , cerebrovascular disease , and carotid atherosclerosis .	
12928151-1	The pathogenic mechanisms of arsenic atherogenicity are not completely clear .	
12928151-2	A fundamental role for inflammation in atherosclerosis and its complications has become appreciated recently .	
12928151-3	To investigate molecular targets of inflammatory pathway possibly involved in arsenic-associated atherosclerosis , we conducted an exploratory study using cDNA microarray and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify genes with differential expression in arsenic-exposed yet apparently healthy individuals .	1111 1 111 11
12928151-4	As an initial experiment , array hybridization was performed with mRNA isolated from activated lymphocytes of 24 study subjects with low ( 0-4.32 microg/L ) , intermediate ( 4.64-9.00 microg/L ) , and high ( 9.60-46.5 microg/L ) levels of blood arsenic , with each group comprising eight age- , sex- , and smoking frequency-matched individuals .	11 1111 12 1 122 111
12928151-5	A total of 708 transcripts of known human genes were analyzed , and 62 transcripts ( 8.8% ) showed significant differences in the intermediate or high-arsenic groups compared with the low-level arsenic group .	1111 1 111 11
12928151-6	Among the significantly altered genes , several cytokines and growth factors involving inflammation , including interleukin-1 beta , interleukin-6 , chemokine C-C motif ligand 2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( CCL2/MCP1 ) , chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 1/growth-related oncogene alpha , chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 2/growth-related oncogene beta , CD14 antigen , and matrix metalloproteinase 1 ( interstitial collagenase ) were upregulated in persons with increased arsenic exposure .	1111 1 111 11
12928151-7	Multivariate analyses on 64 study subjects of varying arsenic exposure levels showed that the association of CCL2/MCP1 plasma protein level with blood arsenic remained significant after adjustment for other risk factors of cardiovascular diseases .	11 1 11123 111 1112
12928151-8	The results of this gene expression study indicate that the expression of inflammatory molecules may be increased in human subjects after prolonged exposure to arsenic , which might be a contributory factor to the high risk of atherosclerosis in arseniasis-endemic areas in Taiwan .	1111 1 111 11
12928151-9	Further multidisciplinary studies , including molecular epidemiologic investigations , are needed to elucidate the role of arsenic-associated inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease .	
21169129-0	BACKGROUND Exposure of humans to air pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter ( PM ) may result in airway and systemic inflammation and altered immune function .	
21169129-1	One putative mechanism may be through modification of cell-surface costimulatory molecules .	
21169129-2	OBJECTIVES We examined whether changes in expression of costimulatory molecules on circulating cells are associated with ambient levels of fine PM [ aerodynamic diameter â¤ 2.5 Î¼m ( PM2.5) ] in a susceptible population of diabetic individuals .	
21169129-3	METHODS Twenty subjects were studied for 4 consecutive days .	
21169129-4	Daily measurements of PM2.5 and meteorologic data were acquired on the rooftop of the exam site .	2 231 23
21169129-5	Circulating cell-surface markers that mediate innate immune and inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry on each day .	1 11 1113 111
21169129-6	Sensitivity analysis was conducted on glutathione S-transferase M1 ( GSTM1 ) genotype , body mass index , and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) levels to determine their role as effect modifiers .	
21169129-7	Data were analyzed using random effects models adjusting for season , weekday , and meteorology .	
21169129-8	RESULTS We found significantly increased monocyte expression ( mean fluorescent intensity ) of CD80 , CD40 , CD86 , HLA-DR , and CD23 per 10-Î¼g/m3 increase in PM2.5 at 2- to 4-day lag times after exposure .	11 23 1 1113 2 111
21169129-9	These findings were significantly higher in obese individuals , in individuals with HbA1c &gt ; 7% , and in participants who were GSTM1 null .	
21169129-10	CONCLUSIONS Exposure to PM2.5 can enhance antigen-presenting cell phenotypes on circulating cells , which may have consequences in the development of allergic or autoimmune diseases .	
21169129-11	These effects are amplified in diabetic individuals with characteristics that are associated with insulin resistance or with oxidative stress .	
20064773-0	BACKGROUND Global DNA methylation levels have been reported to be inversely associated with blood levels of persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) , xenobiotics that accumulate in adipose tissue .	1 122 12
20064773-1	Whether these associations extend to a population with much lower concentrations of POPs is not known .	
20064773-2	OBJECTIVES This study was performed to examine whether low-dose exposure to POPs was associated with global DNA hypomethylation in Koreans .	1111 1 111 11
20064773-3	METHODS The amount of global DNA hypomethylation was estimated by the percent 5-methyl-cytosine ( %5-mC ) in Alu and LINE-1 assays in 86 apparently healthy Koreans .	1111 1 111 11
20064773-4	Among various POPs , organochlorine ( OC ) pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and polybrominated diphenylethers ( PBDEs ) were measured .	
20064773-5	RESULTS Most OC pesticides were inversely and significantly associated with %5-mC in the Alu assay , with correlation coefficients in the range 0.2 to 0.3 after adjusting for age , sex , body mass index , smoking , and alcohol .	
20064773-6	The strongest OC pesticide associations with %5-mC in the Alu assay were observed with oxychlordane , trans-nonachlor , and p,p -dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene .	
20064773-7	The correlation coefficient of age with %5-mC in the Alu assay was 0.24 , similar to correlations of OC pesticides with %5-mC in the Alu assay .	
20064773-8	Most PCBs and PBDEs showed nonsignificant inverse trends with %5-mC in the Alu assay , but for some PCBs the U-shaped association was significant .	
20064773-9	On the other hand , POPs were not associated with %5-mC in the LINE-1 assay .	
20064773-10	CONCLUSIONS We found that low-dose exposure to POPs , in particular OC pesticides , was associated with global DNA hypomethylation in apparently healthy Koreans .	
12948891-0	Scientific and public concern exists about potential reproductive health effects of persistent chlorinated organic chemicals , such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE , the most stable daughter compound of DDT ) .	
12948891-1	To explore the hypothesis that environmental exposures to PCBs and DDE are associated with altered semen parameters , we conducted a cross-sectional study of 212 male partners of subfertile couples who presented to the Massachusetts General Hospital Andrology Laboratory .	1 11 112
12948891-2	Semen parameters were analyzed as both a continuous measure and dichotomized based on World Health Organization reference values for sperm concentration ( &lt ; 20 million/mL ) , motility ( &lt ; 50% motile ) , and Kruger strict criteria for morphology ( &lt ; 4% normal ) .	1 11 112
12948891-3	The comparison group for the dichotomized analysis was men with all three semen parameters above the reference values .	
12948891-4	In serum , 57 PCB congeners and p,p -DDE were measured by congener-specific analysis using gas chromatography with electron capture detection .	1 122 12
12948891-5	There were dose-response relationships among PCB-138 and sperm motility ( odds ratio per tertile , adjusted for age , abstinence , and smoking , and p-value for trend were , respectively , 1.00 , 1.68 , 2.35 , and p-value = 0.03 ) and morphology ( 1.00 , 1.36 , 2.53 , p-value = 0.04 ) .	1 11 112
12948891-6	There was limited evidence of an inverse relationship between sum of PCBs , as well as those PCBs classified as cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers , with sperm motility and sperm morphology , as well as limited evidence of an inverse association between p,p -DDE and sperm motility .	1 11 112
12948891-7	The lack of a consistent relationship among semen parameters and other individual PCB congeners and groupings of congeners may indicate a difference in spermatotoxicity between congeners .	
12962714-0	The time-trend and recent concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in Japanese mother's milk were investigated .	1 12 124
12962714-1	The time-trend of 16 PBDEs ( BDE-28 , 37 , 47 , 66 , 71 , 75 , 77 , 85 , 99 , 100 , 119 , 153 , 154 , 138 , 183 , and 190 ) in pooled milk samples from mothers living in Osaka between 1973 and 2000 was analyzed .	1 12 124
12962714-2	Additionally , PBDE concentrations in individual milk samples collected from 13 mothers living in Kanagawa and Okayama in 1999 were measured .	1 12 124
12962714-3	The total concentration of all PBDE congeners ( SigmaPBDEs ) measured in the pooled samples increased during the period between 1973 ( &lt;0.01 ng/g lipid ) and 1988 ( 1.64 ng/g lipid ) , and remained low afterwards while showing remarkable changes in PBDE congener profiles .	
12962714-4	The SigmaPBDEs in the 1999 individual milk samples were also low ( 0.56-3.97 ng/g lipid ) , except for a single sample ( 291 ng/g lipid ) .	
12962714-5	The source of this exposure could not be identified .	
20053455-0	We investigated chronic incorporation of metals in individuals from poor families , living in a small , restrict and allegedly contaminated area in SÃ£o Paulo city , the surroundings of the Guarapiranga dam , responsible for water supply to 25% of the city population .	
20053455-1	A total of 59 teeth from individuals 7 to 60 years old were collected .	1 12 125
20053455-2	The average concentrations of Pb , Cd , Fe , Zn , Mn , Ni and Cr were determined with an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer .	
20053455-3	The concentrations of all metals as function of the individuals ' age exhibited a remarkable similarity : peaks between 7 and 10 years and sharply decreasing at higher ages , which could be attributed to alimentary habits and persistence to metals exposure all along the individuals ' life span .	
20053455-4	From all the measured metals , lead and cadmium were a matter of much more concern since their measured values are close to the upper limits of the world wide averages .	
21182763-0	BACKGROUND Geophagy or earth-eating is common amongst some Bangladeshi women , especially those who are pregnant , both in Bangladesh and in the United Kingdom .	
21182763-1	A large proportion of the population in Bangladesh is already exposed to high concentrations of arsenic ( As ) and other toxic elements from drinking contaminated groundwater .	
21182763-2	Additional exposure to As and other toxic elements from non-food sources has not been adequately addressed and here we present the first study to monitor As levels in baked clay ( known as sikor ) .	
21182763-3	METHODS Sikor samples originating from Bangladesh were digested using a microwave digester and analysed for their As , Pb , Cd , Mn , Fe and Zn levels using ICP-MS .	
21182763-4	Detailed As speciation analysis was performed using HPLC-ICP-MS .	
21182763-5	RESULTS Of particular concern were the levels of As ( 3.8-13.1 mg kg(-1) ) , Cd ( 0.09-0.4 mg kg(-1) ) and Pb ( 21-26.7 mg kg(-1) ) present in the sikor samples and their possible impact on human health .	
21182763-6	Speciation analysis revealed that sikor samples contained mainly inorganic As .	
21182763-7	Modest consumption of 50 g of sikor is equivalent to ingesting 370 Î¼g of As and 1235 Î¼g of Pb per day , based on median concentration values .	245 24 2
21182763-8	This level of sikor consumption exceeds the permitted maximum tolerable daily intake ( PMTDI ) of inorganic As by almost 2-fold .	245 24 2
21182763-9	CONCLUSION We conclude that sikor can be a significant source of As , Cd and Pb exposure for the Bangladeshi population consuming large quantities of this material .	
21182763-10	Of particular concern in this regard is geophagy practiced by pregnant women concurrently exposed to As contaminated drinking water .	
21182763-11	Future studies needs to evaluate the bioavailability of As and other elements from sikor and their impact on human health .	
12963397-0	In order to determine the effect of perinatal polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofurans ( PCBs/PCDFs ) exposure on neonatal and childhood teeth in Yucheng children , we carried out complete dental examinations on 73 Yucheng children born to mothers who ingested high levels of PCBs/PCDFs and 75 matched controls , aged 7-11 years , in 1992 .	
12963397-1	Ten of 73 ( 10% ) exposed children were reported to have borne teeth during the neonatal period , while none of the controls did .	
12963397-2	The exposed group also had a significantly higher percentage of teeth with congenitally missing tooth germ compared to the controls ( 29 vs 2.7% ) or rotation ( 19 vs 2.7% ) .	
12963397-3	The percentages of developmental defects increased significantly with increasing maternal serum PCB levels , childhood PCB and PCDF levels , and the duration of breast feeding .	11 1 122 12 112
12963397-4	The maternal PCB level clearly played a more important role in an increased risk of neonatal teeth and developmental defects .	
12963397-5	The defects were apparent from the lowest tertile , with a total PCB level of &lt;10 ppb in maternal serum measured nearest to childbirth .	1 122 12
12963397-6	The number of permanent teeth tended to be less in exposed children than in the control group from the age of 11 years onwards .	
12963397-7	Our present study has demonstrated for the first time a dose-response relationship between perinatal PCBs/PCDFs exposure and dental defects .	
21318004-0	Propylene glycol and glycol ether ( PGE ) in indoor air have recently been associated with asthma and allergies as well as sensitization in children .	
21318004-1	In this follow-up report , sources of the PGEs in indoor air were investigated in 390 homes of pre-school age children in Sweden .	24 2 232 242 23
21318004-2	Professional building inspectors examined each home for water damages , mold odour , building's structural characteristics , indoor temperature , absolute humidity and air exchange rate .	
21318004-3	They also collected air and dust samples .	24 23 2 242
21318004-4	The samples were analyzed for four groups of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and semi-VOCs ( SVOCs ) , including summed concentrations of 16 PGEs , 8 terpene hydrocarbons , 2 Texanols , and the phthalates n-butyl benzyl phthalate ( BBzP ) , and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) .	
21318004-5	Home cleaning with water and mop â¥ once/month , repainting â¥ one room prior to or following the child's birth , and " newest " surface material in the child's bedroom explained largest portion of total variability in PGE concentrations .	24 244 2
21318004-6	High excess indoor humidity ( g/mÂ³ ) additionally contributed to a sustained PGE levels in indoor air far beyond several months following the paint application .	24 244 2 232 23
21318004-7	No behavioral or building structural factors , except for water-based cleaning , predicted an elevated terpene level in air .	
21318004-8	No significant predictor of Texanols emerged from our analysis .	
21318004-9	Overall disparate sources and low correlations among the PGEs , terpenes , Texanols , and the phthalates further confirm the lack of confounding in the analysis reporting the associations of the PGE and the diagnoses of asthma , rhinitis , and eczema , respectively .	
21141999-0	Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are ubiquitously present in the environment and suspected of carcinogenic , neurological , and immunological effects .	
21141999-1	Our purpose was to identify predictors of adipose tissue levels of mono- , di- , and tri-ortho-substituted PCBs experienced by a general population and to establish whether predictors vary according to substitution group .	1 121 12
21141999-2	In this study of 245 randomly selected persons from a prospective Danish cohort of 57,053 persons , we examined geographical area , age , lactation , BMI , and intake of eight major dietary groups as potential determinants of adipose concentrations of mono- , di- , and tri-ortho-substituted PCBs by linear regression analyses .	24 12 1 121 2 243
21141999-3	Lactation , BMI , and intake of fruit , vegetables , and dairy products showed negative associations with PCB concentrations in adipose tissue in all models , and living in Copenhagen city , age , and consumption of fish ( particularly fatty fish ) were positively associated .	24 12 1 121 2 243
21141999-4	The associations between several of the predictors and mono-ortho-substituted PCBs tended to differ from the associations found for di- and tri-ortho-substituted PCBs .	
21141999-5	In conclusion , geography , age , lactation , BMI , and consumption of fatty fish consistently predicted the concentration of PCBs in adipose tissue .	24 2 243
21141999-6	Our results indicate that predictors of PCBs varied according to substitution group , suggesting that ortho-substituted groups should be analyzed separately .	
22721761-0	BACKGROUND Parabens are suspected endocrine disruptors and ubiquitous preservatives used in personal care products , pharmaceuticals , and foods .	
22721761-1	No studies have assessed the variability of parabens in women , including during pregnancy .	
22721761-2	OBJECTIVE We evaluated predictors and variability of urinary paraben concentrations .	
22721761-3	METHODS We measured urinary concentrations of methyl ( MP ) , propyl ( PP ) , and butyl paraben ( BP ) among couples from a fertility center .	1 12 127
22721761-4	Mixed-effects regression models were fit to examine demographic predictors of paraben concentrations and to calculate intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) .	
22721761-5	RESULTS Between 2005 and 2010 , we collected 2,721 spot urine samples from 245 men and 408 women .	1 12 127
22721761-6	The median concentrations were 112 Âµg/L ( MP ) , 24.2 Âµg/L ( PP ) , and 0.70 Âµg/L ( BP ) .	
22721761-7	Urinary MP and PP concentrations were 4.6 and 7.8 times higher in women than men , respectively , and concentrations of both MP and PP were 3.8 times higher in African Americans than Caucasians .	
22721761-8	MP and PP concentrations were slightly more variable in women ( ICC = 0.42 , 0.43 ) than men ( ICC = 0.54 , 0.51 ) , and were weakly correlated between partners ( r = 0.27-0.32 ) .	
22721761-9	Among 129 pregnant women , urinary paraben concentrations were 25-45% lower during pregnancy than before pregnancy , and MP and PP concentrations were more variable ( ICCs of 0.38 and 0.36 compared with 0.46 and 0.44 , respectively ) .	1 12 127
22721761-10	CONCLUSIONS Urinary paraben concentrations were more variable in women compared with men , and during pregnancy compared with before pregnancy .	
22721761-11	However , results for this study population suggest that a single urine sample may reasonably represent an individual's exposure over several months , and that a single sample collected during pregnancy may reasonably classify gestational exposure .	
21805959-0	While the results of animal studies have shown that perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) can modulate concentrations of thyroid hormones in blood , limited information is available on relationships between concentrations of PFCs in human blood serum and fetal thyroid hormones .	
21805959-1	The relationship between concentrations of PFCs in blood and fetal thyroid hormone concentrations or birth weight , and ratios of major PFCs between maternal and fetal serum were determined .	11 12 1 122 1112 111 112
21805959-2	Concentrations of PFCs were measured in blood serum of pregnant women ( n = 44 ) , fetal cord blood serum ( n = 43 ) and breast milk ( n = 35 ) .	1 122 12 124
21805959-3	Total concentrations of thyroxin ( T4 ) , triiodothyronin ( T3 ) and thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) in blood serum were also quantified .	11 12 11122 1 122 11123 111 1112
21805959-4	The ratios of major PFCs in maternal versus fetal serum were 1:1.93 , 1.02 , 0.72 , and 0.48 for perfluorotridecanoic acid ( PFTrDA ) , perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS ) , and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , respectively .	
21805959-5	Fetal PFOS , PFOA , PFTrDA and maternal PFTrDA were correlated with fetal total T4 concentrations , but after adjusting for major covariates , most of the relationships were no longer statistically significant .	
21805959-6	However , the significant negative correlations between maternal PFOS and fetal T3 , and maternal PFTrDA and fetal T4 and T3 remained .	
21805959-7	Since thyroid hormones are crucial in the early development of the fetus , its clinical implication should be evaluated .	
21805959-8	Given the observed trans-placental transfer of PFCs , efforts should be also made to elucidate the exposure sources among pregnant women .	
16719092-0	Recent studies have reported the ubiquitous distribution of perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) , especially perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , in wildlife and human whole blood or serum .	
16719092-1	In 2003 a solid phase extraction method was developed , which allowed the measurement of PFCs in human breast milk .	1 12 124
16719092-2	In the present study , PFCs in samples of human breast milk from 19 individuals from Zhoushan , China , were analyzed by modifying a previously established method , based on weak-anion exchange extraction .	1 12 124
16719092-3	PFOS and PFOA were the two dominant chemicals detected in all the milk samples .	1 12 124
16719092-4	Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA ranged from 45 to 360 ng/L and 47 to 210 ng/L , respectively .	
16719092-5	The maximum concentrations of other PFCs were 100 ng/L for perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) , 62 ng/L for perfluorononanoate ( PFNA ) , 15 ng/L for perfluorodecanoate ( PFDA ) and 56 ng/L for perfluoroundecanoate ( PFUnDA ) .	
16719092-6	Statistically significant correlations between various PFCs suggested a common exposure source to humans .	
16719092-7	No statistically significant correlation was found between concentrations of either PFOS or PFOA and maternal age , weight , or infant weight .	1 11 112
16719092-8	Rate of consumption of fish was found to be positively correlated with PFNA , PFDA , and PFUnDA concentrations .	24 2 243
16719092-9	Daily intake of PFOS for the child via breast milk with greater PFOS concentrations exceeded the predicted conservative reference dose in 1 of 19 samples , indicating that there may be a small potential risk of PFOS for the infants in Zhoushan via the consumption of breast milk .	24 2 243
16721410-0	We recently reported associations between urinary 1-naphthol ( 1N ) levels and several intermediate measures of male reproductive health , namely sperm motility , serum testosterone levels , and sperm DNA damage .	
16721410-1	However , because 1N is a major urinary metabolite of both naphthalene and the insecticide carbaryl , exposure misclassification stemming from differences in exposure source was probable and interpretation of the results was limited .	
16721410-2	As naphthalene , but not carbaryl , is also metabolized to 2-naphthol ( 2N ) , the relationship of urinary 1N to 2N within an individual may give information about source of 1N .	
16721410-3	Utilizing data from two previous studies that measured both 1N and 2N in urine of men exposed to either carbaryl or naphthalene , the present study employed several methods to differentiate urinary 1N arising from exposures to carbaryl and naphthalene among men in the reproductive health study .	1 12 127
16721410-4	When re-evaluating the reproductive health data , techniques for identifying 1N source involved exploring interaction terms , stratifying the data set based on 1N/2N ratios , and performing an exposure calibration using a linear 1N to 2N relationship from a study of workers exposed to naphthalene in jet fuel .	
16721410-5	Despite some inconsistencies between the methods used to distinguish 1N source , we found that 1N from carbaryl exposure is likely responsible for the previously observed association between 1N and sperm motility , whereas 1N from naphthalene exposure is likely accountable for the association between 1N and sperm DNA damage .	1 1111 11 111 112
16721410-6	We demonstrate that studies of health effects associated with carbaryl should utilize a 1N/2N ratio to identify subgroups in which carbaryl is the primary source of 1N .	
16721410-7	Conversely , studies of naphthalene-related outcomes may utilize 2N levels to estimate exposure .	
21793581-0	We measured levels of 10 polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) congeners in serum collected during pregnancy and at delivery from 416 pregnant , predominantly immigrant , women living in Monterey County , CA .	24 12 1 244 122 2
21793581-1	The most frequently detected congeners were BDE-47 , -99 , -100 , and -153 , all components of the penta mixture , detected in &gt;97% of samples .	
21793581-2	We used multivariable regression models to examine factors associated with exposure to individual PBDE congeners as well as their total summed concentration ( ng/g lipid ) .	
21793581-3	Prenatal and delivery total PBDE levels were correlated between sampling times ( n = 21 ; Pearson r = 0.99 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
21793581-4	In multivariable models , total PBDE levels increased significantly with time residing in the U.S .	
21793581-5	( p &lt ; 0.001 ) and among women with â¥3 pieces of stuffed furniture in their homes ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	24 244 2
21793581-6	Women's total PBDE levels increased 4.0% ( 95% CI = 2.8 , 5.3 ) for each additional year residing in the U.S. , after adjustment for prepregnancy BMI , weight gain during pregnancy , and SES .	
21793581-7	Having â¥3 pieces of stuffed furniture in the home was associated with a 26.8% ( 95% CI = 2.0 , 57.5 ) increase in women's serum PBDE levels .	24 12 1 244 122 2
21793581-8	Findings suggest PBDE indoor contamination in California homes is contributing to human exposures in a population of recent immigrants .	
17346867-0	Background exposures provide perspective for interpreting calculated health risks associated with naturally occurring substances such as arsenic .	
17346867-1	Background inorganic arsenic intake from diet and water for children ( ages 1-6 years ) and all ages of the U.S. population was modeled stochastically using consumption data from USDA , published data on inorganic arsenic in foods , and EPA data on arsenic in drinking water .	24 2 241 243
17346867-2	Mean and 90th percentile intakes for the U.S. population were 5.6 and 10.5 microg/day , assuming nationwide compliance with the 10 microg/L U.S. drinking water standard .	
17346867-3	Intakes for children were slightly lower ( 3.5 and 5.9 microg/day ) .	
17346867-4	Based on the current EPA cancer slope factor for arsenic , estimated lifetime risks associated with background diet and water at the mean and 90th percentile are 1 per 10,000 and 2 per 10,000 , respectively .	
17346867-5	By comparison , reasonable maximum risks for arsenic in soil at 20 ( higher typical background level ) and 100mg/kg are 4 per 100,000 and 2 per 10,000 , using EPA default exposure assumptions .	245 24 2
17346867-6	EPA reasonable maximum estimates of arsenic exposure from residential use of treated wood are likewise within background intakes .	24 244 2
17346867-7	These examples provide context on how predicted risks compare to typical exposures within the U.S. population , thereby providing perspective for risk communication and regulatory decision-making on arsenic in the environment and in consumer products .	
16730400-0	By use of a Swedish Market basket study from 1999 , in which foods were sampled from four regions , the dietary intake of persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) was assessed .	24 2 243
16730400-1	Based on earlier data , six food groups ( fish , meat , dairy products , egg , fats/oils , and pastries ; comprising 52 food items ) were selected for POP analyses .	
16730400-2	Homogenates from these six groups were subjected to POP analyses and levels presented on dioxins ( PCDD/PCDFs ) , dioxin-like PCBs , PCB-153 , summation operatorPCBs , BDE-47 , summation operatorPBDEs , DDE , summation operatorDDTs , HCB , summation operatorHCHs , and summation operatorchlordanes , after adjusting non-quantified levels to 1/2 LOQ .	
16730400-3	For all compounds , the fish homogenate contained the comparatively highest levels , on a fresh weight basis .	
16730400-4	Intake calculations based on the six food groups showed that summation operatorPCBs and summation operatorDDTs gave per capita intakes of 615 and 523 ng/day , respectively , that the estimated summation operatorPBDE intake was 51 ng/day and that of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs was 96 pg WHO-TEQ/day .	24 2 243
16730400-5	The estimated mean intakes were below ( total-TEQ : 1.3 pg/kgbw/day ) or well below ( summation operatorDDTs : 8.9 ng/kgbw/day ) internationally agreed intake limits ( total-TEQ : 2 pg/kgbw/day ; summation operatorDDTs : 10,000 ng/kgbw/day ) .	2
16730400-6	A number of uncertainty factors , including analytical limitations due to low POP levels in food , give reason for caution in the use of the presented intake data .	
16730400-7	However , the intake estimations of dioxins , summation operatorPCBs and summation operatorPBDEs are well in accordance to calculations of POP intakes in Sweden made by alternate methods .	
22572118-0	This first study of trihalomethanes ( THMs ) in swimming pools using bromine agents for water disinfection under real conditions shows that the mixtures of these compounds are largely dominated by bromoform in a similar process as chloroform becomes the dominant THM in pools disinfected with chlorine agents .	
22572118-1	Bromoform largely predominates in air and water of the pool installations whose concentration changes are linearly correlated .	
22572118-2	However , the air concentrations of bromoform account for about 6-11% of the expected concentrations according to theoretical partitioning defined by the Henry law .	2 23
22572118-3	Bromoform in exhaled air of swimmers is correlated with the air concentrations of this disinfectant by-product in the pool building .	12 23 1 2 125 232
22572118-4	Comparison of the THM exhaled air concentrations between swimmers and volunteers bathing in the water without swimming or standing in the building outside the water suggest that physical activity enhance exposure to these disinfectant by-products .	1 12 125
22572118-5	They also indicate that in swimming pools , besides inhalation , dermal absorption is a relevant route for the incorporation of THMs , particularly those with lower degree of bromination .	
21788061-0	Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans ( PCDD/Fs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( DL-PCBs ) were measured by high resolution gas chromatograph/high resolution mass spectrometer ( HRGC/HRMS ) in six food groups from Luqiao ( LQ ) where the e-waste has been recycled and from Yuhang ( YH ) where the agriculture dominates in Zhejiang Province in China .	
21788061-1	The total WHO-TEQ values of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in selected foods from LQ were significantly much higher than those from YH .	
21788061-2	The highest level of the total WHO-TEQ was in crucian carp ( 10.87 pg g(-1) w.w. ) followed by duck ( 3.77 pg g(-1) w.w. ) , hen eggs ( 2.80 pg g(-1) w.w. ) , chicken ( 2.43 pg g(-1) w.w. ) , rice ( 0.08 pg g(-1) w.w. ) and vegetables ( 0.022 pg g(-1) w.w. ) in LQ .	
21788061-3	By contrast , the highest levels were measured in duck ( 0.74 pg g(-1) w.w. ) followed by hen eggs ( 0.69 pg g(-1) w.w. ) , crucian carp ( 0.55 pg g(-1) w.w. ) , chicken ( 0.44 pg g(-1) w.w. ) , vegetables ( 0.002 pg g(-1) w.w. ) and rice ( 0.0002 pg g(-1) w.w. ) in YH , respectively .	
21788061-4	The monthly intake of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs for the local residents was 401.75 pg WHO-TEQ g(-1) w.w. in LQ , which is above the provisional tolerable monthly intake ( PTMI ) set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA ) .	2
21788061-5	We determined a monthly intake of 37.13 pg WHO-TEQ g(-1)w.w. in YH , which is below the PTMI .	2
21788061-6	Crucian carp was the predominant contributor to the estimated monthly intake ( EMI ) , accounting for 67.74% and 36.51% in LQ and YH , respectively .	24 2 243
21788061-7	High levels of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in selected foods indicate severe contamination of these pollutants in the e-waste recycling site .	
17365626-0	This study examined the difference between sulfhydryl-reactive metals ( mercury , lead , arsenic , and cadmium ) in the hair of 45 children with autism ( 1-6 yr of age ) as compared to 45 gender- , age- , and race-matched typical children .	1 12 123
17365626-1	Hair samples were measured with inductively coupled mass spectrometry .	1 123 12
17365626-2	Some studies , such as Holmes et al .	
17365626-3	( 2003 ) , suggested that children with autism may be poor detoxifiers relative to normally developing children .	
17365626-4	Metals that are not eliminated sequester in the brain .	
17365626-5	Our study found that arsenic , cadmium , and lead were significantly lower in the hair of children with autism than in matched controls .	1 12 123
17365626-6	Mercury was in the same direction ( lower in autism ) following the same pattern , but did not achieve statistical significance .	
17365626-7	The evidence from our study supports the notion that children with autism may have trouble excreting these metals , resulting in a higher body burden that may contribute to symptoms of autism .	
22562770-0	BACKGROUND Maternal factors are implicated in the onset of childhood asthma .	
22562770-1	Differentiation of naÃ¯ve CD4+ T lymphocytes into pro-allergic T-helper 2 cells induces interleukin ( IL)4 expression and inhibits interferon ( IFN)Î³ expression accompanied by concordant methylation changes in the promoters of these genes .	
22562770-2	However , it has yet to be established whether maternal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) can alter these gene promoters epigenetically during fetal development .	
22562770-3	OBJECTIVES In this study we sought to elucidate the relationship between maternal PAH exposure and promoter methylation status of IFNÎ³ and IL4 .	1111 1 111 11
22562770-4	METHODS We assessed the effects of benzo[a]pyrene ( BaP ) , a representative airborne PAH , on the methylation status of the IFNÎ³ and IL4 promoters in Jurkat cells and two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines , and on gene expression .	
22562770-5	In addition , we evaluated methylation status of the IFNÎ³ promoter in cord white blood cells from 53 participants in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health cohort .	
22562770-6	Maternal PAH exposure was estimated by personal air monitoring during pregnancy .	23 2 233
22562770-7	RESULTS In vitro exposure of the cell models to low , noncytotoxic doses ( 0.1 and 1 nM ) of BaP elicited increased promoter hypermethylation and reduced expression of IFNÎ³ , but not IL4 .	
22562770-8	IFNÎ³ promoter methylation in cord white blood cells was associated with maternal PAH exposure in the cohort study subsample .	
22562770-9	CONCLUSION Consistent with the results for the cell lines , maternal exposure to PAHs was associated with hypermethylation of IFNÎ³ in cord blood DNA from cohort children .	
22562770-10	These findings support a potential role of epigenetics in fetal reprogramming by PAH-induced environmental diseases .	
22541720-0	Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity .	2 23
22541720-1	This adverse health effect is suggested to be mediated by inflammatory processes .	
22541720-2	The purpose of this study was to determine if low levels of particulate matter , typical for smaller cities , are associated with acute systemic inflammation .	
22541720-3	Fifty-two elderly individuals with ischemic heart disease were followed for six months with biweekly clinical visits in the city of Kotka , Finland .	
22541720-4	Blood samples were collected for the determination of inflammatory markers interleukin ( IL)-1Î² , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , interferon ( IFN)Î³ , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , fibrinogen , myeloperoxidase and white blood cell count .	11 12 1113 1 122 11123 111 1112
22541720-5	Particle number concentration and fine particle ( particles with aerodynamic diameters &lt;2.5 Î¼m ( PM(2.5)) ) as well as thoracic particle ( particles with aerodynamic diameters &lt;10 Î¼m ( PM(10)) ) mass concentration were measured daily at a fixed outdoor measurement site .	2 231 23
22541720-6	Light-absorbance of PM(2.5) filter samples , an indicator of combustion derived particles , was measured with a smoke-stain reflectometer .	
22541720-7	In addition , personal exposure to PM(2.5) was measured with portable photometers .	2 233 23
22541720-8	During the study period , wildfires in Eastern Europe led to a 12-day air pollution episode , which was excluded from the main analyses .	
22541720-9	Average ambient PM(2.5) concentration was 8.7 Î¼g/m(3) .	2 23
22541720-10	Of the studied pollutants , PM(2.5) and absorbance were most strongly associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers ; most notably with C-reactive protein and IL-12 within a few days of exposure .	
22541720-11	There was also some evidence of an effect of particulate air pollution on fibrinogen and myeloperoxidase .	
22541720-12	The concentration of IL-12 was considerably ( 227% ) higher during than before the forest fire episode .	
22541720-13	These findings show that even low levels of particulate air pollution from urban sources are associated with acute systemic inflammation .	
22541720-14	Also particles from wildfires may exhibit pro-inflammatory effects .	
16736056-0	Previous research demonstrated consistent associations between ambient air pollution and emergency room visits , hospitalizations , and mortality .	
16736056-1	Effect of air pollution on perinatal outcomes has recently drawn more attention .	
16736056-2	We examined the association between intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) among singleton term live births and sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , ozone ( O3 ) , and fine particles ( PM2.5 ) present in ambient air in the Canadian cities of Calgary , Edmonton , and Montreal for the period 1985-2000 .	2 231 23
16736056-3	Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for IUGR , based on average daily levels of individual pollutants over each month and trimester of pregnancy after adjustment for maternal age , parity , infant gender , season , and city of residence .	2 231 23
16736056-4	A 1 ppm increase in CO was associated with an increased risk of IUGR in the first ( OR=1.18 ; 95% CI 1.14-1.23 ) , second ( OR=1.15 ; 95% CI 1.10-1.19 ) and third ( OR=1.19 ; 95% CI 1.14-1.24 ) trimesters of pregnancy , respectively .	
16736056-5	A 20 ppb increase in NO2 ( OR=1.16 ; 95% CI 1.09-1.24 ; OR=1.14 ; 95% CI 1.06--1.21 ; and OR=1.16 ; 95% CI 1.09-1.24 in the first , second , and third trimesters ) and a 10 mug/m3 increase in PM2.5 ( OR=1.07 ; 95% CI 1.03-1.10 ; OR=1.06 ; 95% CI 1.03-1.10 ; and OR=1.06 ; 95% CI 1.03-1.10 ) were also associated with an increased risk of IUGR .	
16736056-6	Consistent results were found when ORs were calculated by month rather than trimester of pregnancy .	
16736056-7	Our findings add to the emerging body of evidence that exposure to relatively low levels of ambient air pollutants in urban areas during pregnancy is associated with adverse effects on fetal growth .	11 23 1 2 112 231
21767864-0	BACKGROUND Environmental contaminants have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity .	
21767864-1	OBJECTIVE To explore relations between persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) and fat mass independently of body stature , using a cross-sectional design .	
21767864-2	METHODS In the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors ( PIVUS ) , fat mass was determined in 70-year-old subjects ( n=890 ) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) .	1 11 112
21767864-3	The plasma levels of 21 POPs ( including 16 PCB congeners , 3 OC pesticides , 1 BDE47 , and 1 dioxin ) were measured by high resolution chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry ( HRGC/HRMS ) .	1 122 12
21767864-4	RESULTS Lipid-standardized plasma concentrations of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( OCDD ) , the PCBs 74 , 99 , 105 and 118 , and the pesticides HCB , TNK , and DDE were all positively related to fat mass ( p=0.03-0.0001 ) .	1 11 112
21767864-5	Subjects in the fifth quintile for PCB 105 showed a mean fat mass that was 4.8 kg more than subjects in the first quintile .	
21767864-6	On the other hand , the PCBs 156 , 157 , 169 , 170 , 180 , 189 , 194 , 206 , and 209 were negatively related to fat mass ( p=0.0001 ) .	
21767864-7	For PCB 194 , subjects in the fifth quintile showed a mean fat mass that was 10.8 kg less than subjects in the first quintile .	
21767864-8	Following adjustment for smoking , physical activity , education level , height , lean mass , and gender , these results remained significant ( p=0.01-0.0001 ) except for the PCBs 74 and 99 .	
21767864-9	For some PCBs , the associations vs. fat mass were more pronounced in women than in men .	
21767864-10	CONCLUSION Plasma concentrations of some pesticides are positively related to fat mass , while divergent associations are seen for the PCBs .	1 122 12
21767864-11	These results implicate a complex role of POPs in obesity .	
22516208-0	Residential concentrations of formaldehyde have been associated with poor respiratory health in children , where formaldehyde has been measured using stationary monitors inside homes .	2 232 23
22516208-1	Although children spend most of their time indoors at home , there are few studies of children's personal exposure to formaldehyde .	23 2 233
22516208-2	The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between personal exposure formaldehyde concentrations , microenvironmental concentrations and time weighted exposure estimates in children .	2 232 23
22516208-3	Forty-one primary school children ( aged between 9 and 12 years ) wore a personal passive sampler over two 24h periods in two seasons and completed 24h daily activity diaries and a questionnaire about lifestyle and behaviour .	23 2 233
22516208-4	Samplers were co located indoors at home , outdoors at centralised locations and indoors at school for the corresponding period .	2 232 23
22516208-5	Personal exposure formaldehyde concentrations in this group of children were generally low with a geometric mean concentration of 9.1 ppb ( range &lt;detection limit to 27.3 ppb ) .	23 2 233
22516208-6	There were strong correlations between personal exposure concentrations and both domestic indoor ( r(s)=.779 , p&lt;0.001 ) and time weighted estimated ( r(s)=.802 , p&lt;0.001 ) concentrations .	
22516208-7	The time weighted model did not improve the estimate of personal exposure compared with stationary indoor concentrations .	2 233 232 23
22516208-8	Indoor air concentration measured with a single stationary monitor was a suitable surrogate for personal exposure .	2 232 23
16736060-0	Commercial fishers are exposed to unburned hydrocarbon vapors and combustion products present in the emissions from their boat engines .	
16736060-1	The objective of this study was to measure personal exposure to benzene as a marker of fuel exposure , and to predict exposure levels across categories of carbureted two-stroke , four-stroke and diesel engines .	2 233 23
16736060-2	A self-monitoring approach , employing passive monitors , was used to obtain measurements of personal exposure to benzene over time .	2 233 23
16736060-3	Mixed-effect linear regression models were used to predict exposure levels , identify significant effects and determine restricted maximum likelihood estimates for within- and between-person variance components .	
16736060-4	Significant fixed effects for engine type and refueling a car or truck were identified .	
16736060-5	After controlling for refueling , predicted benzene exposure levels to fishers on boats equipped with two-stroke , four-stroke and diesel engines were 58.4 , 38.9 and 15.7 microg/m3 , respectively .	
16736060-6	The logged within-person variance component was 1.43 , larger than the between-person variance component of 1.13 , indicating that the total variation may be attributable to monitor placement , environmental conditions and other factors that change over time as well as differences between individual work practices .	23 2 233
16736060-7	The health consequences of exposure to marine engine emissions are not known .	
16736060-8	The predicted levels are well below those at which health effects have been attributed , however .	
17435204-0	OBJECTIVE To reveal the inter-relationship between nutritional status and arsenic toxicity .	
17435204-1	DESIGN Cross-sectional study .	
17435204-2	SETTING A survey in an area of lowland Nepal , where a high prevalence of both skin manifestation and malnutrition was observed .	
17435204-3	Daily arsenic intake was estimated by measuring the arsenic concentration and daily consumption of the drinking water .	24 2 241
17435204-4	PARTICIPANTS Adult villagers ( 248 men and 291 women ) .	
17435204-5	About half were classified as " underweight " ( body mass index &lt;18.5 ) , indicating poor nutritional status .	
17435204-6	MAIN RESULTS Arsenic intake was negatively correlated with body mass index and substantially increased the prevalence of underweight individuals , among whom the prevalence of skin manifestations was 1.65-fold higher than normal weight individuals .	1 11 112
17435204-7	When exposure level was considered , the prevalence of skin symptoms was consistently higher in the underweight than in the normal group .	
17435204-8	Although enhanced susceptibility in men was apparent by the increased prevalence of cutaneous symptoms , no sex difference was observed in the prevalence of underweight individuals related with exposure to arsenic .	
17435204-9	CONCLUSIONS The present data suggested that exposure to arsenic is associated with an increased prevalence of underweight , a serious health problem in developing countries , which in turn is associated with increased skin manifestation of arsenic poisoning .	
22440811-0	BACKGROUND Airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) are widespread urban air pollutants from fossil fuel burning and other combustion sources .	
22440811-1	We previously reported that a broad spectrum of combustion-related DNA adducts in cord blood was associated with attention problems at 6-7 years of age in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health ( CCCEH ) longitudinal cohort study .	
22440811-2	OBJECTIVES We evaluated the relationship between behavioral problems and two different measures of prenatal exposure--both specific to PAH--in the same cohort .	
22440811-3	METHODS Children of nonsmoking African-American and Dominican women in New York City ( NYC ) were followed from in utero to 6-7 years .	
22440811-4	Prenatal PAH exposure was estimated by personal air monitoring of the mothers during pregnancy as well as by the measurement of DNA adducts specific to benzo[a]pyrene ( BaP ) , a representative PAH , in maternal and cord blood .	12 23 1 122 2 233
22440811-5	At 6-7 years of age , child behavior was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) ( n = 253 ) .	
22440811-6	Generalized linear models were used to test the association between prenatal PAH exposure and behavioral outcomes .	
22440811-7	RESULTS In multivariate analyses , high prenatal PAH exposure , whether characterized by personal air monitoring ( greater than the median of 2.27 ng/mÂ³ ) or maternal and cord adducts ( detectable or higher ) , was positively associated with symptoms of Anxious/Depressed and Attention Problems ( p â¤ 0.05 ) .	11 23 1 2 112 233
22440811-8	CONCLUSION These results provide additional evidence that environmental levels of PAH encountered in NYC air can adversely affect child behavior .	
21763389-0	The aim of this work was to assess the risk due to mercury ( Hg ) , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) and non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( ndl PCBs ) intake via fish consumption in Serbia .	24 2 243
21763389-1	We have developed 24 scenarios using four concentration levels ( mean , maximum , 50th and 95th percentile ) of contaminants , determined in 521 samples of fish products available on Serbian market ; two consumption levels ( Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization data and recommendation of American Heart Association ) ; and three body weights ( 5th , 50th and 95th percentile ) .	24 2 243
21763389-2	All the values concerning the intake of DDT are below the corresponding health based guidance value .	
21763389-3	Calculated weekly intake of Hg using maximal concentration , intake of 340g/week and 5th percentile of body weight exceeded the provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI ) .	24 2 243
21763389-4	When maximal and 95th percentile concentration of ndl PCBs was used , weekly intakes exceeded a " guidance value " with one exception i.e. , when 95th percentile of concentration along with 95th percentile of body weight were used .	
21763389-5	Concerning Hg and ndl PCBs , when extreme concentrations were used , HIs exceeded the value of 1 , indicating that fish and fishery products may pose a threat to consumer's health .	
22424646-0	Dental technicians use various materials , particularly metal alloys and monomers and polymers based on methylmethacrylate .	
22424646-1	Environmental hygiene issues surrounding the work of dental technicians have been recognized .	
22424646-2	Despite the need for observance of occupational environmental controls and work management , compliance among dental laboratories appears to be low .	
22424646-3	We evaluated the relationship between genotoxic effects in dental technicians and occupational environmental controls and work management .	
22424646-4	We used cytokinesis-blocked micronuclei ( CB-MN ) frequencies in peripheral lymphocytes and metal levels in scalp hair .	11 1111 12 1 123 111
22424646-5	We also assessed nutritional factors related to anti-genotoxic effects using a self-administered brief diet history questionnaire .	
22424646-6	Study subjects were 54 male dental technicians and 38 male clerical workers .	1 123 12
22424646-7	The parameters on the micronuclei ( MN ) frequency in dental technicians and clerical workers were analyzed by forward stepwise multiple regression analyses .	1111 1 111 11
22424646-8	Age ( P &lt ; 0.01 , Î² = 0.561 ) , occupation as a dental technician ( P &lt ; 0.01 , Î² = 0.636 ) and aluminum levels in scalp hair ( P &lt ; 0.05 , Î² = 0.213 ) were risk factors that significantly increased MN frequency .	
22424646-9	The significant parameters on the MN frequency in dental technicians were observance of hand-washing as work management ( P &lt ; 0.01 , Î² = -0.304 ) , work period ( P &lt ; 0.01 , Î² = 0.509 ) , germanium levels in scalp hair ( P &lt ; 0.01 , Î² = -0.314 ) and workplace ( P &lt ; 0.05 , Î² = 0.235 ) .	
22424646-10	To avoid genotoxic effects , observance of occupational environmental controls and work management is necessary for dental technicians .	
16740414-0	The Human Biological Monitoring ( HBM ) project was launched in the Czech Republic in 1994 as a part of the nation-wide Environmental Health Monitoring System to assess the exposure of the Czech general population to a broad spectrum of environmental contaminants .	
16740414-1	Over the years 2001-2003 , the concentrations of lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , and mercury ( Hg ) were determined in whole blood of 1188 adults ( blood donors ) and 333 children and in urine of 657 adults and 619 children .	1 122 12 127
16740414-2	In adults , the median blood lead ( B-Pb ) level was 33microg/l .	1 122 12
16740414-3	Men had higher B-Pb levels than women ( medians 37microg/l vs. 25microg/l ) .	
16740414-4	Significantly higher B-Pb levels were observed in smokers compared to non-smokers ( 36microg/l vs. 31microg/l ) .	
16740414-5	In children , no sex-dependent differences were observed ( median 31microg/l ) .	
16740414-6	In total , the median blood Cd level ( B-Cd ) in adults was 0.5microg/l .	
16740414-7	Smokers showed a median B-Cd level about 3 times as high as non-smokers ( 1.3microg/l vs. 0.40microg/l ) .	
16740414-8	Neither sex- nor age-related differences were observed in B-Cd levels .	
16740414-9	In 65% of children , B-Cd levels were below the limit of detection ( LOD ) .	
16740414-10	The overall median urinary cadmium level ( U-Cd ) in adults was 0.31microg/g creatinine .	1 12 127
16740414-11	Significantly higher U-Cd levels were found in women ( median 0.39microg/g creatinine ) compared to men ( 0.29microg/g creatinine ) .	
16740414-12	No significant differences were found between smokers and non-smokers .	
16740414-13	In more than 50% of children , the U-Cd level was below the LOD ( =0.2microg/l ) .	
16740414-14	The median blood mercury ( B-Hg ) level in adults was 0.89microg/l .	1 122 12
16740414-15	Significant differences were found between smokers ( 0.80microg/l ) and non-smokers ( 0.92microg/l ) , and between men and women ( 0.86microg/l vs. 0.94microg/l ) .	
16740414-16	The median B-Hg level in children was 0.42microg/l and no sex-related differences were observed .	
16740414-17	The median urinary mercury ( U-Hg ) levels were 0.63microg/g creatinine in adults and 0.37microg/g creatinine in children .	1 12 127
16740414-18	Significantly higher U-Hg levels were obtained in women and non-smokers compared to men and smokers , respectively .	
16740414-19	The B-Pb , B-Hg , U-Cd , and U-Hg levels significantly correlated with age .	
16740414-20	The following reference values were recommended for the period 2001-2003 : 80 , 65 and 55microg/l for B-Pb and 3.1 , 4.0 and 1.5microg/l for B-Hg in men , women and children , respectively ; 1.1microg/l and 1.2microg/g creatinine for B-Cd and U-Cd , respectively , in adult non-smokers ; 5.4 and 12.0microg/g creatinine for U-Hg in men and women , respectively , and 3.7 and 5.5microg/g creatinine for U-Hg in boys and girls , respectively .	
16740414-21	The previous reference values for B-Pb and B-Cd needed revision and were reduced .	
16750524-0	The Children's Total Exposure to Persistent Pesticides and Other Persistent Organic Pollutants ( CTEPP ) study investigated the potential exposures of 257 preschool children , ages 1 1/2-5 yr , and their primary adult caregivers to more than 50 anthropogenic chemicals .	
16750524-1	Field sampling took place in selected counties in North Carolina ( NC ) and Ohio ( OH ) in 2000-2001 .	
16750524-2	Over a 48-h period in each child's daycare center and/or home , food , beverages , indoor air , outdoor air , house dust , soil , participants ' hand surfaces and urine were sampled .	24 245 12 23 242 1 2 243 127 232
16750524-3	Additional samples-transferable residues , food preparation surface wipes , and hard floor surface wipes-were collected in the approximately 13% of the homes that had pesticide applications within the 7 days prior to field sampling .	24 2 242
16750524-4	Three phenols were among the measured chemicals : pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) , bisphenol-A [ 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane ] , and nonylphenol ( 4-n-nonylphenol ) .	
16750524-5	Nonylphenol ( NP ) was detected in less than 11% of the samples in any medium .	
16750524-6	Among samples that were collected at all participants ' homes and daycare centers , PCP was detected in &gt;50% of indoor air , outdoor air , house dust , and urine samples ; bisphenol-A ( BPA ) was detected in &gt;50% of indoor air , hand wipe , solid food , and liquid food samples .	24 12 23 242 1 2 243 127 232
16750524-7	The concentrations of the phenols in the sampled media were measured , and the children's potential exposures and potential absorbed doses resulting from intake through the inhalation , dietary ingestion , and indirect ingestion routes of exposure were estimated .	24 2 232 243 23
16750524-8	The children's potential exposures to PCP were predominantly through inhalation : 78% in NC and 90% in OH .	2 232 23
16750524-9	In contrast , their potential exposures to BPA were predominantly through dietary ingestion : 99% , for children in both states .	24 2 243
16750524-10	The children's estimated exposures to PCP , calculated from the amounts excreted in their urine , exceeded their estimated maximum potential intake , calculated from the multimedia PCP concentrations , by a factor greater than 10 .	1 2 12 21 127
16750524-11	This inconsistency for PCP highlights the need for further research on the environmental pathways and routes of PCP exposure , investigation of possible exposures to other compounds that could be metabolized to PCP , and on the human absorption , metabolism , and excretion of this phenol over time periods longer than 48 h .	
17453740-0	Epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent mechanisms have been implicated in growth signal transduction pathways that contribute to cancer development , including dermal carcinogenesis .	
17453740-1	Detection of the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ECD ) in serum has been suggested as a potential biomarker for monitoring this effect in vivo .	11 1 11123 111 1112
17453740-2	Arsenic is a known human carcinogen , producing skin and other malignancies in populations exposed through their drinking water .	
17453740-3	One such exposed population , which we have been studying for a number of years , is in Bangladesh .	
17453740-4	The purpose of this study was to examine the EGFR ECD as a potential biomarker of arsenic exposure and/or effect in this population .	
17453740-5	Levels of the EGFR ECD were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum samples from 574 individuals with a range of arsenic exposures from drinking water in the Araihazar area of Bangladesh .	24 2 241
17453740-6	In multiple regression analysis , serum EGFR ECD was found to be positively associated with three different measures of arsenic exposure ( well water arsenic , urinary arsenic and a cumulative arsenic index ) at statistically significant levels ( p&lt;or=0.034 ) , and this association was strongest among the individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions ( p &lt;or= 0.002 ) .	11 24 12 127 1 2 241 112
17453740-7	When the study subjects were stratified in tertiles of serum EGFR ECD levels , the risk of skin lesions increased progressively for each increase in all three arsenic measures ( also stratified in tertiles ) and this increasing risk became more pronounced among subjects within the highest tertile of EGFR ECD levels .	
17453740-8	These results suggest that serum EGFR ECD levels may be a potential biomarker of effect of arsenic exposure and may indicate those exposed individuals at greatest risk for the development of arsenic-induced skin lesions .	11 1
17474575-0	One of the leading positions on the world's list of harmful substances is taken by cadmium , which is a heavy metal .	
17474575-1	Cadmium ( Cd ) gets into the human body through either respiratory tract ( cigarette smoke ) or alimentary canal .	
17474575-2	The aim of the study was to 1 ) determine whether the concentrations of cadmium in blood and urine of children from Katowice Murcki--one of the cleanest districts of the town - as well as its contents in the hair of the children exceeds acceptable values and 2 ) to analyse the effect of chosen environmental factors ( exposition to smoke , parents ' education ) on the amount of cadmium in these materials .	1 122 12 127 123
17474575-3	The study comprised 48 children at the age from 9-11 years from Katowice Murcki , attending the same primary school .	
17474575-4	The findings were statistically analysed using Shapiro-Wilk and Wilcoxon test .	
17474575-5	Concentration of cadmium in the blood was 0.479 microg/l , in urine 0.840 microg/g creatinine and the average concentration in the hair constituted 0.23 microg/g drymass .	1 122 12 127 123
17474575-6	Concentration of cadmium in the blood of 13 children ( 30.95% ) exceeded acceptable 0.5 microg/l value , while in 10 children ( 23.25% ) value in the urine was exceeded .	1 122 12 127
17474575-7	It was lug/g creatinine .	
17474575-8	It has been shown that children who lived nearby motorway presented higher content of cadmium in the hair .	1 123 12
17474575-9	Environmental factors such as : location of the road and intensity of traffic influence the content of cadmium in the human body .	
21742576-0	BACKGROUND Several reports indicate that drinking water arsenic ( WAs ) and manganese ( WMn ) are associated with children's intellectual function .	
21742576-1	Very little is known , however , about possible associations with other neurologic outcomes such as motor function .	
21742576-2	METHODS We investigated the associations of WAs and WMn with motor function in 304 children in Bangladesh , 8-11 years of age .	24 11 12 112 1 122 123 241 127 2
21742576-3	We measured As and Mn concentrations in drinking water , blood , urine , and toenails .	24 12 1 122 123 241 127 2
21742576-4	We assessed motor function with the Bruininks-Oseretsky test , version 2 , in four subscales-fine manual control ( FMC ) , manual coordination ( MC ) , body coordination ( BC ) , and strength and agility-which can be summarized with a total motor composite score ( TMC ) .	1 11 112
21742576-5	REsults : Log-transformed blood As was associated with decreases in TMC [ Î² = -3.63 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : -6.72 , -0.54 ; p &lt ; 0.01 ] , FMC ( Î² = -1.68 ; 95% CI : -3.19 , -0.18 ; p &lt ; 0.05 ) , and BC ( Î² = -1.61 ; 95% CI : -2.72 , -0.51 ; p &lt ; 0.01 ) , with adjustment for sex , school attendance , head circumference , mother's intelligence , plasma ferritin , and blood Mn , lead , and selenium .	1 122 12
21742576-6	Other measures of As exposure ( WAs , urinary As , and toenail As ) also were inversely associated with motor function scores , particularly TMC and BC .	11 12 112 1 123 127
21742576-7	Square-transformed blood selenium was positively associated with TMC ( Î² = 3.54 ; 95% CI : 1.10 , 6.0 ; p &lt ; 0.01 ) , FMC ( Î² = 1.55 ; 95% CI : 0.40 , 2.70 ; p &lt ; 0.005 ) , and MC ( Î² = 1.57 ; 95% CI : 0.60 , 2.75 ; p &lt ; 0.005 ) in the unadjusted models .	
21742576-8	Mn exposure was not significantly associated with motor function .	
21742576-9	CONCLUSION Our research demonstrates an adverse association of As exposure and a protective association of Se on motor function in children .	
18008001-0	BACKGROUND Evidence for environmental causes of asthma is limited , especially among African Americans .	
18008001-1	To look for systematic differences in early life domestic exposures between inner-city preschool children with and without asthma , we performed a study of home indoor air pollutants and allergens .	2 232 23
18008001-2	METHODS Children 2-6 years of age were enrolled in a cohort study in East Baltimore , Maryland .	
18008001-3	From the child's bedroom , air was monitored for 3 days for particulate matter &lt;or= 2.5 and &lt;or= 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM(2.5) , PM(10) ) , nitrogen dioxide , and ozone .	2 232 23
18008001-4	Median baseline values were compared for children with ( n = 150 ) and without ( n = 150 ) asthma .	
18008001-5	Housing characteristics related to indoor air pollution were assessed by caregiver report and home inspection .	2 232 23
18008001-6	In addition , indoor allergen levels were measured in settled dust .	24 2 242
18008001-7	RESULTS Children were 58% male , 91% African American , and 88% with public health insurance .	
18008001-8	Housing characteristics related to pollutant exposure and bedroom air pollutant concentrations did not differ significantly between asthmatic and control subjects [ median : PM(2.5) , 28.7 vs. 28.5 microg/m(3) ; PM(10) , 43.6 vs. 41.4 microg/m(3) ; NO(2) , 21.6 vs. 20.9 ppb ; O(3) , 1.4 vs. 1.8 ppb ; all p &gt ; 0.05 ] .	2 232 23
18008001-9	Settled dust allergen levels ( cat , dust mite , cockroach , dog , and mouse ) were also similar in bedrooms of asthmatic and control children .	24 2 242
18008001-10	CONCLUSIONS Exposures to common home indoor pollutants and allergens are similar for inner-city preschool children with and without asthma .	2 232 23
18008001-11	Although these exposures may exacerbate existing asthma , this study does not support a causative role of these factors for risk of developing childhood asthma .	
16759980-0	High cadmium exposure is known to cause bone damage , but the association between low-level cadmium exposure and osteoporosis remains to be clarified .	
16759980-1	Using a population-based women's health survey in southern Sweden [ Women's Health in the Lund Area ( WHILA ) ] with no known historical cadmium contamination , we investigated cadmium-related effects on bone in 820 women ( 53-64 years of age ) .	
16759980-2	We measured cadmium in blood and urine and lead in blood , an array of markers of bone metabolism , and forearm bone mineral density ( BMD ) .	11 12 112 1 122 127
16759980-3	Associations were evaluated in multiple linear regression analysis including information on the possible confounders or effect modifiers : weight , menopausal status , use of hormone replacement therapy , age at menarche , alcohol consumption , smoking history , and physical activity .	
16759980-4	Median urinary cadmium was 0.52 microg/L adjusted to density ( 0.67 microg/g creatinine ) .	1 12 127
16759980-5	After multivariate adjustment , BMD , parathyroid hormone , and urinary deoxypyridinoline ( U-DPD ) were adversely associated with concentrations of urinary cadmium ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) in all subjects .	11 1 11122 11123 111 1112
16759980-6	These associations persisted in the group of never-smokers , which had the lowest cadmium exposure ( mainly dietary ) .	
16759980-7	For U-DPD , there was a significant interaction between cadmium and menopause ( p = 0.022 ) .	
16759980-8	Our results suggest negative effects of low-level cadmium exposure on bone , possibly exerted via increased bone resorption , which seemed to be intensified after menopause .	
16759980-9	Based on the prevalence of osteoporosis and the low level of exposure , the observed effects , although slight , should be considered as early signals of potentially more adverse health effects .	
16759980-10	Key words : biochemical bone markers , bone mineral density , cadmium , lead , osteoporosis , women .	
17503254-0	Although at high levels arsenic exposure is associated with increased cancer incidence , information on the health effects of lower exposure levels is limited .	
17503254-1	The objective of this study was to determine whether arsenic at concentrations below 40 microg/L in drinking water is associated with increased urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , a biomarker of DNA oxidative damage and repair .	24 1111 1 11122 2 241 1114 11 111 1112
17503254-2	Urine samples were collected from 73 nonsmoking adults residing in two communities in Arizona ( mean tap water arsenic ( microg/L ) 4.0 +/- 2.3 and 20.3 +/- 3.7 ) , and 51 subjects in four communities in Sonora , Mexico ( mean tap water arsenic ( microg/L ) ranging from 4.8 +/- 0.1 to 33.3 +/- 0.6 ) .	24 12 1 2 241 127
17503254-3	Although urinary arsenic concentration increased with higher exposure in tap water , urinary 8-OHdG concentration did not differ by community within Arizona or Sonora , and was not associated with urinary arsenic concentration .	24 12 1 2 241 127
17503254-4	At the exposure levels evaluated in this study , drinking water arsenic was not associated with increased DNA oxidation as measured by urinary 8-OHdG .	24 2 241
16759983-0	Many older homes are equipped with mercury-containing gas regulators that reduce the pressure of natural gas in the mains to the low pressure used in home gas piping .	
16759983-1	Removal of these regulators can result in elemental mercury spills inside the home .	
16759983-2	In the summer of 2000 , mercury spills were discovered in the basements of several Chicago-area homes after removal of gas regulators by gas company contractors .	
16759983-3	Subsequent inspections of approximately 361,000 homes by two northern Illinois gas companies showed that 1,363 homes had residential mercury contamination .	
16759983-4	Urine mercury screening was offered to concerned residents , and results of urine bioassays and indoor mercury air measurements were available for 171 homes .	12 23 1 2 127 232
16759983-5	Six of these 171 homes ( 3.5% ) had a cumulative total of nine residents with a urine mercury &gt ; or = 10 microg/L .	1 12 127
16759983-6	The highest urine mercury concentration observed in a resident was 26 microg/L .	
16759983-7	Positive bioassays were most strongly associated with mercury air concentrations &gt ; 10 microg/m3 on the first floor [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 21.4 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 3.6-125.9 ] rather than in the basement ( OR = 3.0 ; 95% CI , 0.3-26 ) , and first-floor air samples were more predictive of positive bioassays than were basement samples .	2 232 23
16759983-8	Overall , the risk of residential mercury contamination after gas regulator removal ranged from 0.9/1,000 to 4.3/1,000 homes , depending on the gas company , although the risk was considerably higher ( 20 of 120 homes , 16.7% ) for one of the contractors performing removal work for one of the gas companies .	
16759983-9	Gas companies , their contractors , and residents should be aware of these risks and should take appropriate actions to prevent these spills from occurring and remediate them if they occur .	
21724230-0	A study was conducted to evaluate the association between PCBs in residential indoor air and in the serum of older , long time residents of three upper Hudson River communities .	
21724230-1	Samples of indoor air and of serum were collected from 170 persons 55 to 74 years of age , and analyzed for PCBs using glass capillary gas chromatography .	12 23 1 122 2 232
21724230-2	After adjusting for age , BMI , cigarette smoking , and Hudson River fish consumption with multiple linear regression analysis , the results indicated statistically significant associations between concentrations in indoor air and serum for PCB-28 , a lightly chlorinated congener common in air that accumulates in serum , and PCB-105 .	12 23 1 122 2 232
21724230-3	Duration of exposure was an important factor , since among persons who had lived in their home for 39 years or more , 11 of the 12 most commonly detected congeners were significantly correlated , as was their sum ( â PCB ) .	
21724230-4	Significant associations between indoor air and serum PCB concentrations also were more likely when collected in cooler months and if the two samples were collected within 20 d of each other .	
21724230-5	The study is among the first to indicate that PCB concentrations characteristic of residential indoor air are associated with a detectable increase in body burden .	2 232 23
16765413-0	Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) are among the most toxic environmental pollutants .	
16765413-1	Food , especially animal based , has been described as the major source for human exposure to PCBs .	
16765413-2	We investigated PCB levels ( congeners 10 , 28 , 52 , 153 , 138 , and 180 ) in cheese from 14 cities of Rio Grande do Sul , Brazil .	
16765413-3	The fat was extracted using sodium sulfate and petroleum ether , and PCBs purification was conducted using florisil and hexane .	
16765413-4	The identification and quantification were made in a gas chromatograph with microelectron capture detector ( GC-microECD ) .	
16765413-5	PCB congeners were found ( lower bound data as ngg(-1) fat ) in the following rank : 52 ( 15.75)&gt;180 ( 4.91)&gt;28 ( 3.43)&gt;153 ( 3.00)&gt;10 ( 2.38)&gt;138 ( 1.37 ) .	
16765413-6	Summation operatorPCB contamination ranged from 0 to 78.32 ngg(-1) fat .	
16765413-7	Differences in PCB levels between industrialized ( 33.32 ngg(-1) fat ) and homemade ( 26.58 ngg(-1) fat ) cheese and between two different regions ( 36.19 vs. 26.95 ngg(-1) fat ) were not statistically significant .	
16765413-8	For university students , the estimated daily intake ( EDI ) of PCBs from cheese ranged from 0 to 3.13 pgkg(-1) b.w .	24 2 243
16765413-9	EDI was significantly higher for industrialized than homemade cheese , and for cheese from Mountain/Porto Alegre region than from Santa Maria/South/Western region .	
16765413-10	No sample exceeded maximum level of PCBs allowed in dairy products in the European Community .	
17565158-0	BACKGROUND Region II of Chile ( the second most northerly administrative region ) experienced dramatic increases in average arsenic water concentrations beginning in 1958 , followed by marked declines in the 1970s when water treatment plants were installed .	24 2 241
17565158-1	This history provides a unique opportunity to study time trends in the development of arsenic-related cancers , including lung and bladder cancers .	
17565158-2	METHODS We investigated lung and bladder cancer mortality from 1950 to 2000 for region II compared with region V , where drinking water was not contaminated with arsenic .	24 2 241
17565158-3	Mortality data were obtained from 218,174 death certificates for the two regions for 1950-1970 and from mortality data tapes that identified 307,541 deaths in the two regions for 1971-2000 .	
17565158-4	Poisson regression models were used to identify time trends in rate ratios ( RRs ) of mortality from lung and bladder cancers comparing region II with region V. RESULTS Lung and bladder cancer mortality rate ratios for region II compared with region V started to increase about 10 years after high arsenic exposures commenced and continued to rise until peaking in 1986-1997 .	
17565158-5	The peak lung cancer mortality RRs were 3.61 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 3.13 to 4.16 ) for men and 3.26 ( 95% CI = 2.50 to 4.23 ) for women .	
17565158-6	The peak bladder cancer RRs were 6.10 ( 95% CI = 3.97 to 9.39 ) for men and 13.8 ( 95% CI = 7.74 to 24.5 ) for women .	
17565158-7	Combined lung and bladder cancer mortality rates in region II were highest in the period 1992-1994 , with mortality rates of 153 and 50 per 100,000 men and women , respectively , in region II compared with 54 and 19 per 100,000 in region V. CONCLUSIONS Such large increases in total population cancer mortality rates have , to our knowledge , not been documented for any other environmental exposure .	
17565158-8	The long latency pattern is noteworthy , with mortality from lung and bladder cancers continuing to be high until the late 1990s , even though major decreases in arsenic exposure occurred more than 25 years earlier .	
17336003-0	Aggregate ( multiple pathway ) exposures to methyl tertiary-butyl ether ( MTBE ) in air and water occur via dermal , inhalation , and oral routes .	
17336003-1	Previously , physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) models have been used to quantify the kinetic behavior of MTBE and its primary metabolite , tertiary-butyl alcohol ( TBA ) , from inhalation exposures .	2 21
17336003-2	However , the contribution of dermal and oral exposures to the internal dose of MTBE and TBA were not characterized well .	
17336003-3	The objective of this study was to develop a multi-route PBPK model of MTBE and TBA in humans .	2 21
17336003-4	The model was based entirely on blood MTBE and TBA measurements from controlled human exposures .	
17336003-5	The PBPK model consists of nine primary compartments representing the lungs , skin , fat , kidney , stomach , intestine , liver , rapidly perfused tissue , and slowly perfused tissue .	
17336003-6	The MTBE and TBA models are linked by a single metabolic pathway .	
17336003-7	Although the general structure of the model is similar to previously published models of volatile organic compounds , we have now developed a detailed mathematical description of the lung , skin , and gastrointestinal tract .	
17336003-8	This PBPK model represents the most comprehensive and accurate description of MTBE and TBA pharmacokinetics in humans to date .	
17336003-9	The aggregate exposure model application for MTBE can be generalized to other environmental chemicals under this framework given appropriate empirical measurement data .	
17579961-0	A simple and rapid procedure for measuring total mercury in human hair was evaluated and compared with a conventional technique .	
17579961-1	An Advanced Mercury Analyzer ( AMA-254 ) based on sample catalytic combustion , preconcentration by gold amalgamation , thermal desorption , and atomic absorption spectrometry ( AAS ) ( Comb-AAS ) was assessed for the direct determination of milligram quantities of human hair .	
17579961-2	Precision ( % relative standard deviation ) was &lt ; 7% and accuracy was determined by using two human hair reference materials ( i.e. , NIES No. 13 and IAEA-086 ) that were within the certified range .	
17579961-3	In comparison to conventional graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry ( GF-AAS ) , we found that our method obtained statistically equivalent results .	
17579961-4	Because total analysis time per sample was less than 10 min , the Comb-AAS method was in fact much faster than the GF-AAS method .	
17579961-5	In addition , Comb-AAS does not generate waste products and could be mainly useful for the analysis of a large amount of samples .	
17579961-6	Then , the authors suggest that this quick method could be useful for measuring mercury in human hair .	
17579961-7	Therefore , the mercury content in hair for a non-exposed group of children ( n=40 ) living in Spain was evaluated .	1 12 123
17579961-8	The mean and median hair mercury levels for the subjects under study were found to be lower than the value of 1 microg/g , corresponding to the reference dose of 0.1 microg of methylmercury per kilogram body weight set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .	1 123 12
21715243-0	BACKGROUND Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) have been widely used as flame retardants in consumer products and are ubiquitous in residential indoor air and dust .	
21715243-1	However , little is known about exposure in the office environment .	
21715243-2	OBJECTIVES We examined relationships between PBDE concentrations in the office environment and internal exposure using concurrent measurements of PBDEs in serum , handwipes , and office dust .	24 12 1 122 2 242
21715243-3	METHODS We collected serum , dust , and handwipe samples from 31 participants who spent at least 20 hr/week in an office .	24 12 1 122 2 242
21715243-4	We used a questionnaire to collect information about work and personal habits .	
21715243-5	RESULTS We found positive associations between PBDEs in room dust , handwipes ( a measure of personal exposure ) , and serum .	24 12 1 122 2 242
21715243-6	PBDE office dust concentrations were weakly correlated with measurements in handwipes : r = 0.35 ( p = 0.06 ) for pentaBDE ( sum of BDE congeners 28/33 , 47 , 99 , 100 , and 153 ) and 0.33 ( p = 0.07 ) for BDE-209 .	24 2 242
21715243-7	Hand washing also predicted pentaBDE levels in handwipes : low hand-washers had 3.3 times the pentaBDE levels in their handwipes than did high hand-washers ( p = 0.02 ) .	24 2 242
21715243-8	PentaBDE in handwipes predicted pentaBDE levels in serum ( p = 0.03 ) : Serum concentrations in the highest handwipe tertile were on average 3.5 times the lowest handwipe tertile .	1 122 12
21715243-9	The geometric mean concentration of pentaBDEs in serum was 27 ng/g lipid .	
21715243-10	We detected BDE-209 in 20% of serum samples , at levels ranging from &lt ; 4.8 to 9.7 ng/g lipid .	1
21715243-11	CONCLUSION Our research suggests that exposure to pentaBDE in the office environment contributes to pentaBDE body burden , with exposure likely linked to PBDE residues on hands .	
21715243-12	In addition , hand washing may decrease exposure to PBDEs .	
17584808-0	Bangladesh has already experienced the biggest catastrophe in the world due to arsenic contamination of drinking water .	
17584808-1	This study investigates the association of drinking arsenic-contaminated water ( DACW ) with both personal and household characteristics of 9116 household respondents using the household data of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey ( BDHS ) 2004 .	24 2 241
17584808-2	Here DACW means that arsenic level in the drinking water is greater than the permissible limit ( 50 microg/l ) of Bangladesh .	24 2 241
17584808-3	The overall rate of DACW was 7.9% .	
17584808-4	It was found to be significantly associated with education , currently working , and division of Bangladesh , either by cross tabulation or multivariate logistic regression analyses or both .	
17584808-5	Similarly , household characteristics -- namely television , bicycle , materials of the wall and floor , total family members , number of sleeping rooms , and availability of foods -- were significantly associated in bivariate analyses .	
17584808-6	Many household characteristics -- namely electricity , television , wall and floor materials , and number of sleeping rooms -- revealed significant association in the logistic regression analysis when adjusted for age , education and division .	
17584808-7	This study indicates that respondents from Chittagong division and lower socio-economic groups ( indicated by household characteristics ) are at significantly higher risk of DACW .	
17584808-8	These findings should be taken into account during the planning of future intervention activities in Bangladesh .	
21715241-0	BACKGROUND Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are chemical additives used as flame retardants in commercial products .	
21715241-1	PBDEs are bioaccumulative and persistent and have been linked to several adverse health outcomes .	
21715241-2	OBJECTIVES This study leverages an ongoing pregnancy cohort to measure PBDEs and PBDE metabolites in serum collected from an understudied population of pregnant women late in their third trimester .	1 122 12
21715241-3	A secondary objective was to determine whether the PBDEs or their metabolites were associated with maternal thyroid hormones .	1 11 1112 111
21715241-4	METHODS One hundred forty pregnant women &gt ; 34 weeks into their pregnancy were recruited into this study between 2008 and 2010 .	
21715241-5	Blood samples were collected during a routine prenatal clinic visit .	1 122 12
21715241-6	Serum was analyzed for a suite of PBDEs , three phenolic metabolites ( i.e. , containing an -OH moiety ) , and five thyroid hormones .	11 12 1 122 1112 111
21715241-7	RESULTS PBDEs were detected in all samples and ranged from 3.6 to 694 ng/g lipid .	
21715241-8	Two hydroxylated BDE congeners ( 4Â´-OH-BDE 49 and 6-OH-BDE 47 ) were detected in &gt ; 67% of the samples .	
21715241-9	BDEs 47 , 99 , and 100 were significantly and positively associated with free and total thyroxine ( T4 ) levels and with total triiodothyronine levels above the normal range .	11 1 11122 1112 111
21715241-10	Associations between T4 and PBDEs remained after controlling for smoking status , maternal age , race , gestational age , and parity .	
21715241-11	CONCLUSIONS PBDEs and OH-BDEs are prevalent in this cohort , and levels are similar to those in the general population .	
21715241-12	Given their long half-lives , PBDEs may be affecting thyroid regulation throughout pregnancy .	
21715241-13	Further research is warranted to determine mechanisms through which PBDEs affect thyroid hormone levels in developing fetuses and newborn babies .	
17595171-0	OBJECTIVES The Italian information system for recording occupational exposures to carcinogens ( SIREP ) was set up in 1996 as a result of the implementation of European directives concerning the improvement of workplace safety and health .	
17595171-1	The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of this information system designed and developed for monitoring exposure risk at workplace .	
17595171-2	The main results about exposed workers in Italy are also presented .	
17595171-3	Moreover , we discuss the choices adopted when setting up the structure and the issues encountered in recording data and introduce future developments of the system .	
17595171-4	METHODS The design of the information system made use of the structured analysis technique , and it is based on a relational database .	
17595171-5	Particular attention has been addressed to the system security to prevent non-authorized accesses and to guarantee data integrity .	
17595171-6	The core information of the database is in accordance with recommendations of the European work group on the measurements of the exposures in the workplace .	
17595171-7	Results are reported by economic sector , carcinogenic agent , job task and exposure level .	
17595171-8	RESULTS The professional exposures of approximately 36,547 employees from 2778 firms were reported to the SIREP database in the period 1996-2005 .	2
17595171-9	The three prevalent exposures-hardwood dust , benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-account for &gt;25% of the exposed workers .	24 2 242
17595171-10	The main economic activity involved is wood industry and furniture manufacture , while the most frequently observed job is chemical-processing plant operator of petrochemical plants .	
17595171-11	At the end of 2005 , &gt;100,000 different exposure histories were recorded and the number of exposed workers accounts for approximately 0.2% of the Italian workforce .	2 21
17595171-12	CONCLUSIONS The SIREP database has been set up in order to assess , control and reduce the carcinogen risk in the workplace .	
17595171-13	It may be useful as part of a surveillance and monitoring system to determine the need for intervention strategies and to assess their effectiveness .	
21715010-0	Dietary exposure to persistent organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) was assessed for Chinese populations , using the total diet study ( TDS ) approach in 2007 .	24 2 243
21715010-1	Multistage random cluster sampling method was used in this study. 108 composite samples , representative of foods " as consumed " by the Chinese were analyzed for residues of OCPs by a multi-residue method .	
21715010-2	The result showed that hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane ( DDT ) , chlordane compounds ( CHLs ) , hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) and heptachlor could be detected in , respectively 84% , 39% , 37% , 13% and 5% of all samples .	
21715010-3	Concentrations of DDT in all samples ranged from undetectable levels to 72.2 Î¼g/kg .	
21715010-4	Others were minor components in the OCPs profile .	
21715010-5	The residual levels of OCPs were significantly below the Extraneous Maximum Residue Limits ( EMRLs ) .	
21715010-6	Based on the 2000 nationwide food consumption survey , the average dietary exposure of the Chinese to DDT , HCH , HCB , CHLs , and heptachlor was estimated to be 0.016 , 0.002 , 0.009 , 0.006 , and 0.001 Î¼g/kg body weight per day respectively , showing a significant decrease trend compared with the past .	24 2 243
21715010-7	The major food groups contributing to dietary OCPs were aquatic foods , meats , and cereals .	24 2 243
21715010-8	The average and high end estimated daily intakes of different OCPs for the Chinese were both lower than the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) suggested by authorities indicating low health risk of OCPs dietary exposure among Chinese adults at present .	24 2
21715010-9	However , the risk of carcinogenicity of the OCPs should be concerned with if the carcinogenicity effects from the exposures to these OCPs were considered .	
17600756-0	Cytogenetic biomarkers are essential for assessing environmental exposure that can predict adverse human health effects such as cellular damage .	
17600756-1	Chromosomal aberrations are the most important cytogenetic end-points successfully used for the cancer risk assessment of populations occupationally or environmentally exposed to different toxic chemicals .	1111 1 111 11
17600756-2	Previous reports suggest that , increased frequency of chromosomal aberration ( CA ) , in peripheral blood lymphocytes , is a predictor of cancer .	
17600756-3	Arsenic is a paradoxical human carcinogen , clastogen and aneugen .	
17600756-4	Despite of exposure at similar extent , only 15-20% of individuals show arsenic induced skin lesions including Bowen's disease ( BD ) .	
17600756-5	Previously we have reported the significant increase in CA in the individuals with arsenic induced skin lesions when compared to individuals without any skin lesions , drinking arsenic contaminated water at similar extent .	1 11 112
17600756-6	Presently , a matched case-control study was performed to examine whether biomarkers such as chromosomal aberrations can predict the development of arsenic induced Bowen's ( in situ carcinoma ) diseases .	1111 1 111 11
17600756-7	Chromosomal aberrations ( both chromosome and chromatid types ) and mitotic index were analyzed from the lymphocytes of 25 cases of Bowen's patient which was compared to matched control from the individuals with arsenic induced non-cancerous skin lesions such as raindrop pigmentation , keratosis of palm and sole , hypo and hyper pigmentation .	1 1111 11 111 112
17600756-8	Chromosomal aberrations/cell , chromosome type aberrations and total percentage of aberrant cells were significantly higher in cases compared to control ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	1111 1 111 11
17600756-9	These results suggest that chromosomal aberrations can be used for cancer risk assessment of the population exposed to arsenic through drinking water .	
21713497-0	The study , which measured the concentrations of Hg , Pb , Cd , Zn and As in various fish tissues ( muscle , gill and liver ) of 10 fish species ( Abramis brama danubii , Alburnus alburnus alburnus , Barbus meridionalis petenyi , Carassius auratius gibelio , Cyprinus carpio , Lepomis gibossus , Leuciscius cephalus cephalus , Perca fluviatilis fluviatilis , Rutilus rutilus , Scardinus erythrophtlalmus erythrophtlalmus ) collected in the Å alek lakes , is the first survey regarding metal concentrations in fish species with samples originating from Slovene lakes , while only a limited number of such studies have been carried out in southeastern Europe .	
21713497-1	Since these lakes are situated in the close vicinity of the largest Slovene thermal power plant , the study provides an insight into the potential impact of increased levels of metals in the environment as well as an estimate of the contamination of fish tissues with metals .	
21713497-2	Furthermore , it was possible to compare the results obtained with those from other studies regarding metal levels in freshwater fish species .	
21713497-3	The mean metal concentrations of different tissues irrespective of species varied in the following ranges : Zn 4.31-199mg/kg ww , Pb 0.01-0.48mg/kg ww , As 0.02-0.44mg/kg ww , Hg &lt;0.01-0.31mg/kg ww , Cd &lt ; 0.01-0.19mg/kg ww .	
21713497-4	In general , higher contents of Hg were found in muscles and livers than in gills and higher contents of As in gills and livers than in muscles , respectively .	
21713497-5	The accumulation of Pb and Zn was most pronounced in gills .	
21713497-6	The result obtained regarding metal concentrations in fish revealed that the ecosystems of the Å alek lakes are not polluted with Hg and Pb , slightly loaded with As and Cd and moderately polluted with Zn .	
21713497-7	In addition , the potential human health risk due to fish consumption was assessed .	24 2 243
21713497-8	This showed that the estimated weekly intakes for all metals were far below provisional permissible tolerable weekly intakes determined by WHO/FAO .	24 2 243
21713497-9	The consumption of fish from the Å alek lakes , therefore , does not pose a risk to human health .	
16781705-0	Peritoneal endometriosis ( PE ) and deep endometriotic nodules ( DEN ) are gynecological diseases recently shown to be associated with elevated serum concentrations of organochlorines .	
16781705-1	The objective of the present study was to compare risk factors associated with both forms of the disease , with a particular attention to potential sources of organochlorine exposure .	
16781705-2	This matched case-control study with prospective recruitment included 88 triads ( PE-DEN-control ) .	
16781705-3	All women were face-to-face interviewed with a standardized questionnaire , and serum dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyl measurements were available for 58 of them .	1 122 12
16781705-4	Alcohol consumption ( odds ratio ( OR ) : 5.82 [ confidence interval at 95% ( 95%CI ) 1.20-28.3] ) in DEN and low physical activity at work for DEN ( OR : 4.58 [ 95%CI 1.80-11.62] ) and PE ( OR : 5.61 [ 95%CI 1.90-16.60] ) were traced as significant risk factors .	
16781705-5	Organochlorine-related factors ( use of tampons , occupational or environmental exposure ) were not related to the disease .	
16781705-6	The current consumption of foodstuffs that were more likely to contribute to organochlorine body burden did not differ among the groups .	24 2 243
16781705-7	Only some of these fatty foodstuffs ( marine fish , pig meat ) were traced by multiple regression analysis as significant determinants of organochlorine body burden , explaining only a small fraction ( 20% ) of the interindividual variation of organochlorine body burden .	24 2 243
16781705-8	We conclude that PE and DEN share similar patterns of risk or protective factors .	
16793116-0	Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) have recently received attention due to their widespread contamination in the environment , as well as in wildlife and humans .	
16793116-1	We measured the PFOS and PFOA concentrations in historically recorded human serum samples at an age range between 20 and 59 years collected in Kyoto , 20 persons per each time point ( n=100 ) , and also the PFOS and PFOA concentrations in human serum samples at an age range between 20 and 59 years from 10 locations throughout Japan ( n=200 ) .	1 122 12
16793116-2	The historical samples collected from 1983 to 1999 demonstrated that the PFOA concentrations in males and females from Kyoto have increased 4.4-fold and 4.3-fold at a rate of increase of 0.49 ng/ml/year and 0.42 ng/ml/year , respectively .	
16793116-3	In contrast , serum concentrations of PFOS reached a plateau in the late 1980s .	1 122 12
16793116-4	There are also regional differences in both the PFOS and PFOA serum concentrations .	
16793116-5	The concentrations in serum [ geometric mean ( geometric standard deviation) ] ( ng/ml ) in 2003-2004 ranged from 7.6(1.6) in the town of Matsuoka in Fukui prefecture to 27.8(1.6) in Kyoto city , and ranged from 2.3(1.5) in Matsuoka to 14.5(1.3) in Osaka city for PFOS and PFOA , respectively .	1 122 12
16823400-0	We analyzed the weighted 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to assess potential differences in mean total 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) TEQ between various groups of individuals and to determine serum reference concentrations for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins , dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in the general US population .	
16823400-1	Differences appeared to exist between female smokers and non-smokers and between non-Hispanic groups and all other races .	
16823400-2	Potential differences were also observed among the four age groups with an increasing trend in mean total TCDD TEQ with increasing age .	
16823400-3	Both age and gender appeared to confound the association between smoking status and total TCDD TEQ , dictating the need for further analysis .	
16823400-4	As anticipated , PCBs contributed appreciably to the total TCDD TEQ levels in the referent population and accounted for 38% to 41% of the total TEQ depending on age .	
16823400-5	Nearly 80% of the mean total TCDD TEQ was attributable to four PCDD/F congeners and three PCB congeners .	
16823400-6	In this analysis , two methods were used to assess samples where the concentrations were below the limits of detection ( LODs ) , and this did not have significant impact on the mean total TCDD TEQ at the higher percentiles and for older individuals .	
16823400-7	Comparison of our results to those from a recent PCDD/F biomonitoring study indicates that the mean TCDD TEQ serum concentration of the individuals studied does not appear to be different from typical levels found in the general US population .	1 122 12
16823400-8	Additionally , an assessment of data from the National Human Adipose Tissue Survey using our referent statistics shows that levels of these chemicals have been declining in the general population for at least two decades .	
16823400-9	The reference TEQs presented in this paper provide relevant , current data that can be used to evaluate biomonitoring results of individuals or groups exposed or potentially exposed to PCDD/Fs and PCBs above referent levels .	
21703688-0	The impact of cigarette smoking on volatile organic compound ( VOC ) blood levels is studied using 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) data .	1 122 12
21703688-1	Cigarette smoke exposure is shown to be a predominant source of benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , xylenes and styrene ( BTEXS ) measured in blood as determined by ( 1 ) differences in central tendency and interquartile VOC blood levels between daily smokers [ â¥1 cigarette per day ( CPD) ] and less-than-daily smokers , ( 2 ) correlation among BTEXS and the 2,5-dimethylfuran ( 2,5-DMF ) smoking biomarker in the blood of daily smokers , and ( 3 ) regression modeling of BTEXS blood levels versus categorized CPD .	1 122 12
21703688-2	Smoking status was determined by 2,5-DMF blood level using a cutpoint of 0.014 ng/ml estimated by regression modeling of the weighted data and confirmed with receiver operator curve ( ROC ) analysis .	
21703688-3	The BTEXS blood levels among daily smokers were moderately-to-strongly correlated with 2,5-DMF blood levels ( correlation coefficient , r , ranging from 0.46 to 0.92 ) .	1 122 12
21703688-4	Linear regression of the geometric mean BTEXS blood levels versus categorized CPD showed clear dose-response relationship ( correlation of determination , R(2) , ranging from 0.81 to 0.98 ) .	
21703688-5	Furthermore , the pattern of VOCs in blood of smokers is similar to that reported in mainstream cigarette smoke .	
21703688-6	These results show that cigarette smoking is a primary source of benzene , toluene and styrene and an important source of ethylbenzene and xylene exposure for the U.S. population , as well as the necessity of determining smoking status and factors affecting dose ( e.g. , CPD , time since last cigarette ) in assessments involving BTEXS exposure .	2 232 23
21700277-0	The contamination of traditional foods with chemical pollutants is a challenge to the food security of Aboriginal Peoples .	
21700277-1	Mercury levels are generally low in terrestrial animals ; however renal mercury levels have been shown to change over time in the Porcupine Caribou Herd , the principal food source for the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation of Old Crow in Yukon , Canada .	
21700277-2	Seventy-five Porcupine Caribou muscle , sixty-three kidney and three liver samples were analyzed for total mercury .	
21700277-3	Average concentrations were 0.003 , 0.360 and 0.120mg/kg wet weight total mercury for muscle , kidney and liver , respectively .	
21700277-4	Consumption data of caribou muscle , kidney and liver were collected from twenty-six adults in Vuntut Gwitchin households .	
21700277-5	Women of child-bearing age ( n=5 ) consumed a median of 71.5g/person/day of caribou muscle and 0.0g/person/day kidney but consumed no liver ; median consumptions for all other adults ( women aged 40+ and all men , n=21 ) were 75.8 , 3.2 and 2.5g/person/day for meat , kidney and liver , respectively .	
21700277-6	Median dietary exposures to total mercury from caribou tissues were estimated to be 0.138Î¼g/kg body weight for women of child-bearing age and 0.223Î¼g/kg body weight for other adults .	24 2 243
21700277-7	Caribou tissues were found to contribute high levels of important nutrients to the diet and pose minimal health risk from mercury exposure .	
17712957-0	OBJECTIVE To explore risk factors of the patients with skin lesions from burning high-arsenic-contaminated coal in southern Shanxi Province .	
17712957-1	METHODS An epidemiological cross-sectional study was conducted in two villages of Hanbin District , Ankang City , Shanxi Province , where 198 participants were randomly selected .	
17712957-2	The parts of factors which were not significantly different were rejected via the single variable analysis and the collinear relationships were removed between the other factors using principal components analysis , and then the major risk factors of the skin lesions from burning high-arsenic-contaminated coal were obtained from stepwise logistic regression .	1 11 112
17712957-3	RESULTS The single variable analysis showed that 11 influential variables were significantly associaed with coal-burning-arsenic-associated skin lesions , while principal component and logistic regression analysis showed that 6 variables could be the principal , which were period of burning arsenic-contaminating coal , ege , the arsenic content in blood , resident duration , the arsenic content in urine and hair , respectively .	1 122 12 127 123
17712957-4	CONCLUSION The results suggested that the major risk factors of the skin lesions related to burning coal-contaminating arsenic should be period of burning arsenic-contaminating coal , age , the arsenic content in blood , resident duration , the arsenic content in urine and hair .	
16832218-0	OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determined if there was a relationship between Grover's disease and Parkinson disease .	
16832218-1	METHODS Fourteen patients with Parkinson disease and 14 control patients were randomly selected and examined for cutaneous eruptions and blood mercury levels .	11 1 122 12 112
16832218-2	RESULTS Of the 14 patients with Parkinson's disease , 13 had Grover's disease and detectable blood mercury .	
16832218-3	None of the patients in the control group had a cutaneous eruption and only 2of the 14 had detectable blood mercury .	
16832218-4	CONCLUSION Mercury may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson disease and Grover's disease .	
17712962-0	OBJECTIVE To explore the spatial features of arsenic contamination and its association with chronic arsenic poisoning in a tin mining area of Thailand .	
17712962-1	METHODS Geographic information system(GIS) was built up with integration of arsenic concentration in varied environmental media and occurring location data of chronic arsenism patients .	
17712962-2	Then , the spatial interpolation ( IDW ) , buffer zoning , query and rank correlation analysis were applied .	
17712962-3	RESULTS Groundwater and surface farming land were classified according to local environmental arsenic standards ; the relative risk areas were identified .	
17712962-4	The incidence of chronic arsenic poisoning was significantly correlated with arsenic level in groundwater and soil type ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , and insignificantly related with water soluble arsenic in soil ( P &gt ; 0.05 ) .	245 24 2 241
17712962-5	CONCLUSION The arsenic content in drinking water could be critical to chronic arsenic poisoning .	24 2 241
17712962-6	The soil type could be an important factor affecting such poisoning .	245 24 2
17712962-7	Trend analysis in GIS could provide a valuable tool for understanding the pollution situation and disease surveillance .	
16779578-0	Anupgarh is the most fertile area of Rajasthan state where a variety of seasonal crops are grown .	
16779578-1	The availability of three manmade canals has enhanced the agricultural activities in this area .	
16779578-2	The farmers use huge amounts of pesticides to increase the crop productivity .	
16779578-3	Exposure of humans to these hazardous chemicals occurs directly in the fields and indirectly due to consumption of contaminated diet , or by inhalation or by dermal contact .	
16779578-4	The organochlorine pesticides are reported to be lipophilic and their presence in human milk and blood has been documented in different parts of the world .	
16779578-5	Blood and milk samples were collected from lactating women who were divided into four groups on the basis of different living standards viz residence area , dietary habits , working conditions and addiction to tobacco .	24 12 1 122 2 124 243
16779578-6	The level of total organochlorine pesticides in blood ranged from 3.319mg/L-6.253mg/L while in milk samples it ranged from 3.209Mdash;4.608 mg/L .	1 122 12 124
16779578-7	The results are in concurrence with the reports from other countries .	
16835061-0	OBJECTIVES Our goal in this study was to explore the use of a hybrid approach to calculate benchmark doses ( BMDs ) and their 95% lower confidence bounds ( BMDLs ) for renal effects of cadmium in a population with low environmental exposure .	
16835061-1	METHODS Morning urine and blood samples were collected from 820 Swedish women 53-64 years of age .	1 12 127
16835061-2	We measured urinary cadmium ( U-Cd ) and tubular effect markers [ N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) and human complex-forming protein ( protein HC ) ] in 790 women and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ; based on serum cystatin C ) in 700 women .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
16835061-3	Age , body mass index , use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , and blood lead levels were used as covariates for estimated GFR .	
16835061-4	BMDs/BMDLs corresponding to an additional risk ( benchmark response ) of 5 or 10% were calculated ( the background risk at zero exposure was set to 5% ) .	
16835061-5	The results were compared with the estimated critical concentrations obtained by applying logistic models used in previous studies on the present data .	
16835061-6	RESULTS For both NAG and protein HC , the BMDs ( BMDLs ) of U-Cd were 0.5-1.1 ( 0.4-0.8 ) microg/L ( adjusted for specific gravity of 1.015 g/mL ) and 0.6-1.1 ( 0.5-0.8 ) microg/g creatinine .	
16835061-7	For estimated GFR , the BMDs ( BMDLs ) were 0.8-1.3 ( 0.5-0.9 ) microg/L adjusted for specific gravity and 1.1-1.8 ( 0.7-1.2 ) microg/g creatinine .	
16835061-8	CONCLUSION The obtained benchmark doses of U-Cd were lower than the critical concentrations previously reported .	
16835061-9	The critical dose level for glomerular effects was only slightly higher than that for tubular effects .	
16835061-10	We suggest that the hybrid approach is more appropriate for estimation of the critical U-Cd concentration , because the choice of cutoff values in logistic models largely influenced the obtained critical U-Cd .	
17877765-0	BACKGROUND Epidemiological studies that have investigated the association between air pollution and atopy have found inconsistent results .	
17877765-1	Furthermore , often exposure to outdoor air pollution has had limited quality , and more individual exposure is needed .	
17877765-2	OBJECTIVE To investigate the relations between early and lifetime exposure to residential outdoor air pollution and allergen sensitization in 9-10-year-old children in Oslo , Norway .	2 231 23
17877765-3	METHODS Sensitization to common allergens was measured by skin prick tests ( SPTs ) , which were performed in 2244 children who had lived in Oslo since birth .	
17877765-4	Several definitions of positive SPT were used .	
17877765-5	Information on potential confounding variables was collected by a parental questionnaire .	
17877765-6	Exposure to outdoor air pollution was assessed by the EPISODE dispersion model , which calculates hourly concentrations of nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , particulate matter ( PM ) with aerodynamic diameter &lt;10 microm ( PM10 ) and &lt;2.5 microm ( PM2.5 ) , respectively .	2 231 23
17877765-7	RESULTS We found no associations between long-term air pollution exposure and sensitization to any allergen , any indoor or any pollen allergen .	2 23
17877765-8	However , lifetime air pollution exposure was associated with sensitization to the house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae .	2 23
17877765-9	One interquartile increase of lifetime exposure to NO2 , PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with 1.88 ( adjusted odds ratio ) ( 1.02 , 3.47 ) [ 95% confidence interval ( CI) ] , 1.61 ( 0.96 , 2.72 ) and 1.46 ( 0.96 , 2.22 ) , respectively , for D. farinae .	
17877765-10	Lifetime exposure was also associated with sensitization to cat in a subpopulation .	
17877765-11	Both associations diminished after adjusting for a contextual socio-economic factor .	
17877765-12	CONCLUSION Long-term exposure to traffic-related pollutants was generally not associated with allergen sensitization in 9-10-year-old Oslo children .	2 23
17877765-13	However , lifetime exposure was associated with sensitization to D. farinae , and with sensitization to cat in a subpopulation , which may be explained by socio-economic confounding or multiple comparisons .	
17877765-14	The air pollution levels in Oslo may be too low to reveal associations with sensitization .	
17886057-0	Exposure to fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) from traffic affects heart-rate variability , thrombosis , and inflammation .	
17886057-1	This reanalysis investigated components potentially contributing to such effects in nonsmoking healthy male North Carolina highway patrol troopers .	
17886057-2	Nine officers were studied four times during their late shift .	
17886057-3	PM2.5 , its elemental composition , and gaseous copollutants were measured inside patrol cars .	2 232 23
17886057-4	Components correlated to PM2.5 were compared to cardiac and blood parameters measured 10 and 15 h , respectively , after each shift .	11 1
17886057-5	Mixed effects models with control for PM2.5 were used .	
17886057-6	Components that were associated with health endpoints independently from PM2.5 were calcium ( increased uric acid and von Willebrand Factor [ vWF ] , decreased protein C ) , chromium ( increased white blood cell count and interleukin 6 ) , aldehydes ( increased vWF , mean cycle length of normal R-R intervals [ MCL ] , and heart-rate variability parameter pNN50 ) , copper ( increased blood urea nitrogen and MCL ; decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ) , and sulfur ( increased ventricular ectopic beats ) .	11 11122 1 1113 11123 111 112 1112
17886057-7	Control for gaseous copollutants had little effect on the effect estimates .	
17886057-8	The changes observed are consistent with effects reported earlier for PM2.5 from speed-change traffic ( characterized by copper , sulfur , and aldehydes ) and from soil ( with calcium ) .	
17886057-9	The associations of chromium with inflammation markers were not seen before for traffic particles , but they are consistent with the toxicological literature although at low concentrations .	11 1
17886057-10	Copper , sulfur , aldehydes , calcium , and chromium or compounds containing these elements seem to directly contribute to the inflammatory , coagulatory , and cardiac response to PM2.5 from traffic in the investigated patrol troopers .	
12455267-0	We investigated the levels of the major house dust mite allergens , Der p 1 and Der f 1 , in dust collected from various locations in 41 day-care centers from two German cities ( DÃ¼sseldorf and Bonn ) .	24 2 242
12455267-1	One hundred and thirty-seven ( 96% ) of 143 samples yielded detectable amounts of house dust mite allergen ( range , &lt ; 15-85,000 ng/g ; interquartile range , 210-1,480 ng group I allergen [ sum of Der p 1 and Der f 1]/g dust ) , and 24 ( 17% ) of the samples ( 8/34 mattresses ; 11/46 cushions/soft toys ; 5/43 carpeted floors , 0/20 smooth floors ) exceeded the proposed " threshold " level of 2,000 ng/g dust in 18 ( 44% ) of 41 day-care centers .	24 2 242
12455267-2	Der p 1 and Der f 1 could be detected in nearly an equal number of samples .	
12455267-3	The highest concentrations of house dust mite allergens were found in dust from mattresses ( geometric mean , 1,103 ng/g dust ) and cushions/soft toys ( geometric mean , 1,004 ng/g dust ) .	24 2 242
12455267-4	The allergen load per unit area from carpeted floors exceeded that from smooth floors by more than two orders of magnitude .	
12455267-5	In comparison with dust samples from private homes within the same geographical area , the mite allergen levels in mattress dust ( RR , 0.34 ; CI95 , 0.18-0.64 ) and floor dust ( RR , 0.21 ; CI95 , 0.09-0.49 ) from day-care centers were significantly lower ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
12455267-6	We conclude that day-care centers should be included as potential places of additional exposure to house dust mite allergens if avoidance measures are taken .	
16835064-0	We assessed determinants of cord serum polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) levels among 720 infants born between 1993 and 1998 to mothers living near a PCB-contaminated Superfund site in Massachusetts , measuring the sum of 51 PCB congeners ( capital sigmaPCB ) and ascertaining maternal address , diet , sociodemographics , and exposure risk factors .	1 122 12
16835064-1	Addresses were geocoded to obtain distance to the Superfund site and neighborhood characteristics .	
16835064-2	We modeled log10(capital sigmaPCB ) as a function of potential individual and neighborhood risk factors , mapping model residuals to assess spatial correlates of PCB exposure .	
16835064-3	Similar analyses were performed for light ( mono-tetra ) and heavy ( penta-deca ) PCBs to assess potential differences in exposure pathways as a function of relative volatility .	
16835064-4	PCB-118 ( relatively prevalent in site sediments and cord serum ) was assessed separately .	1 122 12
16835064-5	The geometric mean of capital sigmaPCB levels was 0.40 ( range , 0.068-18.14 ) ng/g serum .	
16835064-6	Maternal age and birthplace were the strongest predictors of capital sigmaPCB levels .	
16835064-7	Maternal consumption of organ meat and local dairy products was associated with higher and smoking and previous lactation with lower capital sigmaPCB levels .	24 2 243
16835064-8	Infants born later in the study had lower capital sigmaPCB levels , likely due to temporal declines in exposure and site remediation in 1994-1995 .	
16835064-9	No association was found between capital sigmaPCB levels and residential distance from the Superfund site .	
16835064-10	Similar results were found with light and heavy PCBs and PCB-118 .	
16835064-11	Previously reported demographic ( age ) and other ( lactation , smoking , diet ) correlates of PCB exposure , as well as local factors ( consumption of local dairy products and Superfund site dredging ) but not residential proximity to the site , were important determinants of cord serum PCB levels in the study community .	
21682250-0	BACKGROUND Perfluorinated chemicals ( PFCs ) have been used widely in consumer products since the 1950s and are currently found at detectable levels in the blood of humans and animals across the globe .	
21682250-1	In stark contrast to this widespread exposure to PFCs , there is relatively little research on potential adverse health effects of exposure to these chemicals .	
21682250-2	OBJECTIVES We performed this cross-sectional study to determine if specific blood PFC levels are associated with impaired response inhibition in children .	1 122 12
21682250-3	METHODS Blood levels of 11 PFCs were measured in children ( N = 83 ) and 6 PFCs : perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorohexane sulfate ( PFHxS ) , perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) , perfluorooctanesulfonamide ( PFOSA ) , and perfluorodecanoic acid ( PFDA ) - were found at detectable levels in most children ( 87.5% or greater had detectable levels ) .	1 122 12
21682250-4	These levels were analyzed in relation to the differential reinforcement of low rates of responding ( DRL ) task .	1 11 112
21682250-5	This task rewards delays between responses ( i.e. , longer inter-response times ; IRTs ) and therefore constitutes a measure of response inhibition .	1 11 112
21682250-6	RESULTS Higher levels of blood PFOS , PFNA , PFDA , PFHxS , and PFOSA were associated with significantly shorter IRTs during the DRL task .	1 122 12
21682250-7	The magnitude of these associations was such that IRTs during the task decreased by 29-34% for every 1 SD increase in the corresponding blood PFC .	
21682250-8	CONCLUSIONS This study suggests an association between PFC exposure and children's impulsivity .	
21682250-9	Although intriguing , there is a need for further investigation and replication with a larger sample of children .	
12415886-0	Poor indoor air quality ( IAQ ) in daycare facilities affects both attending children and care providers .	2 232 23
12415886-1	Incident rates of upper-respiratory-tract infections have been reported to be higher in children who attend daycare .	
12415886-2	Excessive carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) exposure can cause several health effects and even sudden infant death .	
12415886-3	For this study , 26 facilities were randomly selected in a Midwestern county of the United States .	
12415886-4	CO2 , room temperature , and relative humidity were used as indicators for IAQ and comfort levels .	
12415886-5	These IAQ parameters were continuously monitored for eight hours at each facility by a direct-reading instrument that was calibrated before each measurement .	
12415886-6	More than 50 percent of the facilities had an average CO2 level over the American Society of Heating , Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) standard of 1,000 parts per million ( ppm ) .	2 232 23
12415886-7	For temperature and relative humidity , respectively , 42.3 percent and 15.4 percent of facilities were outside of the ASHRAE-recommended comfort zones .	
12415886-8	The nap-time average CO2 level was about 117 ppm higher than the non-nap-time level .	
12415886-9	The increment of the nap-time CO2 level in the sleeping-only room over the level in multipurpose rooms was statistically significant ( p &lt ; .05 ) .	
12415886-10	According to stepwise multiple regression analysis , nap-time CO2 level was predicted by CO2 level before occupancy , nap-time average temperature , carbon monoxide , and child density ( R2 = .83 ) .	
12415886-11	It is recommended that an appropriate IAQ standard for daycare facilities be established and that children should not be placed in a completely isolated room during nap time .	
21681997-0	BACKGROUND Levels of fine particulate matter [ â¤ 2.5 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM(2.5)) ] are associated with alterations in arterial hemodynamics and vascular function .	
21681997-1	However , the characteristics of the same-day exposure-response relationships remain unclear .	
21681997-2	OBJECTIVES We aimed to explore the effects of personal PM(2.5) exposures within the preceding 24 hr on blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , brachial artery diameter ( BAD ) , endothelial function [ flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD) ] , and nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation ( NMD ) .	11 23 1 2 112 233
21681997-3	METHODS Fifty-one nonsmoking subjects had up to 5 consecutive days of 24-hr personal PM(2.5) monitoring and daily cardiovascular ( CV ) measurements during summer and/or winter periods .	2 233 23
21681997-4	The associations between integrated hour-long total personal PM(2.5) exposure ( TPE ) levels ( continuous nephelometry among compliant subjects with low secondhand tobacco smoke exposures ; n = 30 ) with the CV outcomes were assessed over a 24-hr period by linear mixed models .	2 233 23
21681997-5	RESULTS We observed the strongest associations ( and smallest estimation errors ) between HR and TPE recorded 1-10 hr before CV measurements .	
21681997-6	The associations were not pronounced for the other time lags ( 11-24 hr ) .	
21681997-7	The associations between TPE and FMD or BAD did not show as clear a temporal pattern .	
21681997-8	However , we found some suggestion of a negative association with FMD and a positive association with BAD related to TPE just before measurement ( 0-2 hr ) .	
21681997-9	CONCLUSIONS Brief elevations in ambient TPE levels encountered during routine daily activity were associated with small increases in HR and trends toward conduit arterial vasodilatation and endothelial dysfunction within a few hours of exposure .	
21681997-10	These responses could reflect acute PM(2.5)-induced autonomic imbalance and may factor in the associated rapid increase in CV risk among susceptible individuals .	
21676388-0	BACKGROUND Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is a chemical suspected of causing endocrine and metabolic disruption in animals and humans .	
21676388-1	In rodents , in utero exposure to low-dose BPA is associated with weight gain .	
21676388-2	Detectable levels of BPA are found in most Americans due to its widespread use in the manufacture of food and drink packaging .	
21676388-3	We hypothesized that urinary BPA concentrations would be positively associated with general and central obesity .	11 1 127 12 112
21676388-4	METHODS Cross-sectional analysis of urinary BPA concentrations , body mass index , and waist circumference in 2747 adults ( aged 18-74 ) , using pooled data from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys .	11 1 127 12 112
21676388-5	RESULTS The creatinine-adjusted geometric mean urinary BPA concentration was 2.05Î¼g/g creatinine ( 25th percentile : 1.18 , 75% percentile : 3.33 ) .	1 12 127
21676388-6	Relative to those in the lowest BPA quartile , participants in the upper BPA quartiles were more likely to be classified as obese ( quartile 2 odds ratio ( OR ) : 1.85 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.22 , 2.79 ; quartile 3 OR : 1.60 , 95% CI : 1.05-2.44 ; quartile 4 OR : 1.76 , 95% CI : 1.06-2.94 ) .	
21676388-7	Higher BPA concentration was also associated with abdominal obesity ( quartile 2 OR : 1.62 , 95% CI : 1.11 , 2.36 ; quartile 3 OR : 1.39 , 95% CI : 1.02-1.90 ; quartile 4 OR : 1.58 , 95% CI : 1.03-2.42 ) .	1 11 112
21676388-8	CONCLUSIONS Higher BPA exposure is associated with general and central obesity in the general adult population of the United States .	
21676388-9	Reverse causation is of concern due to the cross-sectional nature of this study ; longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the direction of the association .	
17952776-0	High levels of urinary arsenic have been reported among residents of an area of southern Thailand where many households have shallow wells heavily contaminated with arsenic .	
17952776-1	However , the finding that very few of the residents in this area have used contaminated shallow-well water for drinking or cooking in the last 10 years prompted this investigation .	
17952776-2	The aim was to identify the uses of shallow-well water by adult residents that were related to a positive association between shallow-well water and urinary arsenic levels .	24 12 1 2 241 127
17952776-3	Information on shallow-well water use for all personal and domestic purposes was obtained and arsenic levels of household shallow-well water and urine ( after refraining from seafood for 2 days ) were measured .	24 12 1 2 241 127
17952776-4	Urinary and shallow-well water arsenic levels were strongly positively associated among residents who regularly used shallow-well water for bathing ( including washing face , hair , hands and feet ) but not among residents regularly using arsenic-safe water for bathing or regularly using shallow-well water for other purposes , such as brushing teeth , domestic cleaning or washing food and utensils .	24 12 1 2 241 127
17952776-5	The findings suggest that appreciable transdermal absorption of arsenic is possible and that successful abatement of human contamination with arsenic may require the provision of arsenic-safe water , not only for consumption but also for personal hygiene purposes .	
21672679-0	BACKGROUND Few studies have examined the acute health effects of air pollution exposures experienced while cycling in traffic .	
21672679-1	OBJECTIVES We conducted a crossover study to examine the relationship between traffic pollution and acute changes in heart rate variability .	11 1 2 112 23
21672679-2	We also collected spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide measures .	11 1 12 125 112
21672679-3	METHODS Forty-two healthy adults cycled for 1 hr on high- and low-traffic routes as well as indoors .	
21672679-4	Health measures were collected before cycling and 1-4 hr after the start of cycling .	
21672679-5	Ultrafine particles ( UFPs ; â¤ 0.1 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter ) , particulate matter â¤ 2.5 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5 ) , black carbon , and volatile organic compounds were measured along each cycling route , and ambient nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) and ozone ( O3 ) levels were recorded from a fixed-site monitor .	2 232 23
21672679-6	Mixed-effects models were used to estimate associations between air pollutants and changes in health outcome measures relative to precycling baseline values .	2 23
21672679-7	RESULTS An interquartile range increase in UFP levels ( 18,200/cm3 ) was associated with a significant decrease in high-frequency power 4 hr after the start of cycling [ Î² = -224 msec2 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , -386 to -63 msec2 ] .	
21672679-8	Ambient NO2 levels were inversely associated with the standard deviation of normal-to-normal ( NN ) intervals ( Î² = -10 msec ; 95% CI , -20 to -0.34 msec ) and positively associated with the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power ( Î² = 1.4 ; 95% CI , 0.35 to 2.5 ) 2 hr after the start of cycling .	
21672679-9	We also observed significant inverse associations between ambient O3 levels and the root mean square of successive differences in adjacent NN intervals 3 hr after the start of cycling .	
21672679-10	CONCLUSIONS Short-term exposures to traffic pollution may contribute to altered autonomic modulation of the heart in the hours immediately after cycling .	
17952786-0	Since 1990 , a large number of people have been experiencing various health problems from drinking arsenic contaminated water ( 50-1860 microg/L ) in 13 counties of Inner Mongolia , China , most of which are located in the Hetao Plain area .	24 2 241
17952786-1	It is calculated that 411,243 people are currently at risk from arsenic poisoning .	
17952786-2	Clinical and epidemiological investigations were carried out on 13,021 people to ascertain the nature and degree of morbidity that occurred due to chronic arsenic toxicity .	
17952786-3	In all of the studied patients , 22% had typical hyperkeratosis on the palms or soles and some had raindrop-like hyperpigmentation and depigmentation on the trunk .	1 11 112
17952786-4	Other data recorded included subjective and objective symptoms , such as chronic cough ( 35.0% ) and insomnia ( 37.5% ) .	
17952786-5	During physical checkups of 680 villagers in arsenic affected areas , liver function tests showed elevated globulin levels in 6.8% ( P value=0.006 ) of the subjects .	11 1 11123 111 1112
17952786-6	Neurotoxicity manifesting as loss of hearing 5.88 ( P value=0.005 ) , loss of taste 5.44% ( P value=0.001 ) , blurred vision 17.35% ( P value=0.000 ) , tingling and numbness of the limbs 33.53% ( P value=0.000 ) and hypertension 8.09% ( P value=0.000 ) were significantly higher in the arsenic affected villages and arsenic pollution also seemed to affect patients ' social life and mental health .	1 11 112
17952786-7	To solve the problem of arsenic exposure , the quality of drinking water needs to be improved by reducing the arsenic content .	
17952786-8	We also plan to carry out a survey to detect the incidence and types of cancer among this population .	
17952787-0	Many aquifers in various parts of the world have been found to be contaminated with arsenic at concentration above 0.05 mg/L .	
17952787-1	However reports of large number of affected people in India and Bangladesh are unprecedented .	
17952787-2	Characteristic skin lesions ( pigmentation , depigmentation and keratosis ) are the hallmark signs of chronic arsenic toxicity .	
17952787-3	Emerging evidences show that ingestion of arsenic through drinking water may also lead to non-malignant respiratory effects .	
17952787-4	Early report of non-malignant pulmonary effect of chronic ingestion of arsenic was available from studies in children in Chile as early as 1970 .	
17952787-5	However on the basis of case studies , respiratory effect of chronic arsenic toxicity in adults following drinking of arsenic contaminated water in West Bengal was first reported in 1997 .	
17952787-6	Epidemiological studies carried out in West Bengal on a population of 7683 showed that the prevalence odds ratio ( POR ) estimates were markedly increased for participants with arsenic induced skin lesions who also had high levels of arsenic in their current drinking water source ( &gt ; or = 0.5 mg/L ) compared with individuals who had normal skin and were exposed to low levels of arsenic ( &lt ; 0.05 mg/L ) .	11 24 1 2 241 112
17952787-7	In participants with skin lesions , age-adjusted POR estimates for chronic cough were 7.8 for females ( 95% CI:3.1-19.5 ) and 5.0 for males ( 95% CI:2.6-9.9 ) .	
17952787-8	In Bangladesh , similar study carried out on a population of 218 showed that the crude prevalence ratio for chronic bronchitis was found to be 10.3 ( 95% CI:2.4-43.1 ) for females and 1.6 ( 95% CI:0.8-3.1 ) for males .	
17952787-9	Reports of lung function tests were available from both hospital and population based studies .	
17952787-10	Results show evidences of restrictive , obstructive and combined obstructive and restrictive lung disease in different people having chronic lung disease associated with chronic arsenic toxicity .	
17952787-11	On the basis of clinical study , chest X-ray and HRCT done in Arsenicosis patients with features of chronic lung disease , the abnormalities observed were varied .	
17952787-12	Evidences of obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) and bronchiectasis were found in some of the cases .	
17952787-13	Results of studies carried out on people showing features of Arsenicosis due to drinking arsenic contaminated water provide evidence that arsenic is a potent respiratory toxicant , even following ingestion .	24 2 241
21665017-0	The use of most polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) has been restricted in China ; however , their use remains a concern because of their adverse effects on human health , especially on fetuses and infants .	
21665017-1	To date , there is no data regarding the exposure levels of pregnant women to PCBs and OCPs in Shanghai .	
21665017-2	In order to evaluate PCB and OCP exposure levels and the contribution of dietary habits to these levels , we determined the concentrations of 8 PCBs and 14 OCPs in the umbilical cord blood serum of healthy pregnant women in Shanghai .	1 122 12
21665017-3	Dietary habits of the pregnant women were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire .	24 2 243
21665017-4	Results showed that p , p'-DDE , HCB and Î²-HCH were the major pollutants present in the serum samples ; PCBs were detected in a few samples at low concentrations .	1 122 12
21665017-5	Age , weight and body mass index before delivery were positively associated with serum levels of p , p'-DDE and Î²-HCH .	1 122 12
21665017-6	Women and their husbands who had higher education levels , higher income levels , tended to have higher levels of p , p'-DDE and Î²-HCH .	
21665017-7	Spearman correlation analysis results suggested that consumption of foods such as milk , eggs , meat , fish , and shrimp may contribute to higher serum levels of p , p'-DDE and Î²-HCH .	24 12 1 122 2 243
21665017-8	Furthermore , multiple linear regression analyses indicated that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of fried/flamed food and shellfish were positively associated with Î²-HCH levels , and that the age and educational levels of the pregnant women and their intake of parity , beef , pork , mutton , and shrimp were positively associated with p , p'-DDE levels .	24 2 243
21665017-9	This is the first study to investigate the exposure levels of pregnant women to PCBs and OCPs in Shanghai , and it should provide useful information for future related research .	
11977417-0	Traditional methods for monitoring occupational creosote exposure have focused on inhalation .	
11977417-1	However , there is evidence that dermal exposure contributes importantly to total systemic dose , as measured by biological monitoring methods .	
11977417-2	This study was conducted to further characterize the relationships between inhalation and dermal exposures to creosote , and to compare traditional ambient exposure monitoring versus biological monitoring in 36 creosote-exposed wood treatment workers .	2 22 23
11977417-3	Full-shift personal air samples were obtained , along with post-shift and next-day urine measurements for 1-hydroxypyrene .	12 23 1 2 127 233
11977417-4	There was little or no correlation between airborne measures and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene ( r2 = 0.05 to 0.35 ) .	1 2 127 12 23
11977417-5	More than 90% of 1-hydroxypyrene could be attributed to dermal exposure .	2 22
11977417-6	These data indicate that traditional monitoring methods may be inappropriate for creosote workers , raising concerns about the adequacy of methods currently mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration .	
16875714-0	Many Bangladeshi suffer from arsenic-related health concerns .	
16875714-1	Most mitigation activities focus on identifying contaminated wells and reducing the amount of arsenic ingested from well water .	
16875714-2	Food as a source of arsenic exposure has been recently documented .	
16875714-3	The objectives of this study were to measure the main types of arsenic in commonly consumed foods in Bangladesh and estimate the average daily intake ( ADI ) of arsenic from food and water .	24 2 241 243
16875714-4	Total , organic and inorganic , arsenic were measured in drinking water and in cooked rice and vegetables from Bangladeshi households .	24 2 241 243
16875714-5	The mean total arsenic level in 46 rice samples was 358 microg/kg ( range : 46 to 1,110 microg/kg dry weight ) and 333 microg/kg ( range : 19 to 2,334 microg/kg dry weight ) in 39 vegetable samples .	
16875714-6	Inorganic arsenic calculated as arsenite and arsenate made up 87% of the total arsenic measured in rice , and 96% of the total arsenic in vegetables .	
16875714-7	Total arsenic in water ranged from 200 to 500 microg/L .	
16875714-8	Using individual , self-reported data on daily consumption of rice and drinking water the total arsenic ADI was 1,176 microg ( range : 419 to 2,053 microg ) , 14% attributable to inorganic arsenic in cooked rice .	24 2 241 243
16875714-9	The ADI is a conservative estimate ; vegetable arsenic was not included due to limitations in self-reported daily consumption amounts .	
16875714-10	Given the arsenic levels measured in food and water and consumption of these items , cooked rice and vegetables are a substantial exposure pathway for inorganic arsenic .	24 2 241 243
16875714-11	Intervention strategies must consider all sources of dietary arsenic intake .	
18026622-0	OBJECTIVE Arsenic concentrations in 25% of tube wells in Bangladesh exceed 50 microg/L , a level known to be hazardous .	
18026622-1	Levels in individual wells vary widely .	
18026622-2	We gathered data on arsenic exposure levels and skin lesion prevalence to address the lack of knowledge about risks where the average arsenic concentrations was lower .	
18026622-3	METHODS The nongovernmental organization Gonoshasthaya Kendra did three related studies of keratotic skin lesions since 2004 : ( 1 ) an ecological prevalence survey among 13 705 women aged &gt ; 18 in a random sample of 53 villages ; ( 2 ) a case-control study of 176 cases and age- and village-matched referents ; and ( 3 ) a prevalence survey of the entire population of 11,670 in two additional villages .	
18026622-4	We calculated prevalence as a function of average arsenic concentrations as reported in the National Hydrochemical Survey , and measured arsenic concentrations in wells used by subjects in the case-control study .	24 2 241
18026622-5	FINDINGS The prevalence of skin lesions was 0.37% in people exposed to arsenic concentrations below 5 microg/L , 0.63% at 6-50 microg/L , and 6.84% at 81 microg/L .	11 24 1 2 241 112
18026622-6	In the case-control analysis , relative risk of skin lesions increased threefold at concentrations above 50 microg/L ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
18026622-7	CONCLUSION Little serious skin disease is likely to occur if the arsenic concentration in drinking water is kept below 50 microg/L , but ensuring this water quality will require systematic surveillance and reliable testing of all wells , which may be impractical .	24 2 241
18026622-8	More research is needed on feasible prevention of toxic effects from arsenic exposure in Bangladesh .	
16882528-0	Alterations in cardiac autonomic control , assessed by changes in heart rate variability ( HRV ) , provide one plausible mechanistic explanation for consistent associations between exposure to airborne particulate matter ( PM ) and increased risks of cardiovascular mortality .	1 11 112
16882528-1	Decreased HRV has been linked with exposures to PM10 ( PM with aerodynamic diameter&lt;or=10 microm ) and with fine particles ( PM with aerodynamic diameter&lt;or=2.5 microm ) originating primarily from combustion sources .	
16882528-2	However , little is known about the relationship between HRV and coarse particles [ PM with aerodynamic diameter 10-2.5 microm ( PM10-2.5) ] , which typically result from entrainment of dust and soil or from mechanical abrasive processes in industry and transportation .	
16882528-3	We measured several HRV variables in 19 nonsmoking older adults with coronary artery disease residing in the Coachella Valley , California , a desert resort and retirement area in which ambient PM10 consists predominantly of PM10-2.5 .	
16882528-4	Study subjects wore Holter monitors for 24 hr once per week for up to 12 weeks during spring 2000 .	
16882528-5	Pollutant concentrations were assessed at nearby fixed-site monitors .	2 231 23
16882528-6	We used mixed models that controlled for individual-specific effects to examine relationships between air pollutants and several HRV metrics .	2 231 23
16882528-7	Decrements in several measures of HRV were consistently associated with both PM10 and PM10-2.5 ; however , there was little relationship of HRV variables with PM2.5 concentrations .	
16882528-8	The magnitude of the associations ( approximately 1-4% decrease in HRV per 10-microg/m3 increase in PM10 or PM10-2.5 ) was comparable with those observed in several other studies of PM .	
16882528-9	Elevated levels of ambient PM10-2.5 may adversely affect HRV in older subjects with coronary artery disease .	
21642045-0	BACKGROUND Epidemiologic evidence for a causative association between black carbon ( BC ) and health outcomes is limited.Objectives : We estimated associations and exposure-response relationships between acute respiratory inflammation in schoolchildren and concentrations of BC and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of â¤ 2.5 Î¼m ( PM2.5 ) in ambient air before and during the air pollution intervention for the 2008 Beijing Olympics .	2 231 23
21642045-1	METHODS We measured exhaled nitric oxide ( eNO ) as an acute respiratory inflammation biomarker and hourly mean air pollutant concentrations to estimate BC and PM2.5 exposure .	11 23 1 11122 1112 111 2
21642045-2	We used 1,581 valid observations of 36 subjects over five visits in 2 years to estimate associations of eNO with BC and PM2.5 according to generalized estimating equations with polynomial distributed-lag models , controlling for body mass index , asthma , temperature , and relative humidity .	2 231 23
21642045-3	We also assessed the relative importance of BC and PM2.5 with two-pollutant models .	
21642045-4	RESULTS Air pollution concentrations and eNO were clearly lower during the 2008 Olympics .	
21642045-5	BC and PM2.5 concentrations averaged over 0-24 hr were strongly associated with eNO , which increased by 16.6% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 14.1-19.2% ] and 18.7% ( 95% CI , 15.0-22.5% ) per interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in BC ( 4.0 Î¼g/m3 ) and PM2.5 ( 149 Î¼g/m3 ) , respectively .	
21642045-6	In the two-pollutant model , estimated effects of BC were robust , but associations between PM2.5 and eNO decreased with adjustment for BC .	
21642045-7	We found that eNO was associated with IQR increases in hourly BC concentrations up to 10 hr after exposure , consistent with effects primarily in the first hours after exposure .	
21642045-8	CONCLUSIONS Recent exposure to BC was associated with acute respiratory inflammation in schoolchildren in Beijing .	
21642045-9	Lower air pollution levels during the 2008 Olympics also were associated with reduced eNO .	
9372633-0	The variation in lead concentration was measured by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry isotope dilution in household tap water throughout the day when the plumbing system was not fully flushed .	24 2 241
9372633-1	After collection of an initial 125-ml water sample containing 119 micrograms/l and a 2-l sample , 125-ml samples were collected at hourly intervals for 8 h .	
9372633-2	The concentrations in the hourly samples remained in the range 35-52 micrograms/l compared with 1.7 micrograms/l for fully flushed water .	
9372633-3	High precision lead isotopic measurements showed that approximately 50% of the lead in these water samples derives from the tap ' housing ' compared with the overall household system .	24 2 241
9372633-4	A health risk assessment was performed employing the US Environmental Protection Agency Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic Model .	2 21
9372633-5	Predicted blood lead levels in infants only exceeded the ' levels of concern ' of 10 micrograms/dl when 100% of the water consumed contained 100 micrograms Pb/1 .	24 2 241 21
9372633-6	It would appear that unless the infant consumed 100% of first flush water at lead concentrations of approximately 100 micrograms/l , the blood lead would not exceed the recommended ' level of concern ' .	
9372633-7	However , if more than 0.51 was consumed in drinks and formulae using first flush water , then the blood lead could easily exceed the recommended level .	
9372633-8	Likewise , a pregnant mother could be at risk of consuming considerably more than the 0.51/day first flush water of the concentrations measured , or throughout the day , if the system were not fully flushed .	24 2 241
9343759-0	The purpose of this study was to determine if hair nicotine and cotinine levels reflect relative exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) in subjects who worked in the hospitality industry , where public smoking was permitted .	2 232 23
9343759-1	Hair samples from 26 subjects were analyzed by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry techniques for nicotine and cotinine .	1 123 12
9343759-2	An exposure gradient was shown for nicotine but not cotinine .	
9343759-3	Among nonsmokers , those working in bars where there are no public smoking restrictions had the highest hair nicotine levels , which were close to levels found in smokers .	1 123 12
9343759-4	Nicotine measured in hair is useful as a biological marker for exposure to ETS from multiple sources .	1 123 12
9343759-5	Bar workers in particular are exposed to high levels of ETS , which may adversely affect the health of nonsmokers .	1 12 123
9200855-0	Thirty-six workers exposed to low or moderate levels of lead at low temperature refining processes were surveyed to examine the route of lead intake .	1 12 123 122
9200855-1	Blood lead level ( BPb ) , delta-aminolevulinic acid in urine , lead in facial skin wipes ( Face-Pb ) and lead in fingernails ( Nail-Pb ) were measured and their personal hygienic behavior was surveyed by a questionnaire .	11 24 12 1 122 123 111 11123 242 2 1112
9200855-2	BPb showed a significant correlation with Face-Pb and Nail-Pb ( r = 0.730 and r = 0.590 , respectively ) .	
9200855-3	Multiple regression analysis extracted the factors of smoking at the workplace , face-Pb and nail-Pb as significantly related to BPb level .	
9200855-4	Electron-microscopic observation revealed that the majority of dust particles collected from worker's faces were larger than respirable size .	
9200855-5	Lead ingestion from contaminated face skin and fingers may contribute to elevations in the BPb level among workers .	24 2 242
9288498-0	Alveolar breath sampling was used to assess trihalomethane ( THM ) exposures encountered by collegiate swimmers during a typical 2-hr training period in an indoor natatorium .	
9288498-1	The breath samples were collected at regular intervals before , during , and for 3 hr after a moderately intense training workout .	1 12 125
9288498-2	Integrated and grab whole-air samples were collected during the training period to help determine inhalation exposures , and pool water samples were collected to help assess dermal exposures .	2 22 232 23
9288498-3	Resulting breath samples collected during the workout demonstrated a rapid uptake of two THMs ( chloroform and bromodichloromethane ) , with chloroform concentrations exceeding the natatorium air levels within 8 min after the exposure began .	
9288498-4	Chloroform levels continued to rise steeply until they were more than two times the indoor levels , providing evidence that the dermal route of exposure was relatively rapid and ultimately more important than the inhalation route in this training scenario .	
9288498-5	Chloroform elimination after the exposure period was fitted to a three compartment model that allowed estimation of compartmental half-lives , resulting minimum bloodborne dose , and an approximation of the duration of elevated body burdens .	
9288498-6	We estimated the dermal exposure route to account for 80% of the blood chloroform concentration and the transdermal diffusion efficiency from the water to the blood to in excess of 2% .	2 22
9288498-7	Bromodichloromethane elimination was fitted to a two compartment model which provided evidence of a small , but measurable , body burden of this THM resulting from vigorous swim training .	
9288498-8	These results suggest that trihalomethane exposures for competitive swimmers under prolonged , high-effort training are common and possibly higher than was previously thought and that the dermal exposure route is dominant .	
9288498-9	The exposures and potential risks associated with this common recreational activity should be more thoroughly investigated .	
16882544-0	OBJECTIVE We set out to assess whether environmental prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) is associated with incidence of acute respiratory infections in preschool Inuit children .	
16882544-1	STUDY DESIGN We reviewed the medical charts of 343 children from 0 to 5 years of age and evaluated the associations between PCB-153 concentration in umbilical cord plasma and the incidence rates of acute otitis media ( AOM ) and of upper and lower respiratory tract infections ( URTIs and LRTIs , respectively ) .	1 122 12
16882544-2	RESULTS The incidence rates of AOM and LRTIs were positively associated with prenatal exposure to PCBs .	
16882544-3	Compared with children in the first quartile of exposure ( least exposed ) , children in fourth quartile ( most exposed ) had rate ratios of 1.25 ( p&lt;0.001 ) and 1.40 ( p&lt;0.001 ) for AOM and LRTIs , respectively .	
16882544-4	There was no association between prenatal PCB exposure and incidence rate of URTIs or hospitalization .	
16882544-5	CONCLUSION Prenatal exposure to PCBs could be responsible for a significant portion of respiratory infections in children of this population .	
16899281-0	This communication presents results of our 2-year survey on groundwater arsenic contamination in three districts Ballia , Varanasi and Gazipur of Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) in the upper and middle Ganga plain , India .	
16899281-1	Analyses of 4,780 tubewell water samples revealed that arsenic concentrations in 46.5% exceeded 10 microg/L , in 26.7% , 50 microg/L and in 10% 300 microg/L limits .	24 2 241
16899281-2	Arsenic concentrations up to 3,192 microg//L were observed .	
16899281-3	The age of tubewells ( n=1,881 ) ranged from less than a year to 32 years , with an average of 6.5 years .	
16899281-4	Our study shows that older tubewells had a greater chance of contamination .	
16899281-5	Depth of tubewells ( n=3,810 ) varied from 6 to 60.5 m with a mean of 25.75 m .	
16899281-6	A detailed study in three administrative units within Ballia district , i.e. block , Gram Panchayet , and village was carried out to assess the magnitude of the contamination .	
16899281-7	Before our survey the affected villagers were not aware that they were suffering from arsenical toxicity through contaminated drinking water .	
16899281-8	A preliminary clinical examination in 11 affected villages ( 10 from Ballia and 1 from Gazipur district ) revealed typical arsenical skin lesions ranging from melanosis , keratosis to Bowens ( suspected ) .	1 11 112
16899281-9	Out of 989 villagers ( 691 adults , and 298 children ) screened , 137 ( 19.8% ) of the adults and 17 ( 5.7% ) of the children were diagnosed to have typical arsenical skin lesions .	24 12 1 123 241 127 2
16899281-10	Arsenical neuropathy and adverse obstetric outcome were also observed , indicating severity of exposure .	1 11 112
16899281-11	The range of arsenic concentrations in hair , nail and urine was 137-10,900 , 764-19,700 microg/kg , and 23-4,030 microg/L , respectively .	1 123 12 127
16899281-12	The urine , hair and nail concentrations of arsenic correlated significantly ( r=0.76 , 0.61 , and 0.55 , respectively ) with drinking water arsenic concentrations .	24 12 1 123 241 127 2
16899281-13	The similarity to previous studies on arsenic contamination in West Bengal , Bihar and Bangladesh indicates that people from a significant part of the surveyed areas in UP are suffering and this will spread unless drives to raise awareness of arsenic toxicity are undertaken and an arsenic safe water supply is immediately introduced .	
16902370-0	OBJECTIVE We examined the association between ambient air pollution levels and heart rate variability ( HRV ) in a panel study of 32 subjects .	11 1 2 112 23
16902370-1	METHODS We used linear mixed models to analyze the effects of fine particles ( PM2.5 ) , sulfate ( SO4 ) , elemental carbon ( EC ) , and gases on log-transformed standard deviation of normal RR intervals ( SDNN ) , mean square of differences between adjacent RR intervals ( r-MSSD ) , and high- and low-frequency power ( HF , LF ) .	
16902370-2	RESULTS An interquartile range ( IQR ) increase of 5.1 mug/m in SO4 on the previous day was associated with a decrease of -3.3% SDNN ( 95% confidence = -6.0% to -0.5% ) , -5.6% r-MSSD ( -10.7% to -0.2% ) , and -10.3% HF ( -19.5% to -0.1% ) .	2 231 23
16902370-3	Associations with total PM2.5 were similar .	
16902370-4	HRV was not associated with EC , NO2 , SO2 , or O3 .	
16902370-5	CONCLUSION In addition to traffic-related particles , elevated levels of sulfate particles may also adversely affect autonomic function .	
21601239-0	The risks and benefits of using mercury ( Hg ) in dental amalgam have long been debated .	
21601239-1	This study was designed to estimate Hg body burden and its association with dental amalgam fillings in 182 children ( ages : 5-15 years ) living in Taif City .	24 12 1 244 123 127 2
21601239-2	Hg was measured in urine ( UHg ) , hair ( HHg ) and toenails ( NHg ) by the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer with Vapor Generator Accessory system .	1 123 12 127
21601239-3	Urinary Hg levels were calculated as both micrograms per gram creatinine ( Î¼g/g creatinine ) and micrograms per liter ( Î¼g/L ) .	1 12 127
21601239-4	We found that children with amalgam fillings ( N=106 ) had significantly higher UHg-C levels than children without ( N=76 ) , with means of 3.763 Î¼g/g creatinine versus 3.457 Î¼g/g creatinine , respectively ( P=0.019 ) .	24 244 2
21601239-5	The results were similar for UHg ( P=0.01 ) .	
21601239-6	A similar pattern was also seen for HHg , with means of 0.614 Î¼g/g ( N=97 ) for children with amalgam versus 0.242 Î¼g/g ( N=74 ) for those without amalgam fillings ( P=0 ) .	24 244 2
21601239-7	Although the mean NHg was higher in children without amalgam ( 0.222 Î¼g/g , N=61 ) versus those with ( 0.163 Î¼g/g , N=101 ) , the relationship was not significant ( P=0.069 ) .	
21601239-8	After adjusting for many confounders , the multiple logistic regression model revealed that the levels of UHg-C and HHg were 2.047 and 5.396 times higher , respectively , in children with dental amalgam compared to those without ( P&lt;0.01 ) .	24 244 2
21601239-9	In contrast , a significant inverse relationship was seen between NHg levels and dental amalgam fillings ( P=0.003 ) .	
21601239-10	Despite the controversy surrounding the health impact of dental amalgam , this study showed some evidence that amalgam-associated Hg exposure might be related with symptoms of oral health , such as aphthous ulcer , white patches , and a burning-mouth sensation .	
21601239-11	Further studies are needed to reproduce these findings .	
21601239-12	The present study showed that significant numbers of children with or without amalgam had Hg levels exceeding the acceptable reference limits .	
21601239-13	The detrimental neurobehavioral and/or nephrotoxic effects of such an increased Hg on children should be a cause of concern , and further investigation is warranted .	
21601239-14	Our results are alarming and indicate an urgent need for biomonitoring and assessment of exposure .	
21601239-15	Changes in dental practices involving amalgam , especially for children , are highly recommended in order to avoid unnecessary exposure to Hg .	
21883058-0	This cross-sectional study measures the arsenic level in school children exposed to contaminated well water in a rural area in MÃ©xico .	24 2 241
21883058-1	Arsenic was measured in hair by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometry .	1 123 12
21883058-2	Overall , 110 children were included ( average 10 years-old ) .	
21883058-3	Among 55 exposed children , mean arsenic level on hair was 1.3 mg/kg ( range &lt;0.006-5.9 ) .	1 123 12
21883058-4	All unexposed children had undetectable arsenic levels .	
21883058-5	The high level of arsenic in water was associated to the level in hair .	24 12 1 123 241 2
21883058-6	However , exposed children drank less well water at school or at home than unexposed children , suggesting that the use of contaminated water to cook beans , broths or soups may be the source of arsenic exposure .	24 2 241
16912698-0	New England is one of three areas in the United States with the highest annual deposition of mercury , an established environmental pollutant with a variety of health effects .	
16912698-1	We measured the mercury content in toenails of 27 individuals in New Hampshire who participated as controls in a health study in 1994-95 .	1 123 12
16912698-2	The mean total toenail mercury concentration was 0.27 mcg/g ( median 0.16 ; SD 0.27 ; range 0.04-1.15 mcg/g ) .	
16912698-3	The best predictor of toenail mercury levels was the mean combined fish and shellfish consumption measured using four simple questions from a validated food frequency questionnaire .	24 2 243
16912698-4	Toenail total mercury content was significantly correlated with the mean average weekly consumption of finfish and shellfish ( Spearman correlation coefficient 0.48 , P=0.012 ) .	24 12 1 123 243 2
16912698-5	Multivariate models confirmed that toenail total mercury concentration was best predicted by total finfish and shellfish consumption .	24 2 243
21587306-0	Children living near hazardous waste sites may be exposed to environmental contaminants , yet few studies have conducted multi-media exposure assessments , including residential environments where children spend most of their time .	
21587306-1	We sampled yard soil , house dust , and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 in 59 homes of young children near an abandoned mining area and analyzed samples for lead ( Pb ) , zinc ( Zn ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , arsenic ( As ) , and manganese ( Mn ) .	24 23 245 2 242 232
21587306-2	In over half of the homes , dust concentrations of Pb , Zn , Cd , and As were higher than those in soil .	24 2 242
21587306-3	Proximity to mine waste ( chat ) piles and the presence of chat in the driveway significantly predicted dust metals levels .	
21587306-4	Homes with both chat sources had Pb , Zn , Cd , and As dust levels two to three times higher than homes with no known chat sources after controlling for other sources .	
21587306-5	In contrast , Mn concentrations in dust were consistently lower than in soil and were not associated with chat sources .	245 24 2 242
21587306-6	Mn dust concentrations were predicted by soil concentrations and occupant density .	245 24 2 242
21587306-7	These findings suggest that nearby outdoor sources of metal contaminants from mine waste may migrate indoors .	
21587306-8	Populations farther away from the mining site may also be exposed if secondary uses of chat are in close proximity to the home .	
16913117-0	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were measured in air ( using PUF disk passive samplers ) in 31 homes , 33 offices , 25 cars , and 3 public microenvironments .	2 232 23
16913117-1	Average concentrations of sigmaBDE ( 273 pg m(-3) ) and sigmaPCB ( 8920 pg m(-3) ) were an order of magnitude higher than those previously reported for outdoor air .	
16913117-2	Cars were the most contaminated microenvironment for sigmaBDE ( average = 709 pg m(-3) ) , but the least for sigmaPCB ( average = 1391 pg m(-3) ) .	
16913117-3	Comparison with data from a previous spatially consistent study , revealed no significant decline in concentrations of sigmaPCB in indoor air since 1997-98 .	
16913117-4	Concentrations in indoor dust from 8 homes were on average 215.2 ng sigmaBDE g(-1) , slightly higher than other European dust samples , but twenty times lower than Canadian samples .	24 2 242
16913117-5	Inhalation makes an important contribution ( between 4.2 and 63% for adults ) to overall UK exposure to sigmaPCB .	
16913117-6	For sigmaBDE , dust ingestion makes a significant but--in contrast to Canada-a not overwhelming contribution ( up to 37% for adults , and 69% for toddlers ) .	24 2 242
16913117-7	Comparison of UK and Canadian estimates of absolute exposure to sigmaBDE suggest that differences in dust contamination are the likely cause of higher PBDE body burdens in North Americans compared to Europeans .	24 2 242
21576319-0	Elevated concentrations of arsenic in groundwater pose a public health threat to millions of people worldwide .	
21576319-1	The authors aimed to evaluate the association between arsenic exposure and skin lesion incidence among participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) .	1 11 112
21576319-2	The analyses used data on 10,182 adults free of skin lesions at baseline through the third biennial follow-up of the cohort ( 2000-2009 ) .	
21576319-3	Discrete-time hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident skin lesions .	
21576319-4	Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for incident skin lesions comparing 10.1-50.0 , 50.1-100.0 , 100.1-200.0 , and â¥200.1 Î¼g/L with â¤10.0 Î¼g/L of well water arsenic exposure were 1.17 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.92 , 1.49 ) , 1.69 ( 95% CI : 1.33 , 2.14 ) , 1.97 ( 95% CI : 1.58 , 2.46 ) , and 2.98 ( 95% CI : 2.40 , 3.71 ) , respectively ( P(trend) = 0.0001 ) .	24 2 241
21576319-5	Results were similar for the other measures of arsenic exposure , and the increased risks remained unchanged with changes in exposure in recent years .	
21576319-6	Dose-dependent associations were more pronounced in females , but the incidence of skin lesions was greater in males and older individuals .	
21576319-7	Chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water was associated with increased incidence of skin lesions , even at low levels of arsenic exposure ( &lt;100 Î¼g/L ) .	11 24 1 2 241 112
19160059-0	The total mercury ( T-Hg ) and methyl mercury ( Me-Hg ) concentrations in the hair were measured to evaluate mercury ( Hg ) exposure for the residents in Da-shui-xi Village ( DSX ) and Xia-chang-xi Village ( XCX ) in the Wanshan Hg mining area , Guizhou Province , Southwestern China .	1 123 12
19160059-1	The mean concentrations in the hair of DSX residents were 5.5 Â± 2.7 Î¼g/g and 1.9 Â± 0.9 Î¼g/g for T-Hg and Me-Hg , respectively .	1 123 12
19160059-2	The concentrations in the hair of XCX residents were 3.3 Â± 1.4 Î¼g/g and 1.2 Â± 0.5 Î¼g/g for T-Hg and Me-Hg , respectively .	1 123 12
19160059-3	Hair Me-Hg concentrations were significantly correlated to T-Hg ( r = 0.42 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) in the two sites ; on average , hair Me-Hg concentration accounted for 40 and 44% of T-Hg for DSX and XCX residents , respectively .	
19160059-4	Age has no obvious correlation with hair Hg and the hair Hg levels showed a significant gender difference , with higher T-Hg and Me-Hg concentrations in the hair from males than females .	
19160059-5	The rice collected from the two sites showed high levels of T-Hg and Me-Hg concentration .	24 2 243
19160059-6	The results indicated a certain Hg exposure for the residents in DSX and XCX in the Wanshan Hg mining area .	
16949631-0	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) were measured in samples of human blood serum taken from 23 donors in Wellington , New Zealand .	1 122 12
16949631-1	Concentrations expressed as the sum of congeners 47 , 99 , 100 , 153 , 154 , and 183 ( SigmaPBDE ) were - at an average of 7.17 ng SigmaPBDE g ( lipid)(-1 ) - within the range reported for human tissues in Europe , but lower than in Australia and North America .	
16949631-2	The most likely source of this contamination is considered to be the release of PBDEs from imported consumer goods .	
16949631-3	The congener pattern observed is in line with that reported for human tissues outside North America , but shows a lower contribution of PBDE 47 to SigmaPBDE than observed in North Americans .	
16949631-4	No significant ( p&gt;0.1 ) differences between concentrations in males and females were detected , and no relationship between donor age and SigmaPBDE concentration was observed .	
16949631-5	One donor displayed concentrations that were significantly elevated ( i.e. &gt ; average +2 standard deviations ) above those in others in this study .	
16962637-0	There is no previous report from Turkey on chemically determined polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in human tissues expressed as World Health Organization ( WHO ) toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) .	
16962637-1	The objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of PCDDs/Fs , and dioxin-like PCBs in the general adult Turkish population .	
16962637-2	For this reason we measured adipose tissue concentrations of PCDDs/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in 23 Turkish men living in Ankara,Turkey in 2004 .	1 121 12
16962637-3	PCDD/F concentrations ranged between 3.2 and 19.7 pg WHO-TEQ/g fat ( 5.34 and 42.7 WHO-TEQ/g fat , respectively , including dioxin-like PCBs ) .	
16962637-4	The mean concentrations of WHO(PCDD/F)-TEQ and WHO(PCB)-TEQ were 9.2 and 6.67 pg/g on a lipid basis , respectively .	
16962637-5	Samples were analyzed for PCDD/F and twelve dioxin-like PCB congeners using high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry ( HRGC/HRMS ) .	
16962637-6	This study is very important since it is the first report on PCDDs/Fs and dioxin-like PCB contamination in human adipose tissue from Turkey .	1 121 12
21555245-0	Tobacco smoke is a major source of adult exposure to cadmium ( Cd ) .	
21555245-1	Urine Cd levels ( CdU ) above 1.0 , 0.7 , and 0.5 Î¼gCd/g creatinine have been associated with increased rates of microproteinuria and reduction in glomerular filtration rate .	1 12 127
21555245-2	The two study objectives were to determine the prevalence and relative risk ( RR ) by smoking status for CdU above 1.0 , 0.7 , and 0.5 Î¼gCd/g creatinine in U.S. adults ; and to describe geometric mean CdU by smoking status , age , and sex .	
21555245-3	NHANES 1999-2006 data for adults without chronic kidney disease were used to compute prevalence rates above the three CdU in current and former cigarette smokers , and non-smokers .	
21555245-4	RRs for smokers adjusted for age and sex were computed by logistic regression .	
21555245-5	Analysis of covariance was used to calculate geometric means of CdU adjusted for age , sex , smoking status , log urine creatinine , and interaction terms : age-smoking status and sex-smoking status .	
21555245-6	At selected ages , adjusted RR for exceeding each risk-associated CdU was highest for current smokers ( 3-13 times ) , followed by former smokers ( 2-3 times ) , compared to non-smokers .	
21555245-7	Adjusted RR for smokers increased with age and was higher in females than males .	
21555245-8	Adjusted geometric means of CdUs increased with age , were higher in females than in males regardless of smoking status , and were higher in current smokers than former smokers , who had higher levels than non-smokers at any age .	
21555245-9	Cigarette smoking greatly increases RR of exceeding renal risk-associated CdU .	
21555245-10	Former smokers retain significant risk of exceeding these levels compared to non-smokers .	
21555245-11	CdU increased with age , particularly in current smokers .	
19241261-0	Ninety-seven subjects belonging to 40 families in a village in Cambodia were examined in a health camp where all the cases with skin disease assembled .	
19241261-1	These people had evidences of chronic arsenic exposure from reports of testing of water samples and of hair and/or nail studied .	24 12 1 123 241 2
19241261-2	Seventy cases were diagnosed to be suffering from arsenicosis ( Clinically and laboratory confirmed according to WHO criteria ) as all these cases had evidences of pigmentation and/or keratosis characteristic of arsenicosis and history of exposure of arsenic contaminated water and/or elevated level of arsenic in hair and/or in nail .	11 24 12 1 123 241 112 2
19241261-3	Highest number of cases belonged to age group of 31 to 45 yrs , both the sexes are more or less affected equally .	
19241261-4	Evidence of both pigmentation and keratosis were found in 60 cases ( 85.7% ) while only pigmentation and only keratosis was found in 6 ( 8.5% ) and 4 ( 5.7% ) cases respectively .	
19241261-5	It was interesting to find 37.04% of children below the age of 16 years had skin lesions of arsenicosis .	24 11 12 1 123 241 112 2
19241261-6	The youngest child having definite evidence of keratosis and pigmentation was aged 8 years , though two children aged 4 and 5 yrs had feature of redness and mild thickening of the palms .	
19241261-7	The minimum and maximum arsenic values detected in the nails were 1.06 and 69.48 mg/Kg respectively and the minimum and maximum arsenic values in hair were 0.92 and 25.6 mg/Kg respectively .	1 123 12
19241261-8	No correlation was observed between arsenic concentration in drinking water and arsenic level in nail and hair .	24 12 1 123 241 2
19241261-9	This is the first report of clinical and laboratory confirmed cases of arsenicosis in Cambodia .	
16963109-0	BACKGROUND Data on mercury exposure of the Austrian population were inadequate .	
16963109-1	This study was performed to determine the causal factors underlying mercury exposure and selenium concentrations , and to estimate the gender-related health impacts .	
16963109-2	METHODOLOGY Venous blood samples of 78 women and 81 men were drawn at the Austrian Red Cross , Vienna .	1 122 12
16963109-3	Mercury contents in acid-digested whole blood samples were measured after amalgam enrichment by CV-AAS , and selenium by AAS ( heated quartz-cell ) after hydrid formation .	1 122 12
16963109-4	RESULTS The average total mercury blood content of Austrians was low ( 2.38+/-1.55 microgL(-1) ; N=152 ) .	1 122 12
16963109-5	Mercury and selenium concentrations were not different between the genders ( P&gt;0.05 ) but we observed discrepancies regarding the causal factors .	
16963109-6	Mercury levels in men were influenced not only by fish consumption but also by age , education level , and amalgam fillings , whereas in women , only the diet ( fish/seafood , red wine consumption ) determined blood mercury ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	24 244 2 243
16963109-7	Moreover , only the males indicated a depressive effect of dental amalgam on hematocrit ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	11 24 1 244 1113 2 111
16963109-8	Regarding selenium , age and alcohol consumption led to lower concentrations in men , whereas a high-level education had the opposite effect ; no determinant was found for women .	
16963109-9	For the whole study group , a significant effect of chronic disease on selenium levels could be detected ( P&lt;0.05). 18% of women and 13% of men showed marginal selenium deficiency ( blood selenium&lt;65 microgL(-1) ) .	
16963109-10	Selenium and mercury concentrations were not correlated .	
16963109-11	CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate the need to evaluate and integrate gender-related findings in metal toxicology and trace element research , because different causal factors require different preventive measures to reduce mercury exposure and the risk of low selenium concentrations .	
16963109-12	Future research is needed on the gender- and age-related differences in fish/seafood consumption habits , the modifications of mercury toxicokinetics through sex hormones , the selenium supply in Austria , and the clinical relevance of a low selenium status .	
19287062-0	BACKGROUND &amp ; OBJECTIVE Pigmentation and keratosis are the prerequisites to diagnose arsenicosis .	
19287062-1	However , many systemic manifestations occur in association with pigmentation and keratosis in people exposed to chronic drinking of arsenic contaminated water .	
19287062-2	The present study aim to find out whether systemic manifestations occur in significant number of cases in arsenic exposed people in the absence of skin lesions in an affected district in West Bengal , India .	
19287062-3	METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out in South 24 Parganas , an arsenic affected district of West Bengal , India .	
19287062-4	Both dermatological and systemic manifestations were recorded and water samples collected for arsenic analysis from 7683 participants .	24 2 241
19287062-5	A correlation of systemic manifestations in relation to arsenic exposure was carried out in subjects having no arsenical skin lesion .	
19287062-6	Prevalence odds ratio ( POR ) was calculated for each outcome comparing those with high arsenic exposure with those with lowest exposure .	
19287062-7	RESULTS The frequency of occurrence of various clinical manifestations like weakness , anaemia , diarrhoea , hepatomegaly and lung disease was found to be significantly higher among participants drinking water having arsenic concentration &gt ; or = 50 microg/l in comparison to those taking water with arsenic content below this level .	24 2 241
19287062-8	Further , there was increased occurrence of these manifestations with increasing concentration of arsenic level in drinking water , and this followed a dose-response relationship .	24 2 241
19287062-9	INTERPRETATION &amp ; CONCLUSION It appears that it is worthwhile to include people with systemic manifestations in absence of skin lesions with evidence of arsenic exposure as suspected cases of arsenicosis for case detection and in surveillance programme .	
16966098-0	BACKGROUND Otitis media is one of the most common infections in young children .	
16966098-1	Although exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a known risk factor associated with otitis media , little information is available regarding the potential association with air pollution .	
16966098-2	OBJECTIVE We set out to study the relationship between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and otitis media in two birth cohorts .	
16966098-3	METHODS Individual estimates of outdoor concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants-nitrogen dioxide , fine particles [ particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters &lt;/= 2.5 microm ( PM2.5) ] , and elemental carbon-were calculated for home addresses of approximately 3,700 and 650 infants from birth cohort studies in the Netherlands and Germany , respectively .	2 231 23
16966098-4	Air pollution exposure was analyzed in relation to physician diagnosis of otitis media in the first 2 years of life .	2 23
16966098-5	RESULTS Odds ratios ( adjusted for known major risk factors ) for otitis media indicated positive associations with traffic-related air pollutants .	
16966098-6	An increase in 3 microg/m3 PM2.5 , 0.5 microg/m3 elemental carbon , and 10 microg/m3 NO2 was associated with odds ratios of 1.13 ( 95% confidence interval , 1.00-1.27 ) , 1.10 ( 1.00-1.22 ) , and 1.14 ( 1.03-1.27 ) in the Netherlands and 1.24 ( 0.84-1.83 ) , 1.10 ( 0.86-1.41 ) , and 1.14 ( 0.87-1.49 ) in Germany , respectively .	
16966098-7	CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate an association between exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and the incidence of otitis media .	
16966098-8	Given the ubiquitous nature of air pollution exposure and the importance of otitis media to children's health , these findings have significant public health implications .	
19322015-0	Arsenic exposure is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer .	
19322015-1	To explore the distribution of the arsenic methylation capability and myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) and sulfotransferase ( SULT ) 1A1 genotypes in patients at different stages and grades of urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) , 112 UC cases were recruited between September 2002 and May 2004 for this study .	
19322015-2	Urinary arsenic species , including inorganic arsenic ( As(III) + As(V) ) , monomethylarsonic acid , and dimethylarsinic acid , were determined with a high-performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry .	1 12 127
19322015-3	The MPO and SULT1A1 genotypes were examined with polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism .	
19322015-4	Differential effects of the arsenic methylation capability were found among patients with different stages of UC ; however , urinary arsenic concentrations were borderline significantly increased with the progress of UC patients regardless of whether or not they had been exposed to arsenic from drinking water .	1 12 127
19322015-5	The MPO and SULT genetic polymorphisms might modify the arsenic methylation profile and UC progression , and thus are worthy of further investigation .	
16966102-0	OBJECTIVE To explore possible associations between autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) and environmental exposures , we linked the California autism surveillance system to estimated hazardous air pollutant ( HAP ) concentrations compiled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .	
16966102-1	METHODS Subjects included 284 children with ASD and 657 controls , born in 1994 in the San Francisco Bay area .	
16966102-2	We assigned exposure level by census tract of birth residence for 19 chemicals we identified as potential neurotoxicants , developmental toxicants , and/or endocrine disruptors from the 1996 HAPs database .	2 231 23
16966102-3	Because concentrations of many of these were highly correlated , we combined the chemicals into mechanistic and structural groups , calculating summary index scores .	
16966102-4	We calculated ASD risk in the upper quartiles of these group scores or individual chemical concentrations compared with below the median , adjusting for demographic factors .	
16966102-5	RESULTS The adjusted odds ratios ( AORs ) were elevated by 50% in the top quartile of chlorinated solvents and heavy metals [ 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) , 1.1-2.1 ] , but not for aromatic solvents .	
16966102-6	Adjusting for these three groups simultaneously led to decreased risks for the solvents and increased risk for metals ( AORs for metals : fourth quartile = 1.7 ; 95% CI , 1.0-3.0 ; third quartile = 1.95 ; 95% CI , 1.2-3.1 ) .	
16966102-7	The individual compounds that contributed most to these associations included mercury , cadmium , nickel , trichloroethylene , and vinyl chloride .	
16966102-8	CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest a potential association between autism and estimated metal concentrations , and possibly solvents , in ambient air around the birth residence , requiring confirmation and more refined exposure assessment in future studies .	2 231 23
21543280-0	BACKGROUND Methylmercury ( MeHg ) exposure has been linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) .	
21543280-1	Paraoxonase 1 ( PON1 ) , an enzyme located in the high-density-lipoprotein ( HDL ) fraction of blood lipids , may protect against CHD by metabolizing toxic oxidized lipids associated with low-density liproprotein and HDL .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21543280-2	MeHg has been shown to inhibit PON1 activity in vitro , but this effect has not been studied in human populations.Objectives : This study was conducted to determine whether blood mercury levels are linked to decreased plasma PON1 activities in Inuit people who are highly exposed to MeHg through their seafood-based diet .	1 122 12
21543280-3	METHODS We measured plasma PON1 activity using a fluorogenic substrate and blood concentrations of mercury and selenium by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in 896 Inuit adults .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 1112
21543280-4	Sociodemographic , anthropometric , clinical , dietary , and lifestyle variables as well as PON1 gene variants ( rs705379 , rs662 , rs854560 ) were considered as possible confounders or modifiers of the mercury-PON1 relation in multivariate analyses.Results : In a multiple regression model adjusted for age , HDL cholesterol levels , omega-3 fatty acid content of erythrocyte membranes , and PON1 variants , blood mercury concentrations were inversely associated with PON1 activities [ Î²-coefficient = -0.063 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , -0.091 to -0.035 ; p &lt ; 0.001 ] , whereas blood selenium concentrations were positively associated with PON1 activities ( Î²-coefficient = 0.067 ; 95% CI , 0.045-0.088 ; p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
21543280-5	We found no interaction between blood mercury levels and PON1 genotypes .	
21543280-6	CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that MeHg exposure exerts an inhibitory effect on PON1 activity , which seems to be offset by selenium intake .	
19354185-0	The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of highly mineralized drinking water on children's health .	24 2 241
19354185-1	To reveal a relationship of children's health to the chemical composition of portable water , two Kazan districts differing in the conditions of water supply and the mineral composition of the water were selected .	24 2 241
19354185-2	A total of 833 schoolchildren aged 7-9 years underwent a questionnaire survey and their objective status was examined .	1 12 127
19354185-3	Special methods were used to determine the urinary content of trace elements , such as copper , zinc , cadmium , and gross elements , such as calcium and magnesium , by performing atomic absorption spectrophotometry on an AAS-SA 10 MP apparatus .	1 12 127
19359076-0	Elevated concentrations of arsenic were detected in surface soils adjacent to a smelting complex in northern Canada .	245 24 2
19359076-1	We evaluated the cancer risks caused by exposure to arsenic in two communities through combining geostatistical simulation with demographic data and dose-response models in a framework .	
19359076-2	Distribution of arsenic was first estimated using geostatistical circulant-embedding simulation method .	
19359076-3	We then evaluated the exposures from inadvertent ingestion , inhalation and dermal contact .	24 2 22 23
19359076-4	Risks of skin cancer and three internal cancers were estimated at both grid scale and census-unit scale using parametric dose-response models .	
19359076-5	Results indicated that local residents could face non-negligible cancer risks ( skin cancer and liver cancer mainly ) .	
19359076-6	Uncertainties of risk estimates were discussed from the aspects of arsenic concentrations , exposed population and dose-response model .	
19359076-7	Reducing uncertainties would require additional soil sampling , epidemic records as well as complementary studies on land use , demographic variation , outdoor activities and bioavailability of arsenic .	
21531441-0	Perfluorinated alkyl acids ( PFAAs ) are persistent environmental pollutants , found in the serum of human populations internationally .	
21531441-1	Due to concerns regarding their bioaccumulation , and possible health effects , an understanding of routes of human exposure is necessary .	
21531441-2	PFAAs are recalcitrant in many water treatment processes , making drinking water a potential source of human exposure .	
21531441-3	This study was conducted with the aim of assessing the exposure to PFAAs via potable water in Australia .	
21531441-4	Sixty-two samples of potable water , collected from 34 locations across Australia , including capital cities and regional centers .	
21531441-5	The samples were extracted by solid phase extraction and analyzed via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry for a range of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfonates .	
21531441-6	PFOS and PFOA were the most commonly detected PFAAs , quantifiable in 49% and 44% of all samples respectively .	
21531441-7	The maximum concentration in any sample was seen for PFOS with a concentration of 16 ng L(-1) , second highest maximums were for PFHxS and PFOA at 13 and 9.7 ng L(-1) .	
21531441-8	The contribution of drinking water to daily PFOS and PFOA intakes in Australia was estimated .	24 2 241
21531441-9	Assuming a daily intake of 1.4 and 0.8 ng kg(-1) bw for PFOS and PFOA the average contribution from drinking water was 2-3% with a maximum of 22% and 24% respectively .	24 2 241
21531025-0	Sixty breast milk samples were collected in Shenzhen , China from July to November in 2007 .	1 12 124
21531025-1	The samples were analyzed of the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .	
21531025-2	The range of upper-bound for âTEQ-(PCDD/Fs+PCBs) in the samples was 4.10-35.3 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid ( median : 10.6 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid ; mean : 11.9 pg TEQ g(-1) lipid ) .	
21531025-3	The levels of the measured contaminants in the breast milk had significant correlations with the length of inhabitation period in Shenzhen ( r=0.487 , p&lt;0.05 for PCDD/Fs , r=0.431 , p&lt;0.05 for PCBs and r=0.478 , p&lt;0.05 for âTEQ-(PCDD/Fs+PCBs) ) , and the consumption rate of fish ( r=0.366 , p&lt;0.05 for PCDD/Fs , r=0.486 , p&lt;0.05 for PCBs and r=0.416 , p&lt;0.05 for âTEQ-(PCDD/Fs+PCBs) ) , respectively .	24 12 1 2 124 243
21531025-4	Moreover , significant positive correlations were also detected between the participant's age ( r=0.305 , p&lt;0.05 for âTEQ-PCBs and r=0.275 , p&lt;0.05 for âTEQ-(PCDD/Fs+PCBs) ) and the body burdens of these contaminants respectively .	
21531025-5	It is estimated that the daily intake ( EDI ) of the sum of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs by the breast-fed infants was 5.60-161 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw per day ( mean : 48.2 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw per day ; median : 42.2 pg TEQ kg(-1) bw per day ) .	24 2 243
21531025-6	The result showed that both the body burdens of PCDD/Fs and PCBs of the recruit population and the calculated EDI of the breast-fed infants were higher than those in the non-exposed areas in mainland China .	24 2 243
21531025-7	This suggests that continuous surveillance on PCDD/Fs and PCBs levels in human milk is critical to more precisely evaluate the human health risk posed by the negative environmental impact in Shenzhen in the future .	
21527364-0	BACKGROUND Animal data demonstrate associations of dioxin , furan , and polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) exposures with altered male gonadal maturation .	
21527364-1	It is unclear whether these associations apply to human populations .	
21527364-2	OBJECTIVES We investigated the association of dioxins , furans , PCBs , and corresponding toxic equivalent ( TEQ ) concentrations with pubertal onset among boys in a dioxin-contaminated region .	
21527364-3	METHODS Between 2003 and 2005 , 499 boys 8-9 years of age were enrolled in a longitudinal study in Chapaevsk , Russia .	1 122 12
21527364-4	Pubertal onset [ stage 2 or higher for genitalia ( G2+ ) or testicular volume ( TV ) &gt ; 3 mL ] was assessed annually between ages 8 and 12 years .	1 11 112
21527364-5	Serum levels at enrollment were analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , Georgia , USA .	1 122 12
21527364-6	We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess age at pubertal onset as a function of exposure adjusted for potential confounders .	
21527364-7	We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding boys with pubertal onset at enrollment .	
21527364-8	RESULTS The median ( range ) total serum TEQ concentration was 21 ( 4-175 ) pg/g lipid , approximately three times higher than values in European children .	1 122 12
21527364-9	At enrollment , boys were generally healthy and normal weight ( mean body mass index , 15.9 kg/m2 ) , with 30% having entered puberty by G2+ and 14% by TV criteria .	
21527364-10	Higher dioxin TEQs were associated with later pubertal onset by TV ( hazard ratio = 0.68 , 95% confidence interval , 0.49-0.95 for the highest compared with the lowest quartile ) .	
21527364-11	Similar associations were observed for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and dioxin concentrations for TV but not G2+ .	
21527364-12	Results were robust to sensitivity analyses .	
21527364-13	CONCLUSIONS Findings support an association of higher peripubertal serum dioxin TEQs and concentrations with later male pubertal onset reflected in delayed testicular maturation .	
19404591-0	In the research , the contents of heavy metals , Al , Cd and Pb , in the hair of individuals who reside in similar environmental conditions were spectrometrically determined with the use of atomic emission spectrometryâinductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer .	1 123 12
19404591-1	The relation to their tobacco smoking habit , age and sex was established .	
19404591-2	It was observed that the level of all three determined elements was generally higher in the hair of smokers in comparison to hair of non-smokers in both younger and older age groups .	1 123 12
19404591-3	In addition , it has been observed that , in the group of elderly people over 50 years old , there was an increase in the content of aluminium , cadmium and lead both in smokers and non-smokers , irrespective of their sex .	
19404591-4	The sex-related differences in the content of the investigated elements were not unidirectional , and only in few cases did they reveal statistical significance .	
17003688-0	BACKGROUND Phthalates are multifunctional chemicals used in a variety of consumer , medical , and personal care products .	
17003688-1	Previously , we reported dose-response associations of decreased semen quality with urinary concentrations of monobutyl phthalate ( MBP ) and monobenzyl ( MBzP ) phthalate , which are metabolites of dibutyl phthalate and butylbenzyl phthalate , respectively .	
17003688-2	The present study extends our work in a larger sample of men and includes measurements of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) oxidative metabolites .	
17003688-3	METHODS Between January 2000 and May 2004 , we recruited 463 male partners of subfertile couples who presented for semen analysis to the Massachusetts General Hospital .	
17003688-4	Semen parameters were dichotomized based on World Health Organization reference values for sperm concentration ( &lt;20 million/mL ) and motility ( &lt;50% motile ) and the Tygerberg Kruger Strict criteria for morphology ( &lt;4% normal ) .	1 11 112
17003688-5	The comparison group was men with all 3 semen parameters above the reference values .	
17003688-6	In a single spot urine sample from each man , phthalate metabolites were measured using solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry .	1 12 127
17003688-7	RESULTS There were dose-response relationships of MBP with low sperm concentration ( odds ratio per quartile adjusted for age , abstinence time , and smoking status = 1.00 , 3.1 , 2.5 , 3.3 ; P for trend = 0.04 ) and motility ( 1.0 , 1.5 , 1.5 , 1.8 ; P for trend = 0.04 ) .	
17003688-8	There was suggestive evidence of an association between the highest MBzP quartile and low sperm concentration ( 1.00 , 1.1 , 1.1 , 1.9 ; P for trend = 0.13 ) .	
17003688-9	There were no relationships of monoethyl phthalate , monomethyl phthalate , and the DEHP metabolites with these semen parameters .	
17003688-10	CONCLUSION The present study confirms previous results on the relationship of altered semen quality with exposure to MBP at general population levels .	
17003688-11	We did not find associations between semen parameters and 3 DEHP metabolites .	
21524981-0	CONTEXT Most of the U.S. population is exposed to the high-production-volume chemical bisphenol A ( BPA ) , but targetable sources of exposure remain to be determined .	
21524981-1	Animal studies and one human study suggest that BPA is a neurotoxicant .	
21524981-2	CASE PRESENTATION A mother in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment ( HOME ) Study , a prospective birth cohort examining prenatal and postnatal environmental toxicants and childhood health outcomes , had a urinary BPA concentration of 583 Âµg/g creatinine at 27 weeks of pregnancy , which was the highest concentration observed in this cohort ( median , 2.0 Âµg/g creatinine ) and the general population .	1 12 127
21524981-3	We used prenatal questionnaire data and a follow-up interview to identify potential sources of exposure that included daily plastic use and consumption of canned beverages and foods .	24 244 2 243
21524981-4	Her male infant had a normal newborn neurobehavioral assessment but presented with abnormalities at the 1-month examination that prompted physician referral .	1 11 112
21524981-5	Subsequently , the child had normal neurobehavioral testing results at annual evaluations from 1 to 5 years of age .	
21524981-6	DISCUSSION Investigations into sources of high gestational urinary BPA concentrations provide an opportunity to identify potential targets for reduction of BPA exposure .	1 12 127
21524981-7	This case highlights a potential link between gestational BPA exposure and transient neurobehavioral changes that is hypothesis generating and can serve to alert researchers to potential areas for examination in future studies .	1 11 112
21524981-8	RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE It is important to educate health care practitioners regarding potential sources of BPA exposure and anticipatory guidance on minimization of exposures during vulnerable periods of development .	
19418718-0	As the concentration of methylmercury ( MeHg ) in the environment is insignificant , hair can be used as a suitable matrix to estimate endogenous MeHg exposure .	1 123 12
19418718-1	Avalidated analytical method with AMA 254 spectrometer was used for the determination of inorganic mercury and methylmercury species in the hair of dentists , workers in fish industry and professionally non-exposed adults .	1 123 12
19418718-2	ANOVA and QC Expert software was used for statistical evaluation .	
19418718-3	The number of amalgam fillings in oral cavity , consumption of fish , gender , smoking habits and age of the subjects were taken into account .	24 244 2 243
19418718-4	A significantly higher level of inorganic bound mercury ( Hg(in) ) was found in the hair of dentists .	24 12 1 244 123 243 2
19418718-5	The number of amalgam fillings had a slightly significant effect on Hg(in) ; fish consumption had a significant influence on MeHg and slightly also on Hg(in) .	24 244 2 243
19418718-6	Other parameters were not significant .	
17006435-0	While fine mode particulate matter ( PM(2.5) ) forms the basis for regulating particles in the US and other countries , there is a serious paucity of large population-based studies of its acute effect on mortality .	
17006435-1	To address this issue , we examined the association between PM(2.5) and both all-cause and specific-cause mortality using over 1.3 million deaths in 27 US communities between 1997 and 2002 .	
17006435-2	A two-stage approach was used .	
17006435-3	First , the association between PM(2.5) and mortality in each community was quantified using a case-crossover design .	2 231 23
17006435-4	Second , meta-analysis was used to estimate a summary effect over all 27 communities .	
17006435-5	Effect modification of age and gender was examined using interaction terms in the case-crossover model , while effect modification of community-specific characteristics including geographic location , annual PM(2.5) concentration above 15 microg/m(3) and central air conditioning prevalence was examined using meta-regression .	2 231 23
17006435-6	We observed a 1.21% ( 95% CI 0.29 , 2.14% ) increase in all-cause mortality , a 1.78% ( 95% CI 0.20 , 3.36% ) increase in respiratory related mortality and a 1.03% ( 95% CI 0.02 , 2.04% ) increase in stroke related mortality with a 10 microg/m(3) increase in previous day's PM(2.5) .	2 231 23
17006435-7	The magnitude of these associations is more than triple that recently reported for PM(10) , suggesting that combustion and traffic related particles are more toxic than larger sized particles .	
17006435-8	Effect modification occurred in all-cause and specific-cause deaths with greater effects in subjects &gt;or=75 years of age .	
17006435-9	There was suggestive evidence that women may be more susceptible to PM(2.5) effects than men , and that effects were larger in the East than in the West .	
17006435-10	Increased prevalence of central air conditioning was associated with a decreased effect of PM(2.5) .	
17006435-11	Our findings describe the magnitude of the effect on all-cause and specific-cause mortality , the modifiers of this association , and suggest that PM(2.5) may pose a public health risk even at or below current ambient levels .	
19418821-0	For this paper , we considered relationships between mortality , vehicular traffic density , and ambient levels of 12 hazardous air pollutants , elemental carbon ( EC ) , oxides of nitrogen ( NOx ) , sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) , and sulfate ( SO4(2-) ) .	
19418821-1	These pollutant species were selected as markers for specific types of emission sources , including vehicular traffic , coal combustion , smelters , and metal-working industries .	
19418821-2	Pollutant exposures were estimated using emissions inventories and atmospheric dispersion models .	2 23
19418821-3	We analyzed associations between county ambient levels of these pollutants and survival patterns among approximately 70,000 U.S. male veterans by mortality period ( 1976-2001 and subsets ) , type of exposure model , and traffic density level .	2 231 23
19418821-4	We found significant associations between all-cause mortality and traffic-related air quality indicators and with traffic density per se , with stronger associations for benzene , formaldehyde , diesel particulate , NOx , and EC .	
19418821-5	The maximum effect on mortality for all cohort subjects during the 26-yr follow-up period is approximately 10% , but most of the pollution-related deaths in this cohort occurred in the higher-traffic counties , where excess risks approach 20% .	
19418821-6	However , mortality associations with diesel particulates are similar in high- and low-traffic counties .	
19418821-7	Sensitivity analyses show risks decreasing slightly over time and minor differences between linear and logarithmic exposure models .	
19418821-8	Two-pollutant models show stronger risks associated with specific traffic-related pollutants than with traffic density per se , although traffic density retains statistical significance in most cases .	
19418821-9	We conclude that tailpipe emissions of both gases and particles are among the most significant and robust predictors of mortality in this cohort and that most of those associations have weakened over time .	
19418821-10	However , we have not evaluated possible contributions from road dust or traffic noise .	
19418821-11	Stratification by traffic density level suggests the presence of response thresholds , especially for gaseous pollutants .	
19418821-12	Because of their wider distributions of estimated exposures , risk estimates based on emissions and atmospheric dispersion models tend to be more precise than those based on local ambient measurements .	
19419743-0	INTRODUCTION The property of mercury to amalgamate with other metals is used to create a material for filling teeth .	
19419743-1	This material remains the cheapest and most efficient in tooth restoration .	
19419743-2	Mercurial toxicity has been documented since Antiquity but the metal remains widely used in some countries .	
19419743-3	This study compared mercury impregnation in dentists and dental assistants in Monastir ( Tunisia ) to another population not exposed professionally .	
19419743-4	SUBJECTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was made on 52 dentists and dental assistants working in private offices and in the stomatology unit of the Monastir teaching hospital , with a control group of 52 physicians and nurses working in the Monastir Fattouma Bourguiba hospital .	24 12 1 244 2 125 127
19419743-5	The groups were paired according to age and gender .	
19419743-6	The study lasted three months .	
19419743-7	A questionnaire investigated the socioprofessional features of the study population , non professional mercury exposure , work environment , the various amalgam handling and preparation techniques , and preventive hygiene measures .	
19419743-8	Urinary and salivary sampling was performed so as to prevent any accidental mercurial contamination .	1 12 125 127
19419743-9	Mercury level was assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy in an automatic sampler , urine creatinine with JaffÃ©'s colorimetric reaction .	
19419743-10	The results of mercury level assessment were expressed in microg/g of creatinine , salivary mercury in mug/l .	1 12 125
19419743-11	The statistical analysis was made with the Epi.info 6 software .	
19419743-12	Khi(2) and Fisher tests were used to compare qualitative variables .	
19419743-13	The ANOVA test was used to compare averages with a statistic significance threshold at 0.05 .	
19419743-14	RESULTS Sixty-one percent of individuals with risk exposure worked in a dental clinic .	
19419743-15	Bruxism and onychophagia were more important in the control group with a significant statistical difference ( respectively , p=0.01 and p&lt;0.0001 ) .	
19419743-16	The urinary and salivary mercury levels were significantly increased in the exposed group , with respective values of 20.4+/-42.4microg/g of creatinine and 10.6+/-13.02microg/l versus 0.04+/-0.3microg/g of creatinine and 0microg/l in the control group .	1 12 125 127
19419743-17	Disposing of amalgam waste was inadequate in 94% of the cases .	
19419743-18	The variation of mercury in urine was significantly influenced by the presence of fabric curtains ( p=0.04 ) .	24 12 1 244 2 127
19419743-19	Eating lunch at meals at the work place was also linked to a significant increase of mercury levels in urine ( p=0.04 ) .	24 12 1 2 243 127
19419743-20	The storage mode of mercury in open containers was a significant factor for variation of mercury level ( p=0.03 ) .	
19419743-21	DISCUSSION Most dentists ' private offices in Monastir do not comply or comply weakly with prevention measures linked to risk of mercury poisoning .	
19419743-22	Awareness campaigns were launched as well as actions for the improvement of work conditions : efficient aspiration of offices containing fixed sources of mercury , adequate storage of mercury and waste , and compliance to occupational hygiene rules .	
22863806-0	Mercury release after breakage of compact fluorescent lamps ( CFLs ) has recently become an issue of public health concern , especially in the case of early life infants .	
22863806-1	Preliminary , screening type calculations have indicated that there is potential for increased intake of mercury vapor by inhalation after breakage of a CFL .	
22863806-2	Several experimental and computational studies have shown that , when modeling the breakage of a CFL , the room space must be segregated into different zones , according to the potential of mercury vapor to accumulate in them after accidental release .	
22863806-3	In this study , a detailed two-zone model that captures the physicochemical processes that govern mercury vapor formation and dispersion in the indoor environment was developed .	
22863806-4	The mercury fate model was coupled to a population exposure model that accounts for age and gender-related differences in time-activity patterns , as well as country differences in body weight and age distribution .	2
22863806-5	The parameters above are used to determine the intake through inhalation ( gas phase and particles ) and non-dietary ingestion ( settled dust ) for each age , gender group and ethnicity .	24 23 2 242
22863806-6	Results showed that the critical period for intake covers the first 4h after the CFL breaks and that room air temperature significantly affects the intake rate .	
22863806-7	Indoor air concentration of mercury vapor may exceed toxicological thresholds of concern such as the acute Reference Exposure Limit ( REL ) for mercury vapor set by the Environmental Protection Agency of California .	2 232 23
22863806-8	Ingestion intake through hand-to-mouth behavior is significant for infants and toddlers , counting for about 20% of the overall intake .	24 2
22863806-9	Simple risk reduction measures including increased indoor ventilation followed by careful clean-up of the accident site , may limit dramatically the estimated health risk .	
17007906-0	Human breast milk represents the best choice for the nutrition of infants .	
17007906-1	It is often used for monitoring human exposures to environmental chemicals .	
17007906-2	Uniquely suited to meet human biological needs , breast milk composition , especially fat content , changes significantly with time from delivery .	
17007906-3	With the aim to compare the concentration of organochlorine compounds ( OCs ) in colostrum versus mature milk , we obtained samples of fourth-fifth day postpartum milk ( colostrum ) and day-14 postpartum milk ( mature milk ) from 12 women enrolled in the project " Early Childhood Development and PCB Exposure in Slovakia " .	1 12 124
17007906-4	The concentrations of selected organochlorine pesticides and congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) were measured using gas chromatography with electron capture detection and reported on lipid adjusted basis .	
17007906-5	No significant differences were found between organochlorine levels in colostrum and those in mature milk samples .	1 12 124
17007906-6	A very close correlation was found between the concentrations of organochlorine compounds in colostrum and mature milk ( Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.94-0.98 for PCBs , and r=0.85-0.99 for organochlorine pesticides , p&lt;0.001 for all compounds ) .	1 12 124
17007906-7	The present study concludes that the use of colostrum samples provides a close estimate of the child's exposure to OCs in the early neonatal period and demonstrates that , despite the lower fat content , colostrum specimens are adequate to conduct OC analyses .	
17007908-0	The bactericide triclosan is commonly used in e.g. plastics , textiles and health care products .	
17007908-1	In vitro studies on rat and human biological systems indicate that triclosan might exert adverse effects in humans .	
17007908-2	Triclosan has previously been found in human plasma and milk , but neither the primary source of human exposure nor the efficiency of triclosan transfer to human milk is known .	
17007908-3	In this study , plasma and milk were sampled from 36 mothers and analyzed for triclosan .	1 122 12 124
17007908-4	Scrutinization of the women's personal care products revealed that nine of the mothers used toothpaste , deodorant or soap containing triclosan .	24 244 2 22
17007908-5	Triclosan and/or its metabolites were omnipresent in the analyzed plasma and milk .	
17007908-6	The concentrations were higher in both plasma and milk from the mothers who used personal care products containing triclosan than in the mothers who did not .	24 244 2 22
17007908-7	This demonstrated that personal care products containing triclosan were the dominant , but not the only , source of systemic exposure to triclosan .	
17007908-8	The concentrations were significantly higher in plasma than in milk , indicating that infant exposure to triclosan via breast milk is much less than the dose in the mother .	
19447850-0	OBJECTIVES The main objective of the study was to gather information about the current controls and levels of exposure to 4,4'-methylene-bis ( 2-chloroaniline ) ( MbOCA ) in a representative cross section of workplaces that use it to manufacture polyurethane elastomers .	
19447850-1	The study also aimed to investigate whether controls and guidance could be improved and to investigate exposure to isocyanates in these workplaces using biological monitoring .	
19447850-2	METHODS An occupational hygienist and a field scientist visited the two UK suppliers and 20 out of the 25 workplaces known to be using MbOCA in the UK during 2005 and 2006 .	24 2 242
19447850-3	They collected air samples , surface wipes , gloves , and urine samples and made observations to assess exposure and the adequacy of controls .	24 12 23 242 1 2 127
19447850-4	All samples were analysed for MbOCA and urine samples were additionally analysed for isocyanate metabolites .	1 12 127
19447850-5	A statistical analysis was made of the results .	
19447850-6	RESULTS Only 2.5% of the 80 personal inhalation exposures to MbOCA exceeded the workplace exposure limit of 5 microg m(-3) 8-h time-weighted average and 84% were below the limit of detection ( LOD ) .	23 2 233
19447850-7	Surface samples ( n = 334 ) were collected from MbOCA users and suppliers and 60% had detectable levels of MbOCA ranging from 0.019 to 400 microg cm(-2) .	24 2 242
19447850-8	The highest levels were around a hopper , ovens , and the weighing and pouring areas .	
19447850-9	MbOCA was also detected in 8 of the 75 samples collected from areas not likely to be in contact with MbOCA .	
19447850-10	At the two suppliers , samples ( n = 28 ) were collected from the outside surfaces of recently imported kegs , pallets , and the floor around kegs .	
19447850-11	Six samples had detectable levels and four of these ( 0.2 , 0.8 , 1 , and 6 microg cm(-2) ) were from the floor and pallets in both suppliers .	
19447850-12	The other two positive results were found on the outside rim ( 18 microg cm(-2) ) and side ( 23 microg cm(-2) ) of a keg at one supplier indicating contamination by the manufacturer .	
19447850-13	Urine samples ( n = 79 ) were collected and 49% were below the LOD for MbOCA and only three samples had levels of MbOCA that exceeded the biological monitoring guidance value ( BMGV ) of 15 micromol mol(-1) creatinine .	1 12 127
19447850-14	The highest urinary MbOCA concentrations were in samples from workers casting and moulding .	1 12 127
19447850-15	The 90th percentile of the urine MbOCA results was 8.6 micromol MbOCA per mol creatinine .	
19447850-16	Urine samples were also analysed for the diamine metabolites of toluene diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate and 33% had detectable levels with 22 and 13% of results , respectively , above the BMGV for isocyanates ( 1 micromol isocyanate-derived diamine per mol creatinine ) .	1 12 127
19447850-17	The maximum urinary concentration of toluene diamine and hexane diamine were 15.6 and 10.1 micromol mol(-1) creatinine , respectively .	1 12 127
19447850-18	CONCLUSIONS The survey found that the measures used to control exposure to MbOCA could be improved .	
19447850-19	Although air levels of MbOCA were generally low , there was evidence of spread of surface contamination and poor maintenance of controls such as local exhaust ventilation .	
19447850-20	A BMGV based on the 90th percentile of data from workplaces with good control would be less than the 90% value of 8.6 micromol mol(-1) creatinine found in this study and suggests that the current BMGV of 15 micromol mol(-1) creatinine is no longer acting as a stimulus to reduce exposure .	
19447850-21	The metabolites of isocyanates found in urine samples in this study could arise from inhalation exposure to isocyanates or from dermal exposure to either isocyanates or their diamine breakdown product and need further investigation .	1 12 127
19466477-0	Arsenic ( As ) is a known human carcinogen and widely distributed in the environment .	
19466477-1	The main route of As exposure in the general population is through food and drinking water .	
19466477-2	Seafood harvested in Korea contains high-level organoarsenics such as arsenobetaine , arsenocholine , and arsenosugars , which are much less harmful than inorganic arsenics .	
19466477-3	However , for those who eat large amounts of seafood it is important to understand whether seafood consumption affects urinary levels of inorganic As metabolites such as arsenite , arsenate , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) .	1 12 127
19466477-4	In this study we investigated urinary As metabolites ( inorganic As , MMA[V] , DMA[V] ) and some biological indexes such as AST , GSH , GPX , lipid peroxidation , and uric acid in volunteer study subjects ( seven males and nine females ) .	11 12 1 11121 11122 1112 111 1114 127
19466477-5	Total urinary As metabolites were analyzed by the hydride generation method , followed by arsenic speciation using HPLC with ICP-mass spectrometry .	1 12 127
19466477-6	Study subjects refrained from eating seafood for 3 days prior to the first urine collection and then ingested seafood daily for 6 consecutive days .	24 12 1 2 243 127
19466477-7	The first voided urine of the morning was collected from each subject the first day of the consecutive 6 days of seafood ingestion but prior to the first seafood meal .	24 12 1 2 243 127
19466477-8	The first voided urine of the morning was also collected on days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , and 14 after seafood ingestion .	24 12 1 2 243 127
19466477-9	The daily mean intake of total As was 6.98 mg , comprised of 4.71 mg of seaweed ( 67% ) , 1.74 mg of flat fish ( 25% ) , and 0.53 mg of conch ( 8% ) .	24 2 243
19466477-10	We observed a substantial increase in total urinary As metabolites for subjects consuming seafood from day 1 , which recovered to control level at day 10 .	24 12 1 2 243 127
19466477-11	The increase in total urinary As metabolites was attributed to the increase in DMA , which is a more harmful metabolite than organoarsenics .	1 12 127
19466477-12	However , no significant changes in response biological indexes were observed .	
19466477-13	These results suggest that it is necessary to evaluate As metabolism when assessing the exposure to inorganic As and potential chronic health effects of seafood consumption in Korea .	
17023022-0	The aim of our study was to obtain the data on the exposure of breast-fed infants to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and selected organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) in the Wielkopolska province ( Poland ) .	
17023022-1	The levels of indicator PCBs , and selected OCPs , including two DDT metabolites ( HCB , p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDD , p,p'-DDE and alpha,beta,gamma-HCH ) were determined in 27 human milk samples , collected in 2000-2001 , according to WHO protocol .	1 12 124
17023022-2	Estimated daily intakes ( EDIs ) of all analytes were calculated .	2
17023022-3	Our results were compared with those obtained by an analysis of human milk samples from other European and non-European countries , collected in the same period time .	
17023022-4	We have stated that median exposure of Wielkopolska first breast-fed infants to OCPs is comparable ( EDI(HCB) = 0.086 microg/kgbw/day ; EDI(beta-HCH)=0.063 microg/kgbw/day ) or higher ( EDI(p,p'-DDE) = 3.495 microg/kgbw/day ) than in other European countries , while exposure to PCBs ( EDI(Sigma7PCB) = 0.364 microg/kgbw/day ) is situated at the low end of the intake of these xenobiotics by breast-fed infants from different regions of Europe .	24 2 243
21498147-0	BACKGROUND Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDE ) , which are used as flame retardants , have been found to be higher in residents of California than of other parts of the United States .	
21498147-1	OBJECTIVES We aimed to investigate the role of immigration to California on PBDE levels in Latino children .	
21498147-2	METHODS We compared serum PBDE concentrations in a population of first-generation Mexican-American 7-year-old children ( n = 264 ) , who were born and raised in California [ Center for Health Analysis of Mothers and Children of Salinas ( CHAMACOS ) study ] , with 5-year-old Mexican children ( n = 283 ) , who were raised in the states in Mexico where most CHAMACOS mothers had originated ( Proyecto Mariposa ) .	1 122 12
21498147-3	RESULTS On average , PBDE serum concentrations in the California Mexican-American children were three times higher than their mothers ' levels during pregnancy and seven times higher than concentrations in the children living in Mexico .	1 122 12
21498147-4	The PBDE serum concentrations were higher in the Mexican-American children regardless of length of time their mother had resided in California or the duration of the child's breast-feeding .	1 122 12
21498147-5	These data suggest that PBDE serum concentrations in these children resulted primarily from postnatal exposure .	1 122 12
21498147-6	CONCLUSIONS Latino children living in California have much higher PBDE serum levels than their Mexican counterparts .	1 122 12
21498147-7	Given the growing evidence documenting potential health effects of PBDE exposure , the levels in young children noted in this study potentially present a major public health challenge , especially in California .	
21498147-8	In addition , as PBDEs are being phased out and replaced by other flame retardants , the health consequences of these chemical replacements should be investigated and weighed against their purported fire safety benefits .	
19506431-0	OBJECTIVE We evaluated the association between infant hair-Hg and Gesell schedules ( GS ) .	11 1 123 12 112
19506431-1	BACKGROUND Longitudinal assessment of prenatal and postnatal Hg exposure during the first 60 months .	
19506431-2	METHODS We used hair-Hg as a marker of postnatal Hg exposure ( inorganic and methyl-Hg from breast milk , and ethyl-Hg from thimerosal ) and GS measured at 6 , 36 , and 60 months .	1 123 12
19506431-3	RESULTS Hair-Hg at 6 months responded to events related to Hg exposure and breastfeeding .	
19506431-4	However , most neurodevelopment delays observed at 6 months were overcome with infant growth ; at 60 months 87% of children showed adequate GS ( &gt;85 ) .	1 11 112
19506431-5	Length of lactation and hair-Hg were each significantly correlated with GS , but in opposite ways : length of lactation was positive and significantly correlated with all GS at 60 months ; hair-Hg concentrations were negative and significantly correlated with GS at 6 months ( r=-0.333 ; P=0.002 ) and 60 months ( r=-0.803 ; P=0.010 ) , but not at 36 months .	1 123 12
19506431-6	Multiple regression models showed that the GS outcome at 60 months depended on GS at 36 months that in turn was influenced by infants ' developmental and Hg exposure variables .	
19506431-7	GS at 6 months was significantly influenced by prenatal ( maternal and infant hair-Hg at birth ) and postnatal Hg exposure at 6 months .	1 123 12
19506431-8	CONCLUSIONS Until there is more refined approach to recognize children sensitive to Hg exposure , and in situations of uncertainty ( EtHg exposure ) , the neurodevelopment benefit of breastfeeding should be recommended .	
17029826-0	Exposure to arsenic through domestic burning arsenic-containing coal causes various tumors in a population of Guizhou , China .	
17029826-1	The glycophorin A ( GPA ) assay is a human mutation assay detecting somatic variation in erythrocytes expressing the MN blood type , and was used to assess genotoxicity of arsenic-exposed patients .	1111 1 111 11
17029826-2	Peripheral blood was collected from 18 adult healthy subjects and 40 arsenic-exposed patients in heparin-treated tubes .	1 122 12
17029826-3	Erythrocytes were isolated , fixed in formalin and immuno-labeled with fluorescent antibodies against GPA , followed by flow cytometry analysis .	
17029826-4	Arsenic exposure increased the variant frequency ( expressed as the number of variant red cells per 10(6) erythrocytes ) : NN , 3.7 in healthy subjects versus 21.2 in arsenic-exposed patients ; N phi , 12.6 versus 33.1 ; MM , 13.1 versus 110 ; and M phi , 5.2 versus 20.3 .	
17029826-5	The total GPA variant frequency was increased about five-fold ( 34.7 in healthy subjects versus 185 in arsenosis patients ) .	
17029826-6	Furthermore , the variant frequency was significantly higher in skin tumor-bearing patients : NN , 19.4 in arsenic-exposed non-tumor patients versus 31.5 in tumor-bearing patients ; N phi , 29.5 versus 54.5 ; MM , 102 versus 159 ; M phi , 15.9 versus 45.1 .	
17029826-7	Total GPA variant frequency in arsenic-exposed patients bearing skin tumors was significantly increased compared to patients without skin tumors ( 167 versus 290 ) .	
17029826-8	The relationship between arsenic exposure history and GPA variant frequency was less evident .	
17029826-9	These data demonstrate that arsenic exposure is associated with mutations at the GPA locus , an effect exaggerated in patients bearing arsenic-induced skin tumors .	
17029826-10	The variant frequency of GPA could be a useful biomarker for arsenic exposure and arsenic carcinogenesis .	
19538983-0	Exposure to naturally occurring inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) , primarily from contaminated drinking water , is considered one of the top environmental health threats worldwide .	
19538983-1	Arsenic ( +3 oxidation state ) methyltransferase ( AS3MT ) is the key enzyme in the biotransformation pathway of iAs .	
19538983-2	AS3MT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to trivalent arsenicals , resulting in the production of methylated ( MAs ) and dimethylated arsenicals ( DMAs ) .	
19538983-3	MAs is a susceptibility factor for iAs-induced toxicity .	
19538983-4	In this study , we evaluated the association of the polymorphism in AS3MT gene with iAs metabolism and with the presence of arsenic ( As ) premalignant skin lesions .	1 11 112
19538983-5	This is a case-control study of 71 cases with skin lesions and 51 controls without skin lesions recruited from a iAs endemic area in Mexico .	
19538983-6	We measured urinary As metabolites , differentiating the trivalent and pentavalent arsenical species , using the hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry .	1 12 127
19538983-7	In addition , the study subjects were genotyped to analyze three single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , A-477G , T14458C ( nonsynonymus SNP ; Met287Thr ) , and T35587C , in the AS3MT gene .	
19538983-8	We compared the frequencies of the AS3MT alleles , genotypes , and haplotypes in individuals with and without skin lesions .	
19538983-9	Marginal differences in the frequencies of the Met287Thr genotype were identified between individuals with and without premalignant skin lesions ( p=0.055 ) : individuals carrying the C ( TC+CC ) allele ( Thr ) were at risk [ odds ratio=4.28 ; 95% confidence interval ( 1.0-18.5) ] .	
19538983-10	Also , individuals with C allele of Met287Thr displayed greater percentage of MAs in urine and decrease in the percentage of DMAs .	1 12 127
19538983-11	These findings indicate that Met287Thr influences the susceptibility to premalignant As skin lesions and might be at increased risk for other adverse health effects of iAs exposure .	
22732214-0	Within-house and within-room spatial temporal variability in PBDE contamination of indoor dust may influence substantially the reliability of human exposure assessments based on single point samples , but have hitherto been little studied .	
22732214-1	This paper reports concentrations of PBDEs 17 , 28 , 47 , 49 , 66 , 85 , 99 , 100 , 153 , and 154 in indoor dust samples ( n=112 ) from two houses in Birmingham , UK .	24 2 242
22732214-2	To evaluate within-house spatial variability , four separate rooms were sampled in house 1 and two separate rooms sampled in house 2 .	
22732214-3	Up to four different 1 mÂ² areas in the same room were sampled to evaluate within-room spatial variability , and for all studied areas , samples were taken for eight consecutive months to evaluate temporal and seasonal variability .	
22732214-4	Concentrations of Î£PBDEs in individual samples from house 1 varied between 21 and 280 ng gâ»Â¹ ; while the range of concentrations in house 2 was 20-1000 ng gâ»Â¹ .	
22732214-5	This indicates that where and when a sample is taken in a house can influence substantially the contamination detected .	
22732214-6	In one room , concentrations of PBDEs in an area located close to putative PBDE sources exceeded substantially those in an area 2m away , with marked differences also observed between two areas in another room .	
22732214-7	Substantial within-room spatial differences in PBDE concentrations were not discernible in the other rooms studied .	
22732214-8	Concentrations of PBDEs in the majority of rooms within the same houses were not markedly different between rooms .	
22732214-9	Nevertheless , large differences were observed between PBDE concentrations detected in two rooms in the same house in both houses studied .	
22732214-10	In one instance , this is hypothesised to be attributable to the presence of a carpet in one room and bare wooden floor in another , but firm conclusions cannot be drawn .	
22732214-11	Within-room temporal ( month-to-month ) variability was substantial ( relative standard deviations for Î£PBDEs=15-200% ) .	
22732214-12	In some rooms , the introduction and removal of putative sources like a TV and a bed , appeared to exert a discernible influence on PBDE concentrations .	
22732214-13	PBDE concentrations in spring and summer were not markedly different from those observed in autumn and winter .	
22732214-14	Possible dilution of PBDE concentrations in dust at higher dust loadings ( g dust per mÂ² floor surface ) was investigated in a small number of rooms , but no firm evidence of such dilution was evident .	
17054012-0	Campo de Jales is a village surrounding the abandoned Jales mine .	
17054012-1	The area is heavily contaminated with heavy metals and dusts from large tailings piles as result of centuries of mining operations .	
17054012-2	The aim of this study is to investigate potential health threats associated with site contamination .	
17054012-3	The population studied comprised two groups : people living in Campo de Jales ( n = 229 ) and a control group - people living in Vilar de Macada ( n = 234 ) .	
17054012-4	Lead and cadmium exposure and symptoms survey were carried out .	
17054012-5	The results showed a significant higher levels of blood lead and cadmium between the Campo de Jales residents ( lead : 9.5 microgr/dl versus 7.7 microgr/dl ; cadmium : 0.84 microgr/dl versus 0,65 microgr/dl ) as well as to a higher prevalence of respiratory and irritation symptoms and great concern about his own health .	1 122 12
17054012-6	In conclusion : community is the scene of long-term health problems resulting from the site environmental contamination .	
19602502-0	When working with hot mix asphalt , road pavers are exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) through the inhalation of vapors and particulate matter ( PM ) and through dermal contact with PM and contaminated surfaces .	
19602502-1	Several PAHs with four to six rings are potent carcinogens which reside in these particulate emissions .	
19602502-2	Since urinary biomarkers of large PAHs are rarely detectable in asphalt workers , attention has focused upon urinary levels of the more volatile and abundant two-ring and three-ring PAHs as potential biomarkers of PAH exposure .	
19602502-3	Here , we compare levels of particulate polycyclic aromatic compounds ( P-PACs , a group of aromatic hydrocarbons containing PAHs and heterocyclic compounds with four or more rings ) in air and dermal patch samples from 20 road pavers to the corresponding urinary levels of naphthalene ( U-Nap ) ( two rings ) , phenanthrene ( U-Phe ) ( three rings ) , monohydroxylated metabolites of naphthalene ( OH-Nap ) and phenanthrene ( OH-Phe ) , and 1-hydroxypyrene ( OH-Pyr ) ( four rings ) , the most widely used biomarker of PAH exposure .	1 2 12 22 127
19602502-4	For each worker , daily breathing-zone air ( n = 55 ) and dermal patch samples ( n = 56 ) were collected on three consecutive workdays along with postshift , bedtime , and morning urine samples ( n = 149 ) .	12 22 23 1 2 127 233
19602502-5	Measured levels of P-PACs and the urinary analytes were used to statistically model exposure-biomarker relationships while controlling for urinary creatinine , smoking status , age , body mass index , and the timing of urine sampling .	1 12 127
19602502-6	Levels of OH-Phe in urine collected postshift , at bedtime , and the following morning were all significantly associated with levels of P-PACs in air and dermal patch samples .	12 22 23 1 2 127
19602502-7	For U-Nap , U-Phe , and OH-Pyr , both air and dermal patch measurements of P-PACs were significant predictors of postshift urine levels , and dermal patch measurements were significant predictors of bedtime urine levels ( all three analytes ) and morning urine levels ( U-Nap and OH-Pyr only ) .	1 2 12 22 127
19602502-8	Significant effects of creatinine concentration were observed for all analytes , and modest effects of smoking status and body mass index were observed for U-Phe and OH-Pyr , respectively .	
19602502-9	Levels of OH-Nap were not associated with P-PAC measurements in air or dermal patch samples but were significantly affected by smoking status , age , day of sample collection , and urinary creatinine .	
19602502-10	We conclude that U-Nap , U-Phe , OH-Phe , and OH-Pyr can be used as biomarkers of exposure to particulate asphalt emissions , with OH-Phe being the most promising candidate .	1 12
19602502-11	Indications that levels of U-Nap , U-Phe , and OH-Pyr were significantly associated with dermal patch measurements well into the evening after a given work shift , combined with the small ratios of within-person variance components to between-person variance components at bedtime , suggest that bedtime measurements may be useful for investigating dermal PAH exposures .	
17055057-0	Concerns about the carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting characteristics of organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) have led to a global ban on OCP use .	
17055057-1	However , OCPs persist in the environment for decades because of their long half-life .	
17055057-2	We evaluated serum levels of OCPs and their correlations with usual dietary intake and other lifestyle factors among 250 healthy women who participated as controls in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study .	24 12 1 122 2 243
17055057-3	Serum levels of hexachlorocyclohexane isomers ( alpha-HCH , beta-HCH , gamma-HCH ) , dichloro-di-phenyl-trichloroethane ( DDT ) isomers ( p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , trans-nonachlor ( TNC ) , and eight polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB ) congeners ( IUPAC no. 74 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 170 , 180 , 183 , and 187 ) were measured .	
17055057-4	Lifestyle factors and usual dietary habits over the past 5 years were assessed through an in-person interview .	24 2 243
17055057-5	With the exception of PCB , total OCP levels in our study population were significantly higher than those observed in other countries .	
17055057-6	Age , income , body mass index , waist-to-hip ratio , number of pregnancies , and/or total duration of breastfeeding were all significantly correlated with all types of OCPs .	
17055057-7	Of the 20 food groups evaluated , correlations with serum total OCPs were observed for eggs ( r=0.13 ) , fresh beans ( r=-0.17 ) , tea ( r=0.14 ) , and animal fat ( r=0.18 ) .	24 2 243
17055057-8	Multiple regression analyses showed that age and animal fat intake were positively associated with serum total level OCPs , while leafy vegetable and fresh bean consumption was negatively associated with OCPs level .	24 2 243
17055057-9	Our study suggests that dietary intake may be an important contributor of serum levels of OCPs in Chinese women .	
17056211-0	An integrated approach based on ambient and biological monitoring , the latter including both biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility , was applied to characterize benzene exposure in a group of 37 taxi drivers of the city of Parma ( Italy ) .	12 23 1 2 127 232
17056211-1	Airborne benzene concentrations were assessed by 24 h personal sampling and work-shift sampling inside the taxicab using passive samplers ( Radiello ) .	2 233 232 23
17056211-2	Benzene metabolites , trans,trans-muconic acid ( t,t-MA ) and S-phenylmercapturic acid ( S-PMA ) , and urinary cotinine as biomarker of smoking habits were measured by isotopic dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in both pre-shift ( PS ) and end-of-shift ( EOS ) samples .	1 12 127
17056211-3	Urinary benzene ( U-B ) levels were determined by solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in EOS samples .	1 12 127
17056211-4	Relevant polymorphisms of microsomal epoxide hydrolase , NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase , glutathione S-transferases M1-1 ( GSTM1 ) , T1-1 , and A1 were characterized by PCR-based methods .	
17056211-5	Mean airborne benzene concentration was 5.85 +/- 1.65 microg/m3 , as assessed by 24 h personal sampling integrating for work-shift , indoor or general environment activities .	23 2 233
17056211-6	Significantly , higher benzene concentrations were detected in the taxicab during the work-shift ( 7.71 +/- 1.95 microg/m3 , p &lt ; 0.005 ) .	2 232 23
17056211-7	Smokers eliminated significantly higher concentrations of U-B and S-PMA than non-smokers in EOS samples [ geometric mean ( geometric S.D. ) : 2.58 ( 4.23 ) versus 0.44 ( 1.79 ) microg/l for U-B ; 3.79 ( 1.50 ) versus 2.14 ( 1.87 ) microg/gcreat. for S-PMA , p &lt ; 0.002 ] .	2 232 23
17056211-8	Within smokers , S-PMA concentrations significantly increased at the end of the work-shift compared to pre-shift values ( p &lt ; 0.05). t,t-MA showed a similar behaviour , although differences were not significant .	
17056211-9	In the narrow range examined , no correlation was observed between air benzene concentration and urinary biomarkers .	1 12 127
17056211-10	All benzene biomarkers but EOS t,t-MA were correlated with U-cotinine ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
17056211-11	GSTM1 polymorphism significantly modulated S-PMA excretion , as subjects bearing the GSTM1pos genotype [ 3.61 ( 1.15 ) microg/gcreat. ] excreted significantly higher S-PMA concentrations than GSTM1null subjects [ 2.19 ( 1.18 ) microg/gcreat. , p &lt ; 0.05 ] .	
21458859-0	The levels of 21 PBDE congeners were detemined in the dust sampled from 66 personal automobiles .	24 2 242
21458859-1	The dominant congener in automobile dust was BDE-209 with a median level of 8.12 Î¼g gâ»Â¹ .	
21458859-2	Personal vehicle dust samples contained the characteristic profile of the PBDE congeners that comprise the PentaBDE and DecaBDE commercial formulations .	24 2 242
21458859-3	Levels of PBDEs in personal automobiles are generally reduced in comparison to our previously reported levels in resale vehicles on dealership lots presumably due to a dilution effect introduced by dust or debris that does not originate from the vehicle .	
21458859-4	Laboratory photochemical studies were conducted on both automobile dust collected from personal vehicles as well as BDE-209 adsorbed to sodium sulfate .	24 2 242
21458859-5	No significant degradation occurred in the personal vehicle dust after 56 days of constant UVA irradiation while significant degradation did occur with BDE-209 adsorbed to sodium sulfate .	
21458859-6	PBDEs from the degradation of BDE-209 were identified and potential degradation pathways elucidated .	
21458859-7	Human exposure potential to PBDEs from automobile dust ingestion remains a serious concern in the U.S. population .	24 2 242
22119327-0	NHANES subjects self-identified as " Asian , Pacific Islander , Native American , or multiracial " ( A/P/N/M ) have higher levels of blood organic mercury than other racial/ethnic groups ; however , the reasons for this have been unclear .	
22119327-1	This research uses exposure modeling to determine the reasons for elevated blood methylmercury ( MeHg ) levels , and also extends previous analyses of observed NHANES blood levels .	
22119327-2	The probabilistic SHEDS-Dietary model was applied , using MeHg fish residue data from FDA's Total Diet Study ( 1990-2002 ) combined with NHANES/WWEIA ( 1999-2006 ) fish consumption data , to generate exposure estimates by race/ethnicity , age group , and fish type .	24 2 243
22119327-3	Statistical analyses of blood methylmercury levels in the ( 6 times larger ) 1999-2006 NHANES data were compared against previous published results for 1999-2002 data .	
22119327-4	The A/P/N/M group has higher fish intake , modeled MeHg exposures , and blood levels than the general population and other racial/ethnic groups .	
22119327-5	Tuna , other saltwater fish , and other freshwater fish are key food types driving dietary MeHg exposure .	24 2 243
22119327-6	The 1-&lt;3 years-old A/P/N/M group has the highest mean dietary MeHg intake per body weight ( 0.06 Î¼g/kg/day ; times higher than the rest of the population ) .	24 2 243
22119327-7	Fish intake and modeled exposure predictions correlate well with NHANES blood biomarker levels .	
22119327-8	This study , using the SHEDS-Dietary model with national data , reinforces and expands upon previous observations that dietary exposure via fish consumption is an important route for methylmercury intake by the general population , and especially for racial/ethnic groups with higher fish consumption .	24 2 243
22119327-9	These probabilistic dietary modeling approaches could be applied for local populations ( e.g. , tribes ) and other chemicals and foods , if data are available .	24 2 243
24096042-0	Indoor pesticide exposure is a growing concern , particularly for pyrethroids , a commonly used class of pesticides .	
24096042-1	Pyrethroid concentrations may be especially high in homes of immigrant farm worker families , who often live in close proximity to agricultural fields and are faced with poor housing conditions , potentially causing high pest infestation and pesticide use .	
24096042-2	We investigate levels of pyrethroids in the house dust of farm worker family homes in a study of mothers and children living in Mendota , CA , within the population-based Mexican Immigration to California : Agricultural Safety and Acculturation ( MICASA ) Study .	24 2 242
24096042-3	We present pesticide use data and levels of pyrethroid pesticides in indoor dust collected in 2009 as measured by questionnaires and a GC/MS analysis of the pyrethroids cis- and trans-permethrin , cypermethrin , deltamethrin , esfenvalerate and resmethrin in single dust samples collected from 55 households .	24 244 2 242
24096042-4	Cis- and trans-permethrin had the highest detection frequencies at 67% , with median concentrations of 244 and 172ng/g dust , respectively .	
24096042-5	Cypermethrin was detected in 52% of the homes and had a median concentration of 186ng/g dust .	
24096042-6	Esfenvalerate , resmethrin and deltamethrin were detected in less than half the samples .	
24096042-7	We compared the pyrethroid concentrations found in our study to other studies looking at both rural and urban homes and daycares .	
24096042-8	Lower detection frequencies and/or lower median concentrations of cis- and trans-permethrin and cypermethrin were observed in our study as compared to those studies .	
24096042-9	However , deltamethrin , esfenvalerate and resmethrin were detected more frequently in the house dust from our study than in the other studies .	24 2 242
24096042-10	Because households whose children had higher urinary pyrethroid metabolite levels were more likely to be analyzed in this study , a positive bias in our estimates of household pyrethroid levels may be expected .	24 12 242 1 2 127
24096042-11	A positive association was observed with reported outdoor pesticide use and cypermethrin levels found in the indoor dust samples ( rs=0.28 , p=0.0450 ) .	24 244 2 242
24096042-12	There was also a positive association seen with summed pyrethroid levels in house dust and the results of a pesticide inventory conducted by field staff ( rs=0.32 , p=0.018 ) , a potentially useful predictor of pesticide exposure in farm worker family homes .	
24096042-13	Further research is warranted to fully investigate the utility of such a measure .	
22113848-0	BACKGROUND Animal studies indicate that some phthalate metabolites may harm female reproductive function .	
22113848-1	OBJECTIVES We assessed the associations between exposure to phthalate metabolites and pregnancy loss .	
22113848-2	METHODS Using a previously established cohort of couples planning their first pregnancy , we analyzed four primary and two oxidized secondary phthalate metabolites in urine samples collected on day 10 after the first day of the last menstrual period before conception occurred ( n = 128 ) and during the previous cycle ( if any , n = 111 ) .	1 12 127
22113848-3	Subclinical embryonal loss was identified by repeated measurement of urinary human chorionic gonadotropin , and information on clinical spontaneous abortions was obtained by telephone interview with the mother .	1 11 112
22113848-4	RESULTS Pregnancy loss ( n = 48 ) was increased among women with urinary concentration of monoethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP ) in the upper tertile in the conception sample compared with women in the lowest tertile [ adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.9 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.1 , 7.6 ] .	11 1 127 12 112
22113848-5	The corresponding OR for subclinical embryonal loss ( n = 32 ) was 40.7 ( 95% CI : 4.5 , 369.5 ) .	
22113848-6	CONCLUSIONS The phthalate metabolite MEHP was associated with higher occurrence of pregnancy loss .	
22113848-7	Because this is the first human study to show this association and the sample size is small , the findings need to be corroborated in independent studies .	
16242870-0	The classical way to demonstrate the efficiency of remediation is measuring the reduction of toxic compounds in the environment .	
16242870-1	Nevertheless , more important is the risk reduction in human health .	
16242870-2	To determine changing health effects , exposure and bio-effects have to be monitored at time of and during remediation .	
16242870-3	Kindergarten children from a heavily polluted industrial ( n=23 ) and a control area ( n=12 ) were investigated .	2 232 23
16242870-4	The region-specific outdoor and indoor exposure [ 27 volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) , emphasis on tri- and tetrachloroethylene ( TRI , TETRA) ] , the internal load [ (trichloroacetic acid-TCA-as urine metabolites of TRI and TETRA and S-phenyl- and S-benzylmercapturic acid ( SPMA and SBMA ) as metabolites of benzene and toluene ] , and biological effect assessment ( [ (15)N]methacetin test-a non-invasive stable isotope test to determine the unspecific liver detoxification capacity of an individual ) were measured twice a year during 2 years of remediation ( 1997/1998 ) .	11 12 23 127 1 2 112 232
16242870-5	It could be shown that in- and outdoor levels of TRI and TETRA decreased by 47% in the heavily polluted village , Greppin , while the levels remained much the same in the control village , Roitzsch .	
16242870-6	This trend was reflected in the decreasing elimination of TCA in the urine ( 41% ) by the Greppin children , with no differences in the TCA elimination in Roitzsch probands .	1 12 127
16242870-7	As the remediation efforts decreased the burden of exposure , the children's liver detoxification capacity improved as well .	
16242870-8	Combining different methods , such as exposure-effect ( external and internal loads ) and bio-effect monitoring , proved to be useful to assess remediation successes including the improvement in human health .	
24126132-0	The aim of this survey was to use scalp hair as a biomonitor to evaluate the environmental exposure to metals and metalloids of schoolchildren living around the Mt .	1 123 12
24126132-1	Etna area , and to verify whether the degree of human exposure to trace elements is subject to changes in local environmental factors .	
24126132-2	Twenty trace elements were determined in 376 samples of scalp hair from schoolboys ( 11-13 years old ) of both genders , living in ten towns located around the volcanic area of Mt .	1 12 123
24126132-3	Etna ( Sicily ) .	
24126132-4	The results were compared with those ( 215 samples ) from children living in areas of Sicily characterized by a different geological setting ( reference site ) .	
24126132-5	As , U and V showed much higher concentrations at the volcanic site whereas Sr was particularly more abundant at the reference site .	
24126132-6	Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA ) indicated an Etna factor , made up of V , U and Mn , and a second factor , concerning the reference site , characterized by Ni and Sr , and to a lesser extent by Mo and Cd .	
24126132-7	Significant differences in element concentrations were also observed among three different sectors of Mt .	
24126132-8	Etna area .	
24126132-9	Young people living in the Mt .	
24126132-10	Etna area are naturally exposed to enhanced intakes of some metals ( V , U , Mn ) and non-metals ( e.g. , As ) than individuals of the same age residing in other areas of Sicily , characterized by different lithologies and not influenced by volcanic activity .	
24126132-11	The petrographic nature of local rocks and the dispersion of the volcanic plume explain the differences , with ingestion of water and local food as the most probable exposure pathways .	
22104380-0	PURPOSE This study evaluated the arsenic methylation profile of adolescents and explored the influence of body mass index ( BMI ) on the arsenic methylation profile of adolescents in an area of Taiwan with no-obvious arsenic exposure .	
22104380-1	METHODS This study evaluated 202 normal weight students and 101 obese students from eight elementary schools , recruited from September 2009 to December 2009 .	
22104380-2	Concentrations of urinary arsenic species , including inorganic arsenic , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA(5+) ) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA(5+) ) were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry .	1 12 127
22104380-3	RESULTS Urinary total arsenic was significantly decreased with increasing BMI , indicating that obese children may retain higher levels of arsenic in the body , as compared to normal weight children .	
22104380-4	Participants with obesity accompanied by high insulin levels had higher inorganic arsenic , significantly higher MMA percentage and significantly lower DMA percentage than those with obesity and low insulin levels .	11 1 11123 111 1112
22104380-5	It seems children with obesity and high insulin levels had lower arsenic methylation capacity than those with obesity and low insulin .	
22104380-6	CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to demonstrate that total urinary arsenic is negatively associated with the BMI in adolescents in Taiwan , adjusted for age and sex .	11 1 12 112 127
22104380-7	Obese adolescents with high insulin levels had significantly higher MMA% and significantly lower DMA% than obese adolescents with low insulin .	
16242871-0	Two analytical methods ( HPLC-fluorimeter [ HPLC-FLD ] and tandem mass spectrometry LC/MS/MS ) are available to assay phenyl-hydroxyethylmercapturic acids ( PHEMAs ) , the mercapturic acids of styrene in humans .	
16242871-1	In the past , each method was used to check different populations of subjects , but until now no attempt has been made to compare the two methods .	
16242871-2	This study was designed to verify whether the two methods actually give comparable results .	
16242871-3	The influence of different conditions of sample storage in altering the concentration of PHEMAs was also investigated .	
16242871-4	Urine samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the workshift from 10 workers exposed to different levels of styrene .	1 12 127
16242871-5	Each sample was analysed both by LC/MS/MS after storage under different conditions ( respectively , at -20 and +4 degrees C , and after repeated freezing-thawing cycles ) , and by HPLC-FLD ( in the same conditions of storage ) .	
16242871-6	Strong correlations were found between the two methods both for total PHEMAs and for each of the isomers measured , including the minor ( S,R)-M1 .	
16242871-7	Also an alternative approach , the Bland-Altman test , confirmed the agreement between the two methods .	
16242871-8	The different storage conditions tested did not decrease the concentration of PHEMAs but , surprisingly , a clear trend to increase was shown , particularly for ( R,R)-M1 , ( S,R)-M2 and ( R,R)-M2 in samples stored at +4 degrees C for 1 week .	
16242871-9	In conclusion , the study demonstrates that the methods give comparable results .	
16242871-10	Indirectly , this confirms also the main characteristics of PHEMAs , showed in the previous experiments : low biotransformation rates of styrene into PHEMAs ; large inter-individual variability ; and the presence of a clear preference in the excretion of the isomers deriving from ( S)-styrene oxide .	
16242871-11	PHEMAs appear stable under different storage conditions , but further studies are needed to explain the increase of levels that occurs when samples are not kept frozen .	
16242871-12	To avoid pre-analytical errors , samples collected for biomonitoring or research purposes should be frozen as soon as possible , and thawed only one time just before the analysis .	
24126134-0	The inadvertent ingestion of contaminated soil can be a major pathway for chemical exposure to humans .	
24126134-1	Few studies to date have quantified soil ingestion rates to develop exposure estimates for human health risk assessments ( HHRA ) , and almost all of those were for children in suburban/urban environments .	
24126134-2	Here we employed a quantitative mass balance tracer approach on a rural population practicing outdoor activities to estimate inadvertent soil ingestion .	245 24 2
24126134-3	This study followed 9 subjects over a 13 day period in Cold Lake , Alberta , near the largest in situ thermal heavy oil ( bitumen ) extraction operation in the world .	
24126134-4	The mean soil ingestion rate in this study using Al Ce , La , and Si tracers was 32 mg d(-1) , with a 90th percentile of 152 mg d(-1) and median soil ingestion rate of 18 mg d(-1) .	245 24 2
24126134-5	These soil ingestion values are greater than the standard recommended soil ingestion rates for HHRA from Health Canada , and are similar to soil ingestion estimates found in the only other study on a rural population .	245 24 2
24139061-0	Little is known about the etiology of neuroblastoma , the most common cancer in infancy .	
24139061-1	In this study , we examined maternal exposure to ambient air toxics in pregnancy in relation to neuroblastoma in the child .	
24139061-2	We ascertained all cases of neuroblastoma listed in the California Cancer Registry 1990-2007 that could be linked to a California birth certificate , and controls were selected at random from California birth records .	
24139061-3	Average air toxics exposures during pregnancy were determined based upon measures from community-based air pollution monitors .	2 231 23
24139061-4	The study included 75 cases and 14,602 controls who lived with 5 km of an air pollution monitor , and we additionally examined results for those living within a smaller radius around the monitor ( 2.5 km ) .	2 231 23
24139061-5	Logistic regression was used to determine the risk of neuroblastoma with one interquartile range increase in air toxic exposure .	
24139061-6	Neuroblastoma risk was increased with higher maternal exposure to carbon tetrachloride ( OR=2.65 , 95%CI 1.07 , 6.53 ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( OR=1.39 , 95%CI 1.05 , 1.84 ) , particularly indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and dibenz(a,h)anthracene .	
24139061-7	Hexavalent chromium was associated with neuroblastoma at the 5 km distance ( OR=1.32 , 95%CI 1.00 , 1.74 ) but not at the 2.5 km distance .	
24139061-8	This is one of the first studies to report associations between neuroblastoma and these air toxics .	
16246508-0	In this paper we evaluated the possibility to assess occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) measuring unmetabolized PAHs in urine .	
16246508-1	With this aim , 24 road paving ( RP ) workers , exposed to bitumen fumes , and 6 road construction workers ( CW ) , exposed to diesel exhausts , were investigated .	
16246508-2	Median personal exposure to low boiling PAHs ( from naphthalene to pyrene ) during the work shift ranged from 0.5 to 369 ng/m(3) , with naphthalene as the most abundant compound .	23 2 233
16246508-3	Three urine samples were collected for each worker : baseline ( after 2 days of vacation ) , before- and end-shift samples ( in the second part of the work week ) .	1 12 127
16246508-4	The following urinary compounds were measured by headspace-solid phase microextraction GC/MS : naphthalene ( U-NAP ) , acenaphthylene ( U-ACY ) , acenaphthene ( U-ACE ) , fluorene ( U-FLE ) , phenanthrene ( U-PHE ) , anthracene ( U-ANT ) , fluoranthene ( U-FLU ) , pyrene ( U-PYR ) .	1 12 127
16246508-5	Urinary PAHs were detected in almost all samples .	1 12 127
16246508-6	Median levels for U-NAP , U-PHE , U-PYR and U-FLE in end-shift samples were 82 , 48 , 54 and 21 ng/L in RP and 69 , 14 , 24 and 15 ng/L in CW , respectively .	
16246508-7	Significant differences in the levels of U-PHE , U-FLU and U-PYR were found between RP and CW ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
16246508-8	Moreover in RP samples the urinary excretion of most analytes increased during the work shift ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	1 12 127
16246508-9	These results suggest that urinary PAHs may be useful biomarkers of occupational exposure .	1 12
24140497-0	Smoking cigarette increases levels of certain ethylated DNA adducts in certain tissues and urine .	
24140497-1	Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor of various cancers and DNA ethylation is involved in smoking-related carcinogenesis .	
24140497-2	Among the ethylated DNA adducts , O(2)-ethylthymidine ( O(2)-edT ) and the promutagenic O(4)-ethylthymidine ( O(4)-edT ) are poorly repaired and they can accumulate in vivo .	
24140497-3	Using an accurate , highly sensitive , and quantitative assay based on stable isotope dilution nanoflow liquid chromatography-nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS ) , O(2)-edT , N(3)-edT ( N(3)-ethylthymidine ) , and O(4)-edT adducts in human salivary DNA were simultaneous detected and quantified .	1 12 125
24140497-4	Saliva is easily accessible and available and it can be a potential target in searching for noninvasive biomarkers .	
24140497-5	Under the highly selected reaction monitoring ( H-SRM ) mode , salivary samples from 20 smokers and 13 nonsmokers were analyzed .	1 12 125
24140497-6	Starting with 50 Î¼g of DNA isolated from about 3.5 mL of saliva , levels of O(2)-edT , N(3)-edT , and O(4)-edT in 20 smokers ' salivary DNA samples were 5.3Â±6.2 , 4.5Â±5.7 , 4.2Â±8.0 in 10(8) normal nucleotides , respectively , while those in 13 nonsmokers were non-detectable .	
24140497-7	In addition , statistically significant correlations ( p&lt;0.0001 ) were observed between levels of O(2)-edT and N(3)-edT ( Î³=0.7388 ) , between levels of O(2)-edT and O(4)-edT ( Î³=0.8839 ) , and between levels of N(3)-edT , and O(4)-edT ( Î³=0.7835 ) .	
24140497-8	To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of detection and quantification of these three ethylthymidine adducts in human salivary DNA , which might be potential biomarkers for exposure to ethylating agents and possibly for cancer risk assessment .	1 12
16253310-0	We conducted a study within the framework of the interdisciplinary European Mercury Emission from Chloralkali Plants ( EMECAP ) project to assess exposure to mercury ( Hg ) and the contribution of Hg emissions from a mercury cell chloralkali plant to urinary mercury ( U-Hg ) in adults living near the plant .	1 12 127
16253310-1	We collected data from questionnaires and first morning urine samples from 75 subjects living near the Tarnow plant in Poland and 100 subjects living in a reference area .	1 12 127
16253310-2	Median U-Hg was 0.32 mug/g creatinine ( microg/gC ) and 0.20 microg/gC , respectively .	
16253310-3	The median U-Hg was also higher in the amalgam-free subjects living near the plant ( 0.26 microg/gC ) than in the reference group ( 0.18 microg/gC ) , but no such association was found in a multivariate analysis .	24 244 2
16253310-4	There was a statistically significant positive association between U-Hg and number of teeth with amalgams , a negative association with age and a tendency towards higher U-Hg in female subjects .	24 244 2
16253310-5	In the amalgam-free subjects there were statistically significant effects of female sex and fish consumption , and a negative association with age .	24 2 243
16253310-6	The additional long-term average air Hg concentration from the plant , based on EMECAP environmental measurements and modelling , was estimated to be 1-3.5 ng/m(3) for the residential study area and should have a very small effect on U-Hg .	
16253310-7	The other Hg emission sources such as coal combustion facilities located nearby should be taken into account in assessing the overall impact of air Hg on U-Hg in this area .	
8452118-0	A case-control study comprising 224 male and 92 female incident lung cancer cases and the same number of individually matched hospital controls was conducted from June 1983 to June 1984 in Guangzhou , People's Republic of China , to evaluate the association between indoor air pollution and lung cancer risk .	2 232 23
8452118-1	Guangzhou residents were exposed to several sources of pollution in their homes , most importantly to cooking fumes .	2 232 23
8452118-2	Increased risks were found among subjects living in a house without a separate kitchen ( the exposure odds ratio was 2.4 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 1.4-4.2 ) for men and 5.9 ( 95% CI 2.1-16.0 ) for women ) .	
8452118-3	Similarly , living in a house with poor air circulation was associated with an exposure odds ratio of 2.1 ( 95% CI 1.2-3.8 ) for men and 3.6 ( 95% CI 1.4-9.3 ) for women .	
8452118-4	A trend in the association between lung cancer risk and factors pertaining to house and kitchen ventilation was observed , and a decreasing risk of lung cancer was observed for several variables indicating better ventilation , even after adjustment for potential confounders such as education , occupation , living area , smoking , and history of chronic respiratory diseases .	
8452118-5	No statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls for frequency of cooking at home , presence of a chimney in the kitchen , or type of cooking fuel .	2 232 23
8452118-6	Smoking was clearly related to risk of lung cancer in both men and women , and among nonsmoking women , exposure to tobacco smoke from their spouses was also associated with an increased risk .	
8452118-7	These results suggest that , in addition to smoking , indoor air pollution may be a risk factor for lung cancer .	
22094717-0	BACKGROUND Indoor air pollutants ( IAPs ) cause multiple health impacts .	2 23
22094717-1	Prioritizing mitigation options that differentially affect individual pollutants and comparing IAPs with other environmental health hazards require a common metric of harm .	
22094717-2	OBJECTIVES Our objective was to demonstrate a methodology to quantify and compare health impacts from IAPs .	
22094717-3	The methodology is needed to assess population health impacts of large-scale initiatives-including energy efficiency upgrades and ventilation standards-that affect indoor air quality ( IAQ ) .	
22094717-4	METHODS Available disease incidence and disease impact models for specific pollutant-disease combinations were synthesized with data on measured concentrations to estimate the chronic heath impact , in disability-adjusted life-years ( DALYs ) lost , due to inhalation of a subset of IAPs in U.S. residences .	2 23
22094717-5	Model results were compared with independent estimates of DALYs lost due to disease .	
22094717-6	RESULTS Particulate matter â¤ 2.5 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5 ) , acrolein , and formaldehyde accounted for the vast majority of DALY losses caused by IAPs considered in this analysis , with impacts on par or greater than estimates for secondhand tobacco smoke and radon .	
22094717-7	Confidence intervals of DALYs lost derived from epidemiology-based response functions are tighter than those derived from toxicology-based , interspecies extrapolations .	
22094717-8	Statistics on disease incidence in the United States indicate that the upper-bound confidence interval for aggregate IAP harm is implausibly high .	
22094717-9	CONCLUSIONS The approach demonstrated in this study may be used to assess regional and national initiatives that affect IAQ at the population level .	2 23
22094717-10	Cumulative health impacts from inhalation in U.S. residences of the IAPs assessed in this study are estimated at 400-1,100 DALYs lost annually per 100,000 persons .	2 23
16257145-0	This paper reports an occupational hygiene survey of exposure to acrylamide comparing acrylamide haemoglobin adduct measurements with personal air monitoring and glove liner analysis .	2 233 23
16257145-1	The air monitoring data showed that exposure to acrylamide was well-controlled with all samples below the UK maximum exposure limit ( MEL ) of 300 microg/m(3) with mean exposure about one tenth of the MEL .	2 23
16257145-2	Each worker provided two blood samples approximately 3 months apart .	12 23 1 122 2 233
16257145-3	These samples were well correlated ( r=0.61 ) with a slope of 0.74 , indicating that exposure was reasonably constant .	
16257145-4	Mean personal airborne acrylamide levels and mean acrylamide haemoglobin adduct levels were well correlated ( r=0.72 , N=46 ) and using the calculated linear correlation , exposure at the MEL would be expected to give rise to a haemoglobin adduct level of 1,550 pmol/g globin .	2 233 23
16257145-5	Smoking status did not affect the correlation .	
16257145-6	There was also a correlation between levels of acrylamide detected on gloves and haemoglobin adduct levels .	2
16257145-7	A combined regression model between haemoglobin adducts , airborne acrylamide and acrylamide glove contamination was significant for both airborne acrylamide and gloves with a regression coefficient of 0.89 .	
16257145-8	The study showed that haemoglobin adduct level was a good biomarker of acrylamide exposure which correlated to both inhaled and potentially skin absorbed acrylamide estimates .	1 12
16257145-9	There was excellent discrimination between well-controlled occupational levels and environmental levels from diet and smoking , allowing haemoglobin adduct measurement to be used to determine even low level exposures .	
16257145-10	Due to the complexity of the current methodology , new techniques would be useful in making haemoglobin adducts more widely applicable .	
24144938-0	Environmental exposure to heavy metals is a well-known risk factor for cancers .	
24144938-1	To evaluate potential health risks of heavy metals ( Cr , Cd , Pb , As and Hg ) and Se in cultivated topsoil and grains , we investigated the concentrations of Hg , As and Se using atomic fluorescence spectrometry and Cr , Cd and Pb using inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) .	245 24 2 243
24144938-2	We also analyzed human cancer tissues for heavy metals .	
24144938-3	Potential health risks for local residents were evaluated by calculating the hazard index ( HI ) and the total carcinogenic risk ( TCR ) for soil heavy metals and the target hazard quotient ( THQ ) and the carcinogenic risk ( CR ) for grain heavy metals .	245 24 2 243
24144938-4	A bioconcentration factor ( BCF ) was applied to quantify the bioaccumulation of heavy metals .	
24144938-5	Our results demonstrated that the mean concentrations of heavy metals in soil were all within the safety limits set by FAO/WHO and Chinese regulations ; however , the mean concentrations of Cr and Hg in grain exceeded the safety limits .	245 24 2 243
24144938-6	HI and TCR for soil heavy metals were all within acceptable levels , but the THQ for four grain heavy metals exceeded the target value of 1 ( Cr , 2.64 ; Pb , 1.41 ; As , 1.24 ; Hg , 1.07 ; Cd , 0.39 ) .	
24144938-7	The grain CR for Cr , Pb and As exceeded the accepted risk level of 10(-6) .	
24144938-8	BCF values indicated that the bioaccumulation capacity decreased in the following sequence : Hg&gt;Se&gt;Cd&gt;Cr&gt;Pb&gt;As .	
24144938-9	We also observed statistically significant correlations of topsoil Pb concentration with human gastric cancer and grain Hg with human liver cancer .	245 24 2
24144938-10	Therefore , long-term low dose exposure of heavy metals may play a key role in tumorigenesis , and it may not be necessary to accumulate a high concentration of heavy metals in the human body for those metals to induce tumorigenesis .	
16260099-0	Recent advances on biomarker research are discussed , primarily relying on experience gained with technologies based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS-MS ) .	
16260099-1	Determination of urinary metabolites of industrial chemicals ( n-hexane , benzene , toluene , and styrene ) in samples from occupationally exposed workers and controls was performed by LC-MS-MS with either electrospray ( ESI ) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization ( APCI ) , as appropriate .	1 12 127
16260099-2	Both phase I and II metabolites ( glucuronides , sulfates , and mercapturic acids ) can be detected with little or no sample manipulation , thus allowing the identification of a number of artifacts and " new " metabolites .	
16260099-3	However , experimental evidence indicates the need for properly addressing the matrix effect , which is always associated with the analysis of biological samples .	
16260099-4	Both efficient sample preparation and the use of isotopically labeled internal standards seem to be necessary to develop validated quantitative methods .	
22086566-0	BACKGROUND Benzene is an industrial chemical that causes blood disorders , including acute myeloid leukemia .	
22086566-1	We previously reported that occupational exposures near the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit ( 8 hr ) of 1 ppm was associated with sperm aneuploidy .	
22086566-2	OBJECTIVE We investigated whether occupational exposures near 1 ppm increase the incidence of sperm carrying structural chromosomal aberrations .	1111 1 111 11
22086566-3	METHODS We applied a sperm fluorescence in situ hybridization assay to measure frequencies of sperm carrying partial chromosomal duplications or deletions of 1cen or 1p36.3 or breaks within 1cen-1q12 among 30 benzene-exposed and 11 unexposed workers in Tianjin , China , as part of the China Benzene and Sperm Study ( C-BASS ) .	1 1111 111 11
22086566-4	Exposed workers were categorized into low- , moderate- , and high-exposure groups based on urinary benzene ( medians : 2.9 , 11.0 , and 110.6 Âµg/L , respectively ) .	1 12 127
22086566-5	Median air benzene concentrations in the three exposure groups were 1.2 , 3.7 , and 8.4 ppm , respectively .	2 23
22086566-6	RESULTS Adjusted incidence rate ratios ( IRRs ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for all structural aberrations combined were 1.42 ( 95% CI : 1.10 , 1.83 ) , 1.44 ( 95% CI : 1.12 , 1.85 ) , and 1.75 ( 95% CI : 1.36 , 2.24 ) and for deletion of 1p36.3 alone were 4.31 ( 95% CI : 1.18 , 15.78 ) , 6.02 ( 95% CI : 1.69 , 21.39 ) , and 7.88 ( 95% CI : 2.21 , 28.05 ) for men with low , moderate , and high exposure , respectively , compared with unexposed men .	
22086566-7	Chromosome breaks were significantly increased in the high-exposure group [ IRR 1.49 ( 95% CI : 1.10 , 2.02) ] .	1111 1 111 11
22086566-8	CONCLUSIONS Occupational exposures to benzene were associated with increased incidence of chromosomally defective sperm , raising concerns for worker infertility and spontaneous abortions as well as mental retardation and inherited defects in their children .	
22086566-9	Our sperm findings point to benzene as a possible risk factor for de novo 1p36 deletion syndrome .	
22086566-10	Because chromosomal aberrations in sperm can arise from defective stem cells/spermatogonia , our findings raise concerns that occupational exposure to benzene may have persistent reproductive effects in formerly exposed workers .	
22085608-0	Benzene is an important industrial chemical and an environmental contaminant , but the pathogenesis of hematotoxicity induced by chronic occupational benzene exposure ( HCOBE ) remains to be elucidated .	
22085608-1	To gain an insight into the molecular mechanisms and developmental biomarkers for HCOBE , isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ( iTRAQ ) combined with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( 2D-LC-MS/MS ) were utilized .	11 1
22085608-2	Identification and quantitation of differentially expressed proteins between HCOBE cases and healthy control were thus made .	
22085608-3	Expressions of selected proteins were confirmed by western blot and further validated by ELISA .	1111 1 111 11
22085608-4	A total of 159 unique proteins were identified ( â¥95% confidence ) , and relative expression data were obtained for 141 of these in 3 iTRAQ experiments , with fifty proteins found to be in common among 3 iTRAQ experiments .	11 1 11123 111 1112
22085608-5	Plasminogen ( PLG ) was found to be significantly up-regulated , whereas platelet basic protein ( PBP ) and apolipoprotein B100 ( APOB100 ) were significantly down-regulated in the serum of HCOBE cases .	
22085608-6	Additionally , the altered proteins were associated with the molecular functions of binding , catalytic activity , enzyme regulator activity and transporter activity , and involved in biological processes of apoptosis , developmental and immune system process , as well as response to stimulus .	
22085608-7	Furthermore , differential expressions of PLG , PBP and APOB100 were confirmed by western blot , and the clinical relevance of PBP and APOB100 with HCOBE was validated by ELISA .	
22085608-8	Overall , our results showed that lowered expression of PBP and APOB100 proteins served as potential biomarkers of HCOBE , and may play roles in the benzene-induced immunosuppressive effects and disorders in lipid metabolism .	
24161448-0	Because people tend to move from one place to another during the day , their exposure to air pollution will be determined by the concentration at each location combined with the exposure encountered in transport .	
24161448-1	In order to estimate the exposure of individuals in a population more accurately , the activity-based modeling framework for Black Carbon exposure assessment , AB(2)C , was developed .	2
24161448-2	An activity-based traffic model was applied to model the whereabouts of individual agents .	
24161448-3	Exposure to black carbon ( BC ) in different microenvironments is assessed with a land use regression model , combined with a fixed indoor/outdoor factor for exposure in indoor environments .	2 231 23
24161448-4	To estimate exposure in transport , a separate model was used taking into account transport mode , timing of the trip and degree of urbanization .	
24161448-5	The modeling framework is validated using weeklong time-activity diaries and BC exposure as revealed from a personal monitoring campaign with 62 participants .	2 233 23
24161448-6	For each participant in the monitoring campaign , a synthetic population of 100 model-agents per day was made up with all agents meeting similar preconditions as each real-life agent .	
24161448-7	When these model-agents pass through every stage of the modeling framework , it results in a distribution of potential exposures for each individual .	
24161448-8	The AB(2)C model estimates average personal exposure slightly more accurately compared to ambient concentrations as predicted for the home subzone ; however the added value of a dynamic model lies in the potential for detecting short term peak exposures rather than modeling average exposures .	
24161448-9	The latter may bring new opportunities to epidemiologists : studying the effect of frequently repeated but short exposure peaks on long term exposure and health .	
16289241-0	BACKGROUND Modern persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) contamination are logical candidates in the investigation of the , as yet , unexplained association between allergic disease and progressive industrialisation .	
16289241-1	POPs have been detected in human cord blood , placental tissues and breast milk , and the reported association between cord blood IgE levels and cord/placental POP levels has raised concerns about potential immunological effects in early life .	
16289241-2	METHODS The initial aim of this study was to determine if POPs were detectable in maternal blood , cord blood , placental tissues , adipose tissue and breast milk samples from randomly selected Western Australian women ( n = 31 ) , where allergic disease is epidemic .	12 1 121 122 124 126
16289241-3	Gas chromatography was used to detect polychlorinated biphenyl compounds [ PCBs ] ( as Aroclor 1232 , 1254 , 1260 ) and organochlorine ( OC ) pesticides , including p,p'-DDT , p,p'-DDE , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , lindane , heptachlor epoxide , dieldrin and chlordane .	
16289241-4	Secondly , we assessed the relationship between POP levels detected in vivo and maternal and neonatal responses ( cytokine and lymphoproliferation ) to allergens and mitogens .	11 1 1113 11123 111 1112
16289241-5	RESULTS Low level POP contamination was detected in adipose tissue and breast milk ( but not in cord blood , maternal blood or placental tissues ) .	12 1 121 122 124 126
16289241-6	The most ubiquitous compound found in over 90% of adipose tissues samples was a OC metabolite of DDT , p,p'-DDE ( median 0.07 mg/kg ; interquartile range [ IQR ] 0.05-0.12 ) .	1 121 12
16289241-7	However , the majority of other OC compounds were not detectable and PCB were not detectable in any samples .	
16289241-8	The three main residues detected in breast milk were p,p'-DDE ( 0.003 mg/l ; 0.001-0.009 ) , dieldrin ( 0.001 mg/l ; 0.001-0.046 ) and HCB ( 0.001 mg/l ; 0.001-0.001 ) .	1 12 124
16289241-9	These levels are significantly lower than reported over 20 years ago .	
16289241-10	There were no consistent relationships between POP levels in vivo and maternal or infant responses , with the exception of a significant inverse association ( Spearman rank correlation : r = -0.406 , p = 0.049 ) between maternal adipose tissue levels of OC p,p'-DDE and maternal T helper cell Type 1 interferon [ IFN ] gamma to mitogens .	1 121 12
16289241-11	CONCLUSION This study provides the first evidence ( in Australia ) since the early 1990's that adipose OC levels have continued to fall .	
16289241-12	The negligible levels in this randomly selected group are significantly lower than those previously recorded , suggesting that POP contamination ( at biologically relevant levels ) is not likely to be a major contributing factor in the increasing rates of allergy in Western Australia .	
16289241-13	However , the relationship between Th1 immune function and OC contamination is consistent with other reports and is worth investigating as a relevant factor in populations where OC contamination is greater .	
24184663-0	Low molecular weight cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes ( cVMSs ) are widely employed as emollients and carrier solvents in personal care formulations in order to acquire desired performance benefits owing to their distinctive physicochemical properties .	
24184663-1	Under current European legislation cosmetic ingredients such as cVMSs are required to be labeled on the product package only qualitatively , while for the assessment of environmental and consumer exposure quantitative information is needed .	
24184663-2	The aim of this study was therefore to measure concentrations of three cVMSs , namely octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane ( D4 ) , decamethylcyclopentasiloxane ( D5 ) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane ( D6 ) in 51 cosmetics and personal care products ( C&amp;PCPs ) that are currently available on the European market .	
24184663-3	The list of selected articles comprised a variety of hair and sun care products , skin creams and lotions , deodorants including antiperspirants , liquid foundations and a toothpaste .	
24184663-4	The target compounds were extracted from the products with different organic solvents dependent on the product matrix , followed by gas chromatography analysis with flame ionization detection ( GC-FID ) .	
24184663-5	D5 was the predominant cVMS with the highest mean and median concentrations in all the C&amp;PCP categories .	
24184663-6	The median concentrations of D5 , D6 and D4 were 142 , 2.3 and 0.053 mg/g in deodorants/antiperspirants ( n = 11 ) ; 44.6 , 30.0mg/g and below the limit of quantification ( &lt;LOQ ; LOQ for D4 = 0.00071 mg/g ) in cosmetics ( n = 5 ) ; 8.4 , 0.32 mg/g and &lt;LOQ in skin care ( n = 16 ) ; 9.6 , 0.18 and 0.0055 mg/g in hair care ( n = 10 ) ; and , 34.8 , 0.53 and 0.0085 mg/g in sun care ( n = 8 ) products , respectively .	
24184663-7	The calculated median aggregate daily dermal exposure to D4 and D5 from multiple C&amp;PCPs was approximately 100 times lower than the current NOAEL derived from chronic inhalation rat studies .	2 22
16289298-0	Contaminated fish poses a difficult challenge throughout the world , on the one hand , fish is a very nutritious food source , while on the other hand it accumulates many toxic substances , including mercury ( Hg ) .	
16289298-1	As part of our efforts in the Brazilian Amazon to maximize nutritional input from fish consumption , a dietary mainstay , and minimize toxic risk , we have been studying the role of selenium ( Se ) , an essential element , that may influence the distribution of Hg in the body and influence Hg neurotoxicity .	
16289298-2	Se , which is naturally present in the soil , is ingested through consumption of various foods , notably fish , mammals and certain plants .	
16289298-3	The objectives of the present study were : ( i ) evaluate whole blood Se ( B-Se ) and Hg ( B-Hg ) ; ( ii ) characterize B-Se variations with respect to socio-demographic and dietary variables ; and ( iii ) examine the relation between B-Se and B-Hg .	24 12 1 122 2 243
16289298-4	A total of 236 persons from six riparian communities of the TapajÃ³s River Basin , a tributary of the Amazon , participated in this study .	
16289298-5	Whole blood Se and Hg were measured and interview administered questionnaires were used to obtain data on socio-demographic variable , smoking and drinking habits , and fish and fruit consumption .	24 12 1 122 2 243
16289298-6	The results show that B-Se are in the upper normal range ( median=284.3 microg/L , range=142.1-2029.3 microg/L ) .	
16289298-7	No individuals presented B-Se deficiency , but 9 participants from the same extended family had relatively high B-Se levels , potentially a threat to their health .	
16289298-8	B-Se varied between communities , was significantly higher among alcohol drinkers and farmers , but not associated with age , sex or tobacco consumption .	
16289298-9	A significant positive relation between B-Se and B-Hg was noted , independently of the overall fish consumption .	
16289298-10	B-Se increased with consumption of Peacock bass ( Cichla sp. ) , a piscivorous fish species , and coconut pulp ( Cocos nucifera L. ) .	24 2 243
16289298-11	The B-Se intercommunity variations may reflect geographic differences in local soil Se levels as well as traditional land use practices in the different ecosystems of the TapajÃ³s River Basin .	
16289298-12	In this population with relatively high exposure to Hg , Se may play an important role .	
16289298-13	Further studies should examine , in this region , the sources of Se , its transmission through the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem and its role with respect to human health .	
24184846-0	BACKGROUND Water disinfection by-products have been associated with an increased cancer risk .	
24184846-1	Micronuclei ( MN ) frequency in lymphocytes is a marker of genomic damage and can predict adult cancer risk .	11 1111 1 111
24184846-2	OBJECTIVE We evaluated maternal exposure to drinking water brominated trihalomethanes ( BTHM ) in relation to MN frequency in maternal and cord blood lymphocytes .	24 2 241
24184846-3	METHODS MN frequency was examined in 214 mothers and 223 newborns from the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete , Greece , in 2007-2008 .	
24184846-4	Residential BTHM water concentrations were estimated during pregnancy using tap water analyses and modeling .	24 2 241
24184846-5	Questionnaires on water related habits were used to estimate BTHM exposure from all routes .	24 2 241
24184846-6	Associations between BTHM and MN frequency were estimated using negative binomial regression .	
24184846-7	RESULTS BTHM concentrations in residential tap water during pregnancy ranged from 0.06 to 7.1 Î¼g/L .	24 2 241
24184846-8	MN frequency in maternal binucleated lymphocytes was found to increase with BTHM concentrations in residential water for exposure during the first [ rate ratio ( RR ) for 1 Î¼g/L=1.05 ; 95% CI : 1.00 , 1.11 ] and second trimesters ( RR for 1 Î¼g/L=1.03 ; 95% CI : 1.00 , 1.06 ) , and through all routes of BTHM exposure during the first trimester ( RR for 1 Î¼g/week=3.14 ; 95% CI : 1.16 , 8.50 ) .	1111 1 111 11
24184846-9	CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that exposure to BTHM may increase the frequency of MN in maternal binucleated lymphocytes .	
21943723-0	There are few longitudinal studies on sick building syndrome ( SBS ) , which include ocular , nasal , throat , and dermal symptoms , headache , and fatigue .	1 11 112
21943723-1	We studied the associations between selected microbial components , fungal DNA , furry pet allergens , and incidence and remission of SBS symptoms in schools in Taiyuan , China .	
21943723-2	The study was based on a two-year prospective analysis in pupils ( N=1143 ) in a random sample of schools in China .	
21943723-3	Settled dust in the classrooms was collected by vacuum cleaning and analyzed for lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , muramic acid ( MuA ) , and ergosterol ( Erg ) .	24 2 242
21943723-4	Airborne dust was collected in Petri dishes and analyzed for cat and dog allergens and fungal DNA .	24 2 242
21943723-5	The relationship between the concentration of allergens and microbial compounds and new onset of SBS was analyzed by multi-level logistic regression .	
21943723-6	The prevalence of mucosal and general symptoms was 33% and 28% , respectively , at baseline , and increased during follow-up .	
21943723-7	At baseline , 27% reported at least one symptom that improved when away from school ( school-related symptoms ) .	
21943723-8	New onset of mucosal symptoms was negatively associated with concentration of MuA , total LPS , and shorter lengths of 3-hydroxy fatty acids from LPS , C14 , C16 , and C18 .	
21943723-9	Onset of general symptoms was negatively associated with C18 LPS .	
21943723-10	Onset of school-related symptoms was negatively associated with C16 LPS , but positively associated with total fungal DNA .	
21943723-11	In general , bacterial compounds ( LPS and MuA ) seem to protect against the development of mucosal and general symptoms , but fungal exposure measured as fungal DNA could increase the incidence of school-related symptoms .	
22047537-0	In animals , perfluorinated chemicals ( PFCs ) , specifically perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfate ( PFOS ) , function as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) alpha agonists .	
22047537-1	However , the relevance of animal ( primarily rodent ) data to humans is unresolved .	
22047537-2	While plasma adiponectin level is very responsive to PPAR gamma agonist drugs , it has not been determined whether adiponectin level is related to serum PFCs concentrations .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 1112
22047537-3	In the present study , 287 subjects ( 12-30 years of age ) were recruited to determine the relationship between serum level of PFCs and serum level of adiponectin .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 1112
22047537-4	The results showed males had higher serum PFOS concentrations than females and that those with metabolic syndrome had lower serum PFOA than controls .	
22047537-5	Besides , it showed regional elevations of the perfluoroundecanoic acid ( PFUA ) ( median concentration : 7.11 ng/mL ) in the study subjects .	
22047537-6	No relationship of PFOA , PFOS , PFUA , and the sum of all four PFCs was found to glucose homeostasis , adiponectin level , lipid profile , and inflammatory markers .	11 1 1112 111 11121
22047537-7	The median and the range of perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) concentration ( in ng/mL ; for four categories corresponding to the &lt;50 , 50-74 , 75-89 , and â¥90th percentiles ) were 0.38 ( 0.38-1.68 ) , 3.22 ( 1.73-4.65 ) , 5.85 ( 4.75-8.29 ) , 10.56 ( 8.40-25.40 ) , respectively .	
22047537-8	After controlling for confounding factors , multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the mean natural log-transformed level of adiponectin increased significantly across categories of PFNA ( in ng/mL ; 8.78 , 8.73 , 9.06 , 9.36 ; P for trend = 0.010 in the full model ) .	
22047537-9	In conclusion , higher serum PFNA concentration is associated with elevated serum adiponectin concentration .	1 122 12
24227017-0	We investigated associations between short-term exposure to air pollution and central augmentation index and augmentation pressure , correlates of arterial stiffness , in a cohort of elderly men in the Boston , Massachusetts , metropolitan area .	11 1 2 112 23
24227017-1	This longitudinal analysis included 370 participants from the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study with up to 2 visits between 2007 and 2011 ( n = 445 ) .	
24227017-2	Augmentation index ( as % ) and augmentation pressure ( in mmHg ) were measured at each visit by using radial artery applanation tonometry for pulse wave analysis and modeled in a mixed effects regression model as continuous functions of moving averages of air pollution exposures ( over 4 hours and 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 days ) .	1 11 112
24227017-3	The results suggest that short-term changes in air pollution were associated with augmentation index and augmentation pressure at several moving averages .	2 23
24227017-4	Interquartile range ( IQR ) increases in 3-day average exposure to particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 Î¼m ( 3.6-Î¼g/m(3) IQR increase ) and sulfate ( 1.4-Î¼g/m(3) IQR increase ) and 1-day average exposure to particle number counts ( 8,741-counts/cm(3) IQR increase ) were associated with augmentation index values that were 0.8% ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.2 , 1.4 ) , 0.6% ( 95% CI : 0.1 , 1.2 ) , and 1.7% ( 95% CI : 0.4 , 2.9 ) higher , respectively .	2 231 23
24227017-5	Overall , the findings were similar for augmentation pressure .	
24227017-6	The findings support the hypothesis that exposure to air pollution may affect vascular function .	
22033362-0	The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) has been increased among people who possess habit of tobacco smoking .	
22033362-1	In the present study , zinc ( Zn ) , copper ( Cu ) , manganese ( Mn ) , lead ( Pb ) and cadmium ( Cd ) were determined in scalp hair samples of smokers and nonsmokers RA patients , residents of Dublin , Ireland .	1 123 12
22033362-2	For comparison purposes scalp hair samples of age and sex matched healthy smokers and nonsmokers were also analyzed .	1 123 12
22033362-3	The concentrations of understudied elements were measured by inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer , prior to microwave assisted acid digestion .	
22033362-4	The validity and accuracy of methodology was checked using certified reference material ( NCS ZC 81002b ) and by the conventional wet acid digestion method on the same certified reference material and on real samples .	
22033362-5	The mean hair Zn , Cu and Mn contents were significantly lower in smokers and nonsmokers RA patients as compared to healthy individuals ( p=0.01-0.001 ) .	1 123 12
22033362-6	Whereas the concentrations of Cd and Pb were significantly higher in scalp hair samples of RA patients of both group ( p&lt;0.001 ) .	
22033362-7	The referent smokers have high level of Cd and Pb in their scalp hair samples as compared to those had not smoking tobacco ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
22033362-8	The ratio of Cd and Pb to Zn , Cu and Mn in scalp hair samples was also calculated .	
22033362-9	The Cd/Zn ratio was higher in smoker RA patients with related to nonsmoker RA and referents .	
22033362-10	This study is compelling evidence in support of positive associations between toxic elements , cigarette smoking , deficiency of essential trace elements and risk of arthritis .	
16337985-0	Serum concentrations of CB-153 and p,p'-DDE were assessed for 354 men and women from the Swedish Fishermen's Families Cohort , and were found to correlate very well ( Pearson's r=0.72 ) .	1 122 12
16337985-1	In this particular cohort the main source of exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds are consumption of contaminated fatty fish .	24 2 243
16337985-2	High correlations between total PCB/CB-153 and p,p'-DDE have also been found in other population with similar exposure , but not in populations whose major source of exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds is not necessarily through the consumption of contaminated sea food .	
16337985-3	The authors suggest that when investigating a possible relation between exposure to persistent organochlorine compounds and different health outcomes in populations with exposure similar to the Swedish Fishermen's Families Cohort , there may be no need to analyze more than either CB-153 or p,p'-DDE .	
21648437-0	For the first time , the exposure of swimmers and workers to haloacetic acids ( HAAs ) in indoor and outdoor pools was evaluated through the analysis of urine samples .	1 12 127
21648437-1	The subjects of this study , 49 volunteers , were male and female workers as well as swimmers ( adults and children ) who regularly attended an indoor pool ( January-June ) and an outdoor one ( July and August ) .	
21648437-2	The results showed that HAAs appeared 20-30 min after exposure and were eliminated within 3 h .	
21648437-3	After 2 h exposure , urine samples taken from workers contained dichloroacetic ( DCAA ) and trichloroacetic ( TCAA ) acids at and ng/L levels since HAAs were aerosolized in the indoor ambient , whereas only DCAA was found in some workers ' urine samples from the outdoor pool but at ng/L levels , despite the fact that the outdoor pools generally had somewhat higher levels of HAAs than the indoor pools .	1 12 127
21648437-4	After 1 h swimming TCAA , DCAA and MCAA were present at concentrations of and ng/L , respectively , in the swimmers ' urine in the indoor pool ; similar results were obtained from the swimmers in the outdoor pool due to accidental ingestion .	
21648437-5	Finally , exposure estimates indicate that ingestion is the major route of exposure ( followed by inhalation ( and dermal contribution (	24 2 22 23
21630299-0	BACKGROUND Overexposure to carbon disulfide ( CS(2) ) has been associated with an increase in coronary heart disease , but the mechanisms mediating this effect remain unclear .	
21630299-1	We aimed to examine the relationship between CS(2) exposure and oxidative stress markers , in order to clarify the oxidative mechanisms involved in CS(2) -induced atherosclerosis .	1 11 111 1114
21630299-2	METHODS A total of 89 workers from a viscose rayon plant were recruited for this study , and 111 workers not exposed to CS(2) served as controls .	
21630299-3	Cholesterol , triglyceride , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase , GSH peroxidase , as well as total antioxidants were analyzed .	11 1 11121 11122 1112 111 1114 11123
21630299-4	RESULTS The workers exposed to CS(2) had significantly higher MDA levels and lower SOD levels than the controls .	
21630299-5	The average MDA levels were 776âÂ±â268.2 ( 240-1,220 ) in the high exposure ( â¥10âppm ; nâ=â38 ) , 751.6âÂ±â274 ( 170-1,320 ) in the low exposure ( &lt;10âppm ; nâ=â51 ) , and 550.4âÂ±â199 ( 115-1,050 ) mM in the control group ( nâ=â111 ) .	
21630299-6	The average SOD levels were 36.5âÂ±â38.8 ( 0-223.5 ) , 39.3âÂ±â38.8 ( 0-160 ) , and 58.8âÂ±â60.8 ( 5.25 , 400)âU/ml in the high exposure- , low exposure- , and control group , respectively .	
21630299-7	MDA level increased significantly at a cumulative CS(2) exposure of over 60 ppm-years .	
21630299-8	Dyslipoproteinemia was borderline significantly associated with CS(2) exposure and MDA level .	
21630299-9	CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that CS(2) exposure can induce oxidative stress as well as reduce the levels of antioxidative enzymes , and that a cumulative exposure level of 60 ppm-years may be a threshold value for the oxidative and the antioxidant response .

24344394-0	Imidacloprid ( IMI ) is a relatively new neuro-active neonicotinoid insecticide and nowadays one of the largest selling insecticides worldwide .	
24344394-1	In the present study a LCâAPCIâMS based method was developed and validated for the quantification of imidacloprid and its main metabolite 6-chloronicotinic acid ( 6- CINA ) in urine and hair specimens .	1 123 12 127
24344394-2	The method was tested in biomonitoring of intentionally exposed animals and subsequently applied for biomonitoring of Cretan urban and rural population .	
24344394-3	The developed analytical method comprises two main steps of analytes isolation from specimen ( solidâ liquid extraction with methanol for hair , liquidâliquid extraction with methanol for urine ) and subsequent instrumental analysis by LCâAPCIâMS .	
24344394-4	The developed method was applied for the monitoring of IMI and 6-ClNA in hair and urine of laboratory animals ( rabbits ) intentionally fed with insecticide at low or high doses ( 40 and 80 mg kg(-1) weight d(-1) respectively ) for 24 weeks .	
24344394-5	The analytes were detected in the regularly acquired hair and urine specimens and their found levels were proportional to the feeding dose and time of exposure with the exception of slight decline of IMI levels in high dose fed rabbits after 24 weeks of feeding .	
24344394-6	This decline can be explained by the induction of IMI metabolizing enzymes by the substrate .	
24344394-7	After testing on animal models the method was applied for pilot biomonitoring of Crete urban ( n = 26 ) and rural ( n = 32 ) population .	
24344394-8	Rural but not urban population is exposed to IMI with 21 positive samples ( 65.6% ) and found median concentration 0.03 ng mg(-1) .	
24344394-9	Maximum concentration detected was 27 ng mg(-1)	
22030285-0	BACKGROUND Recent studies have shown effects of prenatal exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) on infants in the general environmental levels .	
22030285-1	Laboratory animal studies have shown that exposure to PFOS and PFOA is associated with immunotoxic effects .	
22030285-2	OBJECTIVES To investigate the relationship between maternal PFOS and PFOA levels and infant allergies and infectious diseases during the first 18 months of life .	
22030285-3	Cord blood immunoglobulin ( Ig ) E levels were also evaluated .	11 1 11123 111 1112
22030285-4	METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant women from 2002 to 2005 in Sapporo , Japan .	
22030285-5	Maternal PFOS and PFOA levels were measured in relation to cord blood IgE concentrations ( n=231 ) and infant allergies and infectious diseases ( n=343 ) .	
22030285-6	Characteristics of mothers and their infants were obtained from self-administered questionnaires and medical records .	
22030285-7	Development of infant allergies and infectious diseases was determined from self-administered questionnaires at 18 months of age .	
22030285-8	Concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in maternal serum and concentrations of IgE in umbilical cord serum at birth were measured .	1 122 12
22030285-9	RESULTS Cord blood IgE levels decreased significantly with high maternal PFOA concentration among female infants .	
22030285-10	However , there were no significant associations among maternal PFOS and PFOA levels and food allergy , eczema , wheezing , or otitis media in the 18 month-old infants ( adjusted for confounders ) .	
22030285-11	CONCLUSIONS Although cord blood IgE level decreased significantly with high maternal PFOA levels among female infants , no relationship was found between maternal PFOS and PFOA levels and infant allergies and infectious diseases at age in 18 months .	
24345860-0	Coking influences environmental quality and poses high risks to human health as large amounts of heavy metals and metalloids are emitted into the environment from coal during the coking process .	
24345860-1	Health risks depend heavily on multi-pathway and element-specific exposures , which have , unfortunately , been rarely studied .	
24345860-2	In this study , children's health risks and exposure levels to As , Se , and heavy metals ( Pb , Cd , Cr , Ni , Co , Zn , Cu , Mn , V and Sb ) in the water , soil , dust , air and locally produced food were studied based on field sampling and questionnaire-based surveys around the largest coking area in China .	24 245 12 1 122 2 241 243 242
24345860-3	Human blood samples were collected and analyzed to indicate the exposure levels .	1 122 12
24345860-4	The non-carcinogenic risks to children mainly resulted from Cr , Mn , Pb , As and Sb , the levels of which were 3 to 10 times higher than the acceptable levels ( 1.0Ã10(-6) ) .	
24345860-5	The carcinogenic risks to children were 30 to 200 times higher than the safe level ( 1.0Ã10(-6)-1.0Ã10(-4) ) , which could be attributed to Cr , As and Ni pollution .	
24345860-6	The estimated risks mainly came from the pathway involving the ingestion of locally produced food , accounting for more than 85% in total for most elements .	24 2 243
24345860-7	For As , the food ingestion and air inhalation exposure pathways both contributed approximately 50% , respectively .	24 2 243 23
24345860-8	The high risks in this study highlight the attention paid to the health of children who live in the vicinity of coking activities and the importance of site-specific multi-pathway health risk assessments and food safety to protect potentially exposed children .	
16357596-0	BACKGROUND Urinary metabolites of several nonpersistent insecticides have been measured in a high percentage of men in the general population , suggesting widespread environmental exposures to these compounds .	
16357596-1	The present study explored the association of urinary concentrations of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TCPY ) , a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl , and 1-naphthol ( 1N ) , a metabolite of carbaryl and naphthalene , with serum reproductive hormone levels in adult men .	11 12 1 1112 111 127
16357596-2	METHODS Subjects ( n = 268 ) were the male partners in couples presenting to a Massachusetts infertility clinic in years 2000 through 2003 .	
16357596-3	TCPY and 1N were measured in a spot urine sample from each subject and adjusted for dilution using specific gravity .	1 12 127
16357596-4	Reproductive hormones ( follicle-stimulating hormone , leuteinizing hormone , inhibin B , testosterone , and sex hormone-binding globulin ) were measured in serum collected from subjects during the same clinic visit .	11 1 11121 11123 111 1112
16357596-5	RESULTS Multiple linear regression models showed an inverse association between TCPY and testosterone concentration .	11 1 1112 111 11121
16357596-6	An interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in TCPY was associated with a decline of 25 ng/dL ( 95% confidence interval = -40 to -10 ) in testosterone concentration .	
16357596-7	The association appeared to be dose-dependent when exposure was divided into quintiles .	
16357596-8	The highest TCPY quintile was associated with a testosterone decline of 83 ng/dL ( -128 to -39 ) compared with the lowest TCPY quintile .	
16357596-9	We also found inverse associations between TCPY and free androgen index and between 1N and testosterone , and suggestive inverse associations between TCPY and leuteinizing hormone and between 1N and free androgen index .	
16357596-10	CONCLUSION In adult men , TCPY and 1N were associated with reduced testosterone levels .	
16357596-11	On a population level , these reductions are of potential public health importance because of widespread exposure to these nonpersistent insecticides .	
22027495-0	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Long-term exposure to cadmium ( Cd ) causes renal dysfunction , but the change in renal function with exposure is unknown .	
22027495-1	We assessed the evolution of Cd-induced renal effects after a reduction in dietary exposure to Cd in rice .	
22027495-2	METHODS Four hundred twelve residents in previously Cd-polluted and nonpolluted areas were examined twice , in 1998 and in 2006 .	
22027495-3	Changes in blood Cd , urinary Cd , and kidney function [ N-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , Î²2-microglobulin , and albumin in urine ] were measured .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 127 1112
22027495-4	RESULTS In the most polluted area , mean blood Cd was 8.9 Î¼g/L and 3.3 Î¼g/L in 1998 and in 2006 , respectively , and urinary Cd was 11.6 and 9.0 Î¼g/g creatinine .	1 122 12
22027495-5	Urinary albumin in 1998 increased with urinary Cd , but no such exposure-response relation appeared for 2006 albumin versus urinary Cd 1998 , indicating recovery .	11 1 11123 111 1112
22027495-6	Other biomarkers of kidney function were also elevated in 1998 .	11 1
22027495-7	Partial recovery was observed for NAG among women and was suggested for Î²2-microglobulin among young individuals .	
22027495-8	The probability of having Î²2-microglobulin levels above the 95th percentile in 2006 was high in those with elevated Î²2-microglobulin in 1998 [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 24.8 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 11.2 , 55.3 ] compared with albumin ( OR = 3.0 ; 95% CI : 1.2 , 7.5 ) and NAG ( OR = 2.6 ; 95% CI : 1.6 , 4.4 ) .	
22027495-9	CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that a Cd-mediated increase in urinary albumin excretion is reversible upon substantial reduction of exposure .	
22027495-10	For markers of tubular effects , we observed a tendency toward improvement but not complete recovery .	11 1
22027495-11	Data from repeated observations suggest that Î²2-microglobulin may be more informative than NAG as an indicator for an individual's future tubular function .	
24382481-0	Human exposure to persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) and the potential health impact in the Arctic far from the emission sources have been highlighted in numerous studies .	
24382481-1	As a supplement to human POP biomonitoring studies , a physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) model was set up to estimate the fate of POPs in Greenlandic Inuit's liver , blood , muscle and adipose tissue following long-term exposure to traditional Greenlandic diet .	24 2 21 243
24382481-2	The PBPK model described metabolism , excretion and POP accumulation on the basis of their physicochemical properties and metabolic rates in the organisms .	
24382481-3	Basic correlations between chemically analyzed blood POP concentrations and calculated daily POP intake from food questionnaire of 118 middle age ( 18-35years ) Greenlandic Inuits from four cities in West Greenland ( Qaanaaq : n=40 ; Qeqertarsuaq : n=36 ; Nuuk : n=20 ; Narsaq : n=22 ) taken during 2003 to 2006 were analyzed .	24 12 1 122 2 243
24382481-4	The dietary items included were polar bear , caribou , musk oxen , several marine species such as whales , seals , bird and fish as well as imported food .	
24382481-5	The contaminant concentrations of the dietary items as well as their chemical properties , uptake , biotransformation and excretion allowed us to estimate the POP concentration in liver , blood , muscle and adipose tissue following long-term exposure to the traditional Greenlandic diet using the PBPK model .	2 21
24382481-6	Significant correlations were found between chemically analyzed POP blood concentrations and calculated daily intake of POPs for Qeqertarsuaq , Nuuk and Narsaq Inuit but not for the northernmost settlement Qaanaaq , probably because the highest blood POP level was found in this district which might mask the interview-based POP calculations .	1 12 122 2
24382481-7	Despite the large variation in circulating blood POP concentrations , the PBPK model predicted blood concentrations of a factor 2-3 within the actual measured values .	2 21
24382481-8	Moreover , the PBPK model showed that estimated blood POP concentration increased significantly after consumption of meals .	2 21
24382481-9	For individuals who had a high internal burden of POPs accumulated over years , the estimated blood levels were less influenced by recent meal intake .	
24382481-10	The model results also indicated that of the POPs accumulated in the body the concentrations were highest for CB-153 ( oxychlordane : 0.6% ; DDE and CB-99 : 2.9% ; HCB : 4.4% ; CB-153 : 34.5% ) .	
24382481-11	Furthermore , the model also estimated a significant internal body POP burden even several years after the mentioned dietetic shift and that contaminant accumulation was 2-6 folds faster than the decay after a shift to a diet low in contaminants .	
24382481-12	Using the PBPK model approach , we seek to improve the knowledge on contaminant body burden in humans of the Arctic .	
24382481-13	However , it should be noted that calculations of daily POP intake may be subject to considerable uncertainty due to imprecise information from the dietary interview .	
24382481-14	Based on these results we suggest that PBPK modeling is implemented as a tool in future human health exposure and effect assessments in Greenland .	
16362951-0	BACKGROUND Dental laboratory technicians are exposed to dust and/or methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in the workplace .	
16362951-1	Potential effects of the exposures on lung function merit further clarification .	
16362951-2	METHODS This study measured lung function of 45 dental technicians , before and after shifts , on 3 workdays and monitored workplace concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mm ( PM2.5 ) and MMA in five dental laboratories in Taiwan .	11 23 1 2 112 232
16362951-3	Base metals in particles were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence .	
16362951-4	Repeated measurement analysis was applied to estimate potential effects of PM2.5 on pulmonary function .	
16362951-5	RESULTS PM2.5 ranged from 26 microg/m3 to 664 microg/m3 and levels of MMA were low in these laboratories .	
16362951-6	Nickel , cobalt , and chromium were detected in the particles .	
16362951-7	After controlling for important factors , PM2.5 was associated with a small decrease in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory flow in one second .	1 11 112
16362951-8	CONCLUSION Workplace PM2.5 was associated with a non-significant decrease in lung function of dental technicians .	
22018858-0	An evolving body of evidence suggests an adverse relation between persistent organochlorine pollutants ( POPs ) and menstruation , though prospective longitudinal measurement of menses is limited and served as the impetus for study .	
22018858-1	We prospectively assessed the relation between a mixture of persistent organochlorine compounds and menstrual cycle length and duration of bleeding in a cohort of women attempting to become pregnant .	1 11 112
22018858-2	Eighty-three ( 83% ) women contributing 447 cycles for analysis provided a blood specimen for the quantification of 76 polychlorinated biphenyls and seven organochlorine pesticides , and completed daily diaries on menstruation until a human chorionic gonadotropin confirmed pregnancy or 12 menstrual cycles without conception .	11 1 122 12 112
22018858-3	Gas chromatography with electron capture detection was used to quantify concentrations ( ng g(-1)serum ) ; enzymatic methods were used to quantify serum lipids ( mg dL(-1) ) .	
22018858-4	A linear regression model with a mixture distribution was used to identify chemicals grouped by purported biologic activity that significantly affected menstrual cycle length and duration of bleeding adjusting for age at menarche and enrollment , body mass index , and cigarette smoking .	
22018858-5	A significant 3-d increase in cycle length was observed for women in the highest tertile of estrogenic PCB congeners relative to the lowest tertile ( Î²=3.20 ; 95% CI 0.36 , 6.04 ) .	
22018858-6	A significant reduction in bleeding ( &lt;1 d ) was observed among women in the highest versus lowest tertile of aromatic fungicide exposure ( Î³=-0.15 ; 95% CI -0.29 , -0.00 ) .	
22018858-7	Select POPs were associated with changes in menstruation underscoring the importance of assessing chemical mixtures for female fecundity .	
16376969-0	A study of the dietary intake of dioxins , consisting of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dioxin-like PCBs ) through foods retailed in the metropolitan Tokyo area from 1999 to 2004 was carried out by the total diet-market basket method on the basis of food classification ( 14 groups ) and the data on food consumption in the Tokyo region obtained from the Japan Nutrition Survey .	24 2 243
16376969-1	The daily intake of dioxins per kg of body weight for a 50 kg average adult body was 2.18 pg TEQ/kg/day in 1999 , 1.87 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2000 , 1.25 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2001 , 1.60 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2002 and 2003 and 1.55 pg TEQ/kg/day in 2004 , respectively .	2
16376969-2	These amounts were less than the tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) of 4 pg TEQ/kg/day for dioxins established in Japan .	
16376969-3	The dioxins taken daily through fish and shellfish ( group 10 ) accounted for more than 50% of sum WHO-TEQs .	24 2 243
16376969-4	In addition , more than 90% of the daily intake of dioxins was taken through fish and shellfish ( group 10 ) , meat and eggs ( group 11 ) , milk and dairy products ( group 12 ) .	24 2 243
16376969-5	Also , this study clearly showed that the ratio of dioxin-like PCBs in the daily intake of dioxins was increasing yearly because the reduction rate of dioxin-like PCBs was lower than that of PCDDs and PCDFs in foods .	
24437044-0	The First National Environmental Health Survey of Child Care Centers was conducted to provide information about lead , allergen , and pesticide levels in licensed U.S. child care centers .	24 244 2 242
24437044-1	Lead levels were measured in settled dust , paint , and play area soil ; indoor allergen levels were measured in settled dust ; and pesticide residues were measured on indoor surfaces and in play area soil .	24 245 2 242 244
24437044-2	Fourteen percent of centers had significant lead hazards , suggesting that an estimated 470,000 children under age six ( approximately 10% of all children in licensed centers ) attend centers with significant lead hazards .	
24437044-3	Approximately 5% of centers had levels of allergens associated with asthma and allergic conditions .	
24437044-4	Three-quarters of centers had pesticides applied ( either indoors or outdoors ) during the previous year .	
24437044-5	Although most centers did not appear to present risks from lead and allergens , some centers did have unsafe levels of these contaminants .	
24437044-6	These conclusions cannot be generalized to unlicensed child care arrangements .	
15674318-0	Breastfeeding has been associated with an advantage to infant neurobehavioral development , possibly in part due to essential nutrients in breast milk .	
15674318-1	However , breast milk may be contaminated by environmental neurotoxicants , such as methylmercury .	
15674318-2	In the Faroe Islands , where maternal consumption of pilot whale may cause transfer of marine toxicants into breast milk , a cohort of 1022 consecutive singleton births was generated during 1986-87 .	
15674318-3	Methylmercury exposure was assessed from mercury concentrations in cord blood and in the hair of the child at age 12 months , and the duration of breastfeeding was recorded .	1 122 12 123
15674318-4	At approximately 7 years of age , 917 ( 90% ) of the children underwent detailed neurobehavioral examination .	1 11 112
15674318-5	After adjustment for confounders , breastfeeding was associated with only marginally better neuropsychological performance on most tests .	
15674318-6	These associations were robust even after adjustment for cord-blood and hair mercury concentration at age 1 year .	1 122 12 123
15674318-7	Thus , in this cohort of children with a relatively high prenatal toxicant exposure and potential exposure to neurotoxicants through breast milk , breastfeeding was associated with less benefits on neurobehavioral development than previously published studies though not associated with a deficit in neuropsychological performance at age 7 .	
15674318-8	Although the advantage may be less , Faroese women can still safely breastfeed their children .	
22003970-0	Exposure of humans and wildlife to various inorganic and organometallic forms of mercury ( Hg ) may induce adverse health effects .	
22003970-1	While human populations in developed countries are mainly exposed to marine fish monomethylmercury ( MMHg ) , this is not necessarily the case for developing countries and diverse indigenous people .	
22003970-2	Identification of Hg exposure sources from biomonitor media such as urine or hair would be useful in combating exposure .	
22003970-3	Here we report on the Hg stable isotope signatures and Hg speciation in human hair across different gold miner , indigenous and urban populations in Bolivia and France .	1 123 12
22003970-4	We found evidence for both mass-dependent isotope fractionation ( MDF ) and mass-independent isotope fractionation ( MIF ) in all hair samples .	1 123 12
22003970-5	Three limiting cases of dominant exposure to inorganic Hg ( IHg ) , freshwater fish MMHg , and marine fish MMHg sources are used to define approximate Hg isotope source signatures .	24 2 243
22003970-6	Knowing the source signatures , we then estimated Hg exposure sources for the Bolivian gold miner populations .	
22003970-7	Modeled IHg levels in hair correspond well to measured IHg concentrations ( R = 0.9 ) , demonstrating that IHg exposure sources to gold miners can be monitored in hair samples following either its chemical speciation or isotopic composition .	2
22003970-8	Different MMHg and inorganic exposure levels among gold miners appear to correspond to living and working conditions , including proximity to small towns , and artisanal vs large scale mining activity .	
22003413-0	BACKGROUND Although strong exposure to arsenic has been shown to be carcinogenic , its contribution to lung cancer incidence in the United States is not well characterized .	
22003413-1	We sought to determine if the low-level exposures to arsenic seen in the U.S. are associated with lung cancer incidence after controlling for possible confounders , and to assess the interaction with smoking behavior .	
22003413-2	METHODOLOGY Measurements of arsenic stream sediment and soil concentration obtained from the USGS National Geochemical Survey were combined , respectively , with 2008 BRFSS estimates on smoking prevalence and 2000 U.S. Census county level income to determine the effects of these factors on lung cancer incidence , as estimated from respective state-wide cancer registries and the SEER database .	245 24 2
22003413-3	Poisson regression was used to determine the association between each variable and age-adjusted county-level lung cancer incidence .	
22003413-4	ANOVA was used to assess interaction effects between covariates .	
22003413-5	PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Sediment levels of arsenic were significantly associated with an increase in incident cases of lung cancer ( P&lt;0.0001 ) .	245 24 2
22003413-6	These effects persisted after controlling for smoking and income ( P&lt;0.0001 ) .	
22003413-7	Across the U.S. , exposure to arsenic may contribute to up to 5,297 lung cancer cases per year .	
22003413-8	There was also a significant interaction between arsenic exposure levels and smoking prevalence ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
22003413-9	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Arsenic was significantly associated with lung cancer incidence rates in the U.S. after controlling for smoking and income , indicating that low-level exposure to arsenic is responsible for excess cancer cases in many parts of the U.S. Elevated county smoking prevalence strengthened the association between arsenic exposure and lung cancer incidence rate , an effect previously unseen on a population level .	
20434775-0	Lifetime exposure to trihalomethanes ( THMs ) through ingestion , inhalation and dermal contacts may pose risks to human health .	
20434775-1	Current approaches may under predict THMs exposure by using THMs in cold water during showering and bathing .	
20434775-2	Warming of chlorinated water during showering may increase THMs formation through reactions between organics and residual chlorine , which can increase human health risks .	
20434775-3	In this study , THMs concentrations in shower water were estimated using THMs rate increase model .	24 2 241
20434775-4	Using cold water THMs , exposure through ingestion was estimated , while THMs exposure during showering was estimated using THMs in warm water .	24 2 241
20434775-5	Human health cancer risks and additional expenses for 20 most populated Canadian cities from exposure to THMs were estimated .	
20434775-6	Inhalation and dermal contact during showering contributed 30% to 50% of total cancer risks , while risks from inhalation and dermal contacts were comparable for all cities .	2 22 23
20434775-7	Overall cancer risks were estimated between 7.2 x 10(-6) and 6.4 x 10(-5) for these cities .	
20434775-8	Cancer incidents were estimated highest for Montreal ( 94/year ) followed by Toronto ( 53/year ) , which may require additional medical expenses of 18.8 and 10.7 million dollars/year for Montreal and Toronto respectively .	
20434775-9	Cancer risks from exposure to THMs can be controlled by reducing THMs in water supply and varying shower stall volume , shower duration and air exchange rate in shower stall .	
16399001-0	People in developing countries are often considered at greater risk of mercury ( Hg ) poisoning due to a variety of factors including a lack of awareness regarding their occupational risks .	
16399001-1	Individuals requiring urine mercury ( U-Hg ) analysis at the Center for Toxicological Investigations of the University of Carabobo ( CITUC ) , between 1998 and 2002 were studied to identify demographic characteristics associated to U-Hg levels .	1 12 127
16399001-2	The studied population included individuals with a history of exposure ( or related exposures ) to Hg processes , and was comprised of 1159 individuals ( 65 children , 1094 adults ) ages 0.58-79 years old , mean 36.63+/-12.4 .	
16399001-3	Children's geometric mean U-Hg levels were 2.73 microg/g Creatinine ( Ct ) and in adults 2.55 microg/g Ct .	1 12 127
16399001-4	The highest frequency of adults ' occupations were shipyard workers ( 35.47% ) , dentists ( 23.5% ) , lab technicians ( 11.43% ) , dental employees 10.42% and miners ( 10.2% ) .	
16399001-5	Chemical laboratory technicians had the highest mean U-Hg ( 4.46 microg/g Ct ) .	
16399001-6	Mean U-Hg levels in female adults ( 3.45 microg/g Ct ) were statistically superior to levels in male adults ( 2.15 microg/g Ct ) .	
16399001-7	Two of the 172 women in reproductive age , had U-Hg levels higher than 78 microg/g Ct .	
16399001-8	Individuals from Falcon State were found to have the highest mean U-Hg ( 4.53 microg/g Ct ) .	
16399001-9	U-Hg levels higher than permissible limits were found in only 2 states ( Carabobo and Bolivar ) with a total of 24 cases .	
16399001-10	Although the results of this investigation were highly variable , the findings can be used to examine circumstances which influence mercury toxicity trends , and possibly used in future studies working to identify Hg exposures .	
22001329-0	Human biomonitoring is an important indicator and measure of exposure to environmental chemicals and provides information to support health protection policies and programs .	
22001329-1	Cycle 1 ( 2007-2009 ) of the Canadian Health Measures Survey ( CHMS ) collected and analyzed biological samples from over 5600 males and females aged 6-79 years , which established national representative blood and urine concentrations for a number of environmental chemicals including metals , organophosphate insecticide metabolites , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , organochlorines ( OCs ) , perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , and cotinine .	1 122 12 127
22001329-2	The results of CHMS Cycle 1 indicate that while some organophosphate insecticide metabolites were below limits of detection for most participants , metals , PCBs , OCs , PFCs and BPA were detected in almost all blood or urine samples .	1 122 12 127
22001329-3	Significant differences ( p&lt;0.05 ) in blood concentrations between males and females were also determined for several metals ( e.g. , lead for males and females was 15.1 and 11.8 Î¼g/L , respectively ) , PFCs ( e.g. , PFOS for males and females was 11.13 and 7.07 Î¼g/L , respectively ) , and OCs ( e.g. , p,p'-DDE for males and females was 134.43 and 172.07 Î¼g/kg lipid , respectively ) and in urine concentrations for BPA ( 1.29 and 1.04 Î¼g/L for males and females , respectively ) .	1 122 12 127
22001329-4	Future cycles of the CHMS will permit temporal trend analysis for a number of these chemicals .	
20216574-0	Parabens are used as anti-microbial preservatives in a range of consumer products , especially in cosmetics .	
20216574-1	In vitro and animal studies have shown weak estrogenic and other endocrine disrupting effects of parabens , including reduced testosterone levels in exposed male rats .	
20216574-2	The knowledge of paraben exposure , distribution and excretion in humans is limited .	
20216574-3	In this study we determined the concentration of five parabens ; methyl- , ethyl- , n-propyl- , n-butyl- and benzylparaben in urine , serum and seminal plasma samples from 60 healthy Danish men .	1 122 12 125 127
20216574-4	To conduct the study a sensitive and specific method using LC-MS/MS for simultaneous determination of the five parabens was developed for all three different matrices .	
20216574-5	Highest concentrations of the parabens were found in urine , wherein methyl- , ethyl- , n-propyl- and n-butyl parabens were measurable in 98% , 80% , 98% and 83% of the men , respectively .	1 12 127
20216574-6	Benzyl paraben was only measurable in urine from 7% of the men .	1 12 127
20216574-7	Methyl- and n-propyl parabens were also measurable in the majority of serum and seminal plasma samples , whereas the other parabens could only be detected in some of the samples .	1 122 12 125
20216574-8	In all the three matrices significant correlations between the parabens were seen .	
20216574-9	Furthermore , urinary paraben concentrations correlate to the paraben concentrations in both serum and seminal plasma .	1 122 12 125
15764539-0	Urinary biomarkers of chlorpyrifos ( CPF ) exposure are often measured in field studies , although biological reference values ( BRVs ) are not yet available to assess health risks .	
15764539-1	This study aimed at proposing BRVs for CPF metabolites in workers ' urine based on a toxicokinetic approach .	
15764539-2	As a first step , a toxicokinetic model was developed , using published human kinetic data , to link the absorbed dose of CPF under a variety of exposure routes and temporal scenarios to the urinary excretion of its major metabolites , 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( 3,5,6-TCP ) and alkyl phosphates ( AP ) .	2 21
15764539-3	The model was then used to propose BRVs for CPF metabolites in urine below which workers should not experience adverse health effects .	
15764539-4	This was achieved by linking ( 1 ) a literature-reported , repeated CPF no-observed-effect level ( NOEL ) daily exposure dose for the inhibition of red-blood-cell acetylcholinesterase activity to a corresponding absorbed daily dose , and ( 2 ) this absorbed daily dose to the urinary excretion of CPF metabolites .	
15764539-5	Model simulations under a variety of exposure scenarios showed that the safest BRVs are obtained from a dermal exposure scenario with the slowest absorption rate compatible with available literature data rather than from respiratory or oral exposure scenarios .	24 2 22 23
15764539-6	Also , model simulations showed that , for a given total absorbed dose , absorption over 8 hours results in smaller 3,5,6-TCP and AP urinary excretion rates than those obtained from the same dose absorbed over shorter durations .	
15764539-7	From these considerations , BRVs were derived by simulating an 8-hour dermal CPF exposure such that the total absorbed daily dose corresponds to the absorbed NOEL .	2 22
15764539-8	The reference values are proposed in the form of total amounts of 3,5,6-TCP and AP metabolites excreted in urine over chosen time periods ( 24 and 48 hours ) .	
16433347-0	Emission rates , decay rates , and cooking durations are reported from continuous PM2.5 ( particulate matter less than 2.5 microm ) concentrations measured using personal DataRam nephelometers ( 1-min time resolution ) from the Research Triangle Park ( RTP ) PM panel study .	2 233 23
16433347-1	The study ( n = 37 participants ) included monitoring for 7 consecutive days in each of four consecutive seasons ( summer 2000 through spring 2001 ) .	
16433347-2	Cooking episodes ( n = 411 ) were selected using time-activity diaries and criteria for cooking event duration , peak concentration level , and decay curve quality .	
16433347-3	Averaged across all cooking events , mean source strengths were 36 mg/min ( median = 12 mg/min ) , mean decay rates were 0.27 h(-1) ( 0.17 h(-1) ) , and mean cooking durations were 11 min ( 7 min ) .	
16433347-4	Cooking events were further separated into one of seven categories representing cooking method : burned food ( oven cooking , toaster , or stovetop cooking ) , grilling , microwave , toaster oven , frying , oven cooking , and stovetop cooking .	
16433347-5	The highest mean source strengths were identified from burned food ( mean = 470 mg/min ) , grilling ( 173 mg/min ) , and frying ( 60 mg/ min ) ; differences between both burned food and grilling compared with all remaining cooking methods were statistically significant .	
16433347-6	Source strengths , decay rates , and cooking durations were also compared by season and typical meal times ( 8:00 a.m. , 12:00 p.m. , and 6:00 p.m. ) ; differences were generally not statistically significant for these cases .	
16433347-7	Mean source strengths using electric appliances were typically a factor of 2 greater than those using gas appliances for identical cooking methods ( frying , oven cooking , or stovetop cooking ) , although in all cases the difference was not statistically significant .	
16433347-8	Distributions of source strengths and decay rates for cooking events were also compared among study subjects to assess both within- and between-subject variability .	
16433347-9	Each subject's distribution of source strengths during the study tended to be either lower than the overall study average ( and with lower variability ) or higher than the overall study average ( and with higher variability ) .	
16433347-10	No relationships could be found between source strength and either subject characteristics ( age , gender , employment status ) or home characteristic ( daily air exchange rate ) .	
16433347-11	The large number of cooking events and the broad range of cooking activities included in this analysis makes the reported distributions of PM2.5 source strengths useful for probabilistic exposure modeling even though the study population was limited .	
16436274-0	Previously , we investigated the association between urinary cadmium ( Cd ) concentration and indicators of renal dysfunction , including total protein , beta2-microglobulin ( beta2-MG ) , and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) .	11 1 11123 111 1112
16436274-1	In 2778 inhabitants 50 years of age ( 1114 men , 1664 women ) in three different Cd nonpolluted areas in Japan , we showed that a dose-response relationship existed between renal effects and Cd exposure in the general environment without any known Cd pollution .	
16436274-2	However , we could not estimate the threshold levels of urinary Cd at that time .	
16436274-3	In the present study , we estimated the threshold levels of urinary Cd as the benchmark dose low ( BMDL ) using the benchmark dose ( BMD ) approach .	1 12 127
16436274-4	Urinary Cd excretion was divided into 10 categories , and an abnormality rate was calculated for each .	1 12 127
16436274-5	Cut-off values for urinary substances were defined as corresponding to the 84% and 95% upper limit values of the target population who have not smoked .	
16436274-6	Then we calculated the BMD and BMDL using a log-logistic model .	
16436274-7	The values of BMD and BMDL for all urinary substances could be calculated .	
16436274-8	The BMDL for the 84% cut-off value of beta2-MG , setting an abnormal value at 5% , was 2.4 microg/g creatinine ( cr ) in men and 3.3 microg/g cr in women .	
16436274-9	In conclusion , the present study demonstrated that the threshold level of urinary Cd could be estimated in people living in the general environment without any known Cd-pollution in Japan , and the value was inferred to be almost the same as that in Belgium , Sweden , and China .	
16442149-0	The aim of this study was to assess the total concentration and health risk to infants of breast milk mercury in urban mothers and mothers married to fishermen in relation to fish intake in Taiwan .	24 2 243
16442149-1	A total of sixty-eight healthy mothers were recruited for the study .	
16442149-2	The breast milk mercury geometric mean concentration was 2.02 microgl(-1) ( n=56 , range : 0.24-9.45 microgl(-1) ) for the city group and 2.04 microgl(-1) ( n=12 , range : 0.26-8.62 microgl(-1) ) for the fishermen's group .	1 12 124
16442149-3	Of the three sources of mercury exposure ( i.e. , ingestion ( breast milk ) , inhalation ( ambient air ) , and dermal exposure ( shower) ) , breast-feeding was found to be the largest ( 96.3-99.6% of the total ) .	24 2 243 22 23
16442149-4	From a Monte Carlo simulation , in which methyl mercury accounted for about 50% of total mercury , the hazard quotient ( exposure estimate/oral minimal risk level or target organ toxicity dose ) exceeded 1.0 for 12.9% of urban babies and 18.8% of fishermen's babies ( chronic oral minimal risk level and target organ toxicity dose : 3 x 10(-4)mgkg(-1)d(-1) ) .	
16442149-5	The calculated mercury exposure was 3.02 x 10(-1) microgkg(-1)d(-1) for a 3.49 kg urban baby boy and 3.06 x 10(-1) microgkg(-1)d(-1) for a 3.44 kg urban baby girl .	2
16442149-6	These results suggest the life style of mothers ( eating raw fish and shellfish such as used in " Sashimi " and " Sushi, " and vitamin supplementation ) may influence the mercury concentration in breast milk .	1 12 124
16451850-0	INTRODUCTION Asians , Pacific Islanders , and Native Americans are a potentially high-risk group for dietary exposure to methylmercury through fish consumption .	
16451850-1	However , blood mercury levels in this group have not been identified in recent reports of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) for the years 1999-2002 .	
16451850-2	METHODS We used NHANES data from 1999-2002 to obtain population estimates of blood mercury levels among women of childbearing age classified as belonging to the " other " racial/ethnic group ( Asian , Pacific Islander , Native American , and multiracial ; n = 140 ) .	1 122 12
16451850-3	Blood mercury levels in this group were compared with those among all other women participants , classified as Mexican American , non-Hispanic black , non-Hispanic white , and " other " Hispanic .	1 122 12
16451850-4	RESULTS An estimated 16.59 +/- 4.0% ( mean +/- SE ) of adult female participants who self-identified as Asian , Pacific Islander , Native American , or multiracial ( n = 140 ) had blood mercury levels &gt ; or = 5.8 microg/L , and 27.26 +/- 4.22% had levels &gt ; or = 3.5 microg/L .	1 122 12
16451850-5	Among remaining survey participants ( n = 3,497 ) , 5.08 +/- 0.90% had blood mercury levels &gt ; or = 5.8 microg/L , and 10.86 +/- 1.45% had levels &gt ; or = 3.5 microg/L .	
16451850-6	CONCLUSIONS Study subjects in NHANES who self-identified as Asian , Pacific Islander , Native American , or multiracial had a higher prevalence of elevated blood mercury than all other racial/ethnic participants in the survey .	
16451850-7	Future studies should address reasons for the high mercury levels in this group and explore possible interventions for lowering risk of methylmercury exposure in this population .	
16451851-0	The aim of the present study was to model apparent serum half-lives of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) with 7-10 bromine substituents .	
16451851-1	Workers with occupational exposure to PBDEs have elevated serum levels of PBDEs , but these substances are also found in the general population and are ubiquitous environmental contaminants .	
16451851-2	The calculations were based on exposure assessments of rubber workers ( manufactured flame-retarded rubber compound ) and electronics dismantlers who donated blood during a period with no work-related exposures to PBDEs , and referents without any known occupational exposure ( clerks , cleaners , and abattoir workers ) .	1 122 12
16451851-3	The workers had previously been found to have elevated levels of high- and medium-brominated diphenyl ethers compared with the referent populations .	
16451851-4	We performed nonlinear mixed-effects modeling of kinetics , using data from previous and present chemical analyses .	
16451851-5	The calculated apparent half-life for decabromodiphenyl ether ( BDE-209 ) was 15 days ( 95% confidence interval , 11-18 days ) .	
16451851-6	The three nona-BDEs and four octa-BDE congeners were found to have half-lives of 18-39 and 37-91 days , respectively .	
16451851-7	BDE-209 has a short half-life in human blood .	
16451851-8	Because BDE-209 is commonly present in humans in general , the results of this study imply that humans must be more or less continuously exposed to BDE-209 to sustain the serum concentrations observed .	1 122 12
16451851-9	BDE-209 is more readily transformed and/or eliminated than are lower brominated diphenyl ether congeners , and human health risk must be assessed accordingly .	
15833289-0	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , as a specific group of brominated flame retardants ( BFR ) , are used in a variety of consumer products including electronics and household furnishings .	
15833289-1	In recent years , a marked increase in the levels of PBDEs in human biological tissues and fluids , especially breast milk , has been reported in several countries .	
15833289-2	However , few data are available from countries in the Asia-pacific region , including Singapore .	
15833289-3	This study presents a validated method procedure and the first available data of the concentrations of PBDE congeners : PBDE-47 ( 2,2,4,4-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether ) , PBDE-99 ( 2,2',4,4',5-Pentabromodiphenyl ether ) , PBDE-100 ( 2,2',4,4',6-Pentabromodiphenyl ether ) , PBDE-153 ( 2,2',4,4',5,5'-Hexabromodiphenyl ether ) , PBDE-154 ( 2,2',4,4',5,6'-Hexabromodiphenyl ether ) in maternal adipose tissue collected from inhabitants of Singapore .	1 121 12
15833289-4	Microwave-assisted extraction ( MAE ) of PBDEs spiked adipose tissues coupled with GC-MS analysis achieved comparable recoveries to a conventional Soxhlet Extraction ( SE ) procedure of between 70 and 130% .	1 121 12
15833289-5	MAE also yielded comparable precision data ( variance less than 13% ) relative to the SE procedure .	
15833289-6	Spiked Carbon-13 PBDE congeners were also used as surrogates for MAE quality assurance and confirmed the efficiency of the procedure .	
15833289-7	PBDE congeners were detected in all of 16 maternal adipose tissues collected in Singapore , where levels were comparable to available data from Belgium .	1 121 12
16307791-0	To assess how the human exposure to environmental carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) pollution sources generated from industrial , traffic and rural settings , we present a probabilistic risk model , appraised with reported empirical data .	
16307791-1	A probabilistic risk assessment framework is integrated with the potency equivalence factors ( PEFs ) , age group-specific occupancy probability and the incremental lifetime cancer risk ( ILCR ) approaches to quantitatively estimate the exposure risk for three age groups of adults , children , and infants .	2 22
16307791-2	The benzo[a]pyrene equivalents based PAH concentrations in rural , traffic , and industrial areas associated with age group-specific occupancy probability at different environmental settings are used to calculate daily exposure level through inhalation and dermal contact pathways .	2 22 23
16307791-3	Risk analysis indicates that the inhalation-ILCR and dermal contact-ILCR values for adults follow a lognormal distribution with geometric mean 1.04x10(-4) and 3.85x10(-5) and geometric standard deviation 2.10 and 2.75 , respectively , indicating high potential cancer risk ; whereas for the infants the risk values are less than 10(-6) , indicating no significant cancer risk .	
16307791-4	Sensitivity analysis indicates that the input variables of cancer slope factor and daily inhalation exposure level have the greater impact than that of body weight on the inhalation-ILCR ; whereas for the dermal-ILCR , particle-bound PAH-to-skin adherence factor and daily dermal exposure level have the significant influence than that of body weight .	2 22 23
21982037-0	BACKGROUND Studies on the association of maternal exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) with decreased birth weight in humans have produced conflicting results .	
21982037-1	In Japan in 1968 , an accidental human exposure to rice oil contaminated with PCDDs , PCDFs , and PCBs , led to the development of Yusho disease .	
21982037-2	OBJECTIVE The Yusho cohort was used to evaluate the effect of maternal exposure to PCDDs , PCDFs , and PCBs on birth weight .	
21982037-3	METHODS Blood samples , obtained from 101 Yusho women ( 190 births ) who gave birth after exposure , were analyzed for congeners of seven PCDDs , ten PCDFs , and four non-ortho PCBs .	1 122 12
21982037-4	RESULTS Total PCDD TEQ ( adjusted beta=-161.9g ; 95% CI , -265.3 to -58.6 ) , total PCDF TEQ ( adjusted beta=-105.9g ; 95% CI , -179.5 to -32.2 ) , and total non-ortho PCBs ( adjusted beta=-178.4g ; 95% CI , -318.3 to -38.5 ) levels were inversely associated with birth weight .	1 11 112
21982037-5	Significant inverse associations with birth weight were also found for total PCDD TEQ , total PCDF TEQ , and total non-ortho PCB TEQ levels among male , but not female , infants .	
21982037-6	Significant inverse associations with birth weight were also found for nine congeners among all infants ; the adjusted beta coefficients were largest for 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD and smallest for 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF .	
21982037-7	CONCLUSION In the setting of exposure to high levels of dioxins , maternal blood levels of PCDDs , PCDFs and PCBs are associated with lower birth weight in Yusho patients .	1 122 12
21982037-8	The association exhibited gender-specific differences , as male infants are more susceptible than females to growth restriction induced by in utero dioxin exposures .	
16293284-0	To assess how the human exposure to airborne carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) during working in or visiting a typical Taiwanese temple , we present a probabilistic risk model , appraised with reported empirical data .	
16293284-1	Two approaches are applied , one based on animal-derived benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) toxic equivalents ( B[a]P(eq) ) of individual PAHs and one is assumed that the potency of PAH mixtures is linked to their B[a]P level .	
16293284-2	The model integrates probabilistic exposure profiles of total-PAH and particle-bound PAH levels inside a temple from a published exploratory study with probabilistic incremental lifetime cancer risk ( ILCR ) models taking into account inhalation and dermal contact pathways , to quantitatively estimate the exposure risks for three age groups of adult , adolescent , and child .	2 22 23
16293284-3	Risk analysis indicates that 90% probability inhalation ILCRs for three age groups have orders of magnitude around 10(-7)--10(-6) ; whereas for the dermal contact ILCRs ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-4) , indicating high potential cancer risk .	
16293284-4	All 90% probabilities of B[a]P- and B[a]P(eq)-based total ILCRs are larger than 10(-6) , indicating unacceptable probability distributions for three age groups .	
16293284-5	Sensitivity analysis indicates that to increase the accuracy of the results efforts should focus on a better definition of probability distributions for inhalation cancer slope factor , inhalation rates , and particle-bound PAH-to-skin adherence factor .	
16293284-6	We estimate risk-based visiting frequency advice for adult , adolescent , and child to a temple ranging from 5 to 7 , 17 to 23 , and 48 to 65 year(-1) , respectively , based on an average 3h residence time .	
21979175-0	The current study examines whether the occupation of firefighting contributes to exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .	
21979175-1	We compared serum dioxin concentrations and congener profiles of current firefighters ( n=13 ) with those of men who have ceased employment as firefighters ( n=17 ) and with men employed in occupations other than firefighter ( n=10 ) .	1 122 12
21979175-2	We found that compared to former or non-firefighters , current firefighters have higher levels of dioxins primarily due to the contribution of PCBs and to a lesser extent PCDFs .	
21979175-3	PCDFs were significantly higher in former firefighters compared to non-firefighters ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
21979175-4	Comparisons with studies performed by other investigators suggest that local environmental conditions contribute to some of the elevation of PCBs .	
21979175-5	The congeners 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzodioxin and PCB-114 were significantly higher in current firefighters when compared to former or non-firefighters .	
21979175-6	Moreover , levels of these congeners were inversely correlated with years since employed as firefighter ( Spearman r=-0.610 , p=0.009 and Spearman r=-0.53 , p=0.03 , respectively ) .	
21979175-7	The classes of dioxins show an overall decline with years since employed as firefighters , this decline is most evident with PCDDs ( Spearman r=-0.46 , p=0.06 ) .	
21979175-8	Together , the combination of evidence supports firefighting as a source of exposure to dioxins .	
15866469-0	Research has shown that workers employed in footwear manufacture are at increased risk of some cancers , the strongest evidence being for nasal cancer and leukemia .	
15866469-1	Footwear-workers are routinely exposed to complex mixtures of solvents in degreasers , cleaners , primers , and adhesives used in the production process as toluene , n-hexane , acetone , and possibly dust particles , additives in shoe materials and degradation products of materials .	
15866469-2	The recognition of the potential health-hazards of solvent-based adhesives ( SBAs ) has lead to the development of adhesives with no organic solvents , the water-based adhesives ( WBA ) .	
15866469-3	We investigated footwear-workers ( all males ) exposed to SBA ( n=29 ) ( for 3.98+/-4.13 years ) , and WBA ( n=16 ) , which had spent the six months previous to the study employed in an experimental section which used only water-based adhesives , although they had previously worked in sections which used solvent-based adhesives ( for 5.80+/-4.03 years ) ; 25 healthy subjects were used as controls .	1 12 127
15866469-4	The Comet assay and the micronucleus test were used as endpoints , while the traditional parameters for assessing exposure to toluene in organic mixtures by measuring the concentration of urinary hippuric acid were also assessed .	11 1111 12 1 111 127
15866469-5	Our results showed a significantly lower mean concentration of hippuric acid in the control group than found in the SBA ( P&lt;0.001 ) and WBA ( P&lt;0.05 ) groups .	
15866469-6	The Comet assay results showed that there was a significant increase in the mean damage index for the SBA ( P&lt;0.001 ) group in comparison to the WBA group and control ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
15866469-7	For the micronucleus test in binucleated lymphocytes and exfoliated buccal cell , the three groups were not statistically different .	
15866469-8	Our study demonstrated that water-based adhesives are clearly a better option for safeguarding the health of footwear-workers , even with possibility of isocyanate presence , while the positive results observed in SBA group might be explained by chloroprene presence in the adhesive .	
15868449-0	OBJECTIVE Arsenic exposure and environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) have been suspected to be associated with bladder cancer risk .	
15868449-1	We hypothesize that interaction between ETS and the ability to methylate arsenic , a detoxification pathway , modifies the risk of bladder cancer .	
15868449-2	METHODS From January 1996 to December 1999 , we identified 41 newly diagnosed bladder cancer patients and 202 fracture and cataract patients at the National Cheng-Kung University ( NCKU ) Medical Center .	
15868449-3	The levels of urinary arsenic species [ As(III) , As(V) , MMA(V) , and DMA(V) ] were determined in all subjects .	1 12 127
15868449-4	RESULTS We found significant interaction between ETS and secondary methylation index ( SMI ) on the risk of bladder cancer ( p=0.02 ) .	
15868449-5	Among non-smokers with a high primary methylation index ( PMI ) , the risk of bladder cancer was lower in subjects exposed to ETS ( OR , 0.37 ; 95% CI , 0.14-0.96 ) than in subjects without exposure to ETS .	
15868449-6	Among non-smokers without ETS , the risk of bladder cancer was 4.7 times higher in subjects with a low SMI ( 95% CI , 1.30-16.81 ) than in subjects with a high SMI .	
15868449-7	CONCLUSIONS Ability to methylate arsenic plays an important role in reducing the risk of bladder cancer attributable to the continuation of arsenic exposure from drinking water and from ETS exposure .	
16242869-0	Organophosphates , used in agriculture , are readily absorbed through the skin .	
16242869-1	We investigated the relationship between dermal and inhalative methyl parathion exposure and the plasma levels .	12 22 23 1 122 2
16242869-2	Twenty-three healthy wine growers sprayed the insecticide for 50 min .	
16242869-3	Fluorescent brilliant sulfoflavin was added to the spraying fluids and filter papers were fixed on the subjects .	
16242869-4	The filter papers were used to evaluate the amount of brilliant sulfoflavine on the unprotected skin fluorometrically .	
16242869-5	Inhalative exposure was measured with personal air sampler .	2 233 23
16242869-6	Plasma concentrations of methyl parathion and its metabolite methyl paraoxon were determined with gas chromatography .	1 122 12
16242869-7	Cholinesterase activity in serum and erythrocytes was measured before and after exposure .	11 1 11123 111 1112
16242869-8	Some wine growers wore protective clothes , none protective gloves .	
16242869-9	Dermal exposure ranged up to 12,044 microg , inhalative to 22 microg .	2 22
16242869-10	Maximum plasma concentration of methyl parathion was 12.1 microg/l .	
16242869-11	Methyl paraoxon was not detectable .	
16242869-12	Cholinesterase activity did not decrease .	
16242869-13	Dermal exposure correlated with the methyl parathion plasma level ( Spearman's rho=0.72 , p&lt;0.001 ) .	2 22
16242869-14	In conclusion , dermal exposure exceeded inhalative exposure considerably .	2 22 23
16242869-15	Measuring dermal deposition with the brilliant sulfoflavin technique may provide a good estimate of the internal load with methyl parathion .	2 22
16242869-16	Preventive measures should be improved as toxic effects of repeated exposure to low doses of methyl parathion cannot be excluded .	
21968334-0	Human biomonitoring is a well-recognized tool for estimating the exposure of human populations to environmental pollutants .	
21968334-1	However , information regarding biomarker concentrations of many environmental chemicals in the general population is limited for many countries .	
21968334-2	The Spanish Environment Ministry has recently funded a human biomonitoring study on the Spanish general population .	
21968334-3	This study aims to determine reference levels for several biomarkers , especially heavy metals , persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) and cotinine , in urine , whole blood , serum and hair , and will involve 2000 volunteers throughout Spain .	
21968334-4	Samples were taken during 2009-2010 and analyses are currently underway .	
21968334-5	The results presented herein were obtained in a pilot study carried out in the Madrid region .	
21968334-6	The study group comprised 170 volunteers , of which 79% were female and 21% male ( age : 23-66 years ) .	
21968334-7	All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding diet and living habits and provides a morning urine sample .	24 12 1 2 243 127
21968334-8	The geometric means for total mercury ( Hg ) , lead ( Pb ) and cadmium ( Cd ) were 1.23 , 1.11 and 0.25 Î¼g/g creatinine , respectively .	
21968334-9	Levels of Pb and Hg were higher than those reported for the general population in the USA and Germany , whereas Cd was in the same range ( CDC , 2009 ; Becker et al. , 2003 ) .	
21968334-10	The values reported here are similar to those reported in other Spanish studies .	
21962832-0	BACKGROUND Little is known about the variation in exposure to toxic metals by age and gender and other potential modifying factors .	
21962832-1	We evaluated age and gender differences by measurements of metal/element concentrations in urine in a rural population in Matlab , Bangladesh , in three age groups : 8-12 ( N=238 ) , 14-15 ( N=107 ) and 30-88 ( N=710 ) years of age , living in an area with no point sources of metal exposure but where elevated water arsenic concentrations are prevalent .	1 12 127
21962832-2	RESULTS We found marked differences in urine concentrations of metals and trace elements by gender , age , tobacco use , socioeconomic and nutritional status .	1 12 127
21962832-3	Besides a clearly elevated urinary arsenic concentration in all age groups ( medians 63-85 Î¼g As/L ) , and despite the low degree of contamination from industries and traffic , the urine concentrations of toxic metals such as cadmium and lead were clearly elevated , especially in children ( median 0.31 Î¼g Cd/L and 2.9 Î¼g Pb/L , respectively ) .	1 12 127
21962832-4	In general , women had higher urinary concentrations of toxic metals , especially Cd ( median 0.81 Î¼g/L ) compared to men ( 0.66 Î¼g/L ) and U ( median 10 ng/L in women , compared to 6.4 ng/L in men ) , while men had higher urinary concentrations of the basic and essential elements Ca ( 69 mg/L in men , 30-50 years , compared to 52 mg/L in women ) , Mg ( 58 mg/L in men compared to 50 mg/L in women ) , Zn ( 182 Î¼g/L in men compared to 117 Î¼g/L in women ) and Se ( 9.9 Î¼g/L in men compared to 8.7 Î¼g/L in women ) .	
21962832-5	Manganese was consistently higher in females than in males in all age groups , suggesting a biological difference between females and males in Mn metabolism .	
21962832-6	Increasing socioeconomic status decreased the toxic metal exposure significantly in children and especially in men .	
21962832-7	Poor iron status was detected in 17% of children , adolescents and women , but only in 6% of men .	
21962832-8	Also zinc deficiency was more prevalent in females than in males .	
21962832-9	CONCLUSIONS Women and children seemed to be more at risk for toxic metal exposure than men and at the same time more vulnerable to micronutrient deficiency .	
21962832-10	Higher concentrations of the toxic metals in urine in women are likely to reflect an increased gastrointestinal absorption of these metals at micronutrient deficiency , such as low body iron stores and Zn deficiency .	
21962832-11	Higher urinary concentrations of the essential elements in men likely reflect a better nutritional status .	
21962832-12	There is a need for information on exposure , lifestyle and socioeconomic factors , stratified by gender and age , for the purpose of conducting balanced risk assessment and management that considers such differences .	
16474266-0	OBJECTIVE Many drugs are vestibulotoxic and may impair balance .	
16474266-1	Styrene is both ototoxic and neurotoxic , but its effect on balance has been little studied .	
16474266-2	We evaluate the effect of low concentrations of styrene on balance among Finnish fiberglass-reinforced plastic boat manufacturers .	
16474266-3	METHODS From 252 male employees , we measured postural stability and urine mandelic and phenylglycolic acid concentrations .	11 1 127 12 112
16474266-4	Individual exposure to styrene in breathing zone was measured for 148 workers .	12 23 1 2 127 233
16474266-5	For analysis , 88 matched pairs were selected .	
16474266-6	RESULTS The postural stability of laminators was aggravated compared with nonlaminators .	
16474266-7	This impairment was observed in young workers , and it worsened with age .	
16474266-8	CONCLUSIONS This study documents styrene as an additional risk factor in impaired postural stability , with the negative effects of the styrene exposure starting already in younger workers .	
16002374-0	Individual exposure to trihalomethanes ( THMs ) in tap water can occur through ingestion , inhalation , or dermal exposure .	
16002374-1	Studies indicate that activities associated with inhaled or dermal exposure routes result in a greater increase in blood THM concentration than does ingestion .	2 22 23
16002374-2	We measured blood and exhaled air concentrations of THM as biomarkers of exposure to participants conducting 14 common household water use activities , including ingestion of hot and cold tap water beverages , showering , clothes washing , hand washing , bathing , dish washing , and indirect shower exposure .	24 12 1 122 2 241 125
16002374-3	We conducted our study at a single residence in each of two water utility service areas , one with relatively high and the other low total THM in the residence tap water .	24 2 241
16002374-4	To maintain a consistent exposure environment for seven participants , we controlled water use activities , exposure time , air exchange , water flow and temperature , and nonstudy THM sources to the indoor air .	
16002374-5	We collected reference samples for water supply and air ( pre-water use activity ) , as well as tap water and ambient air samples .	2 232 23
16002374-6	We collected blood samples before and after each activity and exhaled breath samples at baseline and post-activity .	1 122 12 125
16002374-7	All hot water use activities yielded a 2-fold increase in blood or breath THM concentrations for at least one individual .	
16002374-8	The greatest observed increase in blood and exhaled breath THM concentration in any participant was due to showering ( direct and indirect ) , bathing , and hand dishwashing .	
16002374-9	Average increase in blood THM concentration ranged from 57 to 358 pg/mL due to these activities .	
16002374-10	More research is needed to determine whether acute and frequent exposures to THM at these concentrations have public health implications .	
16002374-11	Further research is also needed in designing epidemiologic studies that minimize data collection burden yet maximize accuracy in classification of dermal and inhalation THM exposure during hot water use activities .	2 22 23
21962593-0	The goal of the study was to test the hypothesis that prenatal Paracetamol exposure increases the risk of developing eczema in early childhood and that this association may be stronger in children who are exposed in fetal period to higher concentrations of fine particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) .	
21962593-1	The study sample consisted of 322 women recruited from January 2001 to February 2004 in the Krakow inner city area who gave birth to term babies and completed 5-year follow-up .	
21962593-2	Paracetamol use in pregnancy was collected by interviews and prenatal personal exposure to PM2.5 over 48 h was measured in recruited women in the second trimester of pregnancy .	23 2 233
21962593-3	After delivery , every three months in the first 24 months of the newborn's life and every 6 months later , a detailed standardized face-to-face interview on the infant's health was administered to each mother by trained interviewers .	
21962593-4	During the interviews at each of the study periods after birth , a history of eczema was recorded .	
21962593-5	The incident rate ratio ( IRR ) for frequency of eczema events over the follow-up was estimated from the Poisson regression model and the overall effect of main exposure variables on eczema was assessed by odds ratios ( ORs ) by the logistic model .	
21962593-6	The estimated relative risk of eczema occurring whenever in the follow-up was related significantly neither with prenatal Paracetamol nor higher PM2.5 exposure , however , their joint effect was significant ( OR interaction term=6.04 ; 95%CI : 1.04-35.16 ) .	
21962593-7	Of potential confounders considered in the analysis only damp/moldy home significantly increased the risk of eczema ( OR=1.53 ; 95%CI : 1.14-2.05 ) .	
21962593-8	In contrast , there was an inverse significant association between the presence of older siblings and eczema ( OR=0.55 ; 95%CI : 0.35-0.84 ) .	
21962593-9	The joint effect of the main exposure variables significantly increased frequency of eczema events ( IRR=1.78 , 95%CI : 1.22-2.61 ) .	
21962593-10	In conclusion , the findings of the study suggest that Paracetamol use by mothers in pregnancy is not an independent risk factor for eczema in children , however , even very small doses of Paracetamol taken in pregnancy may contribute to the occurrence of allergic symptoms in early childhood if there is prenatal co-exposure to higher airborne fine particulate matter .	
15926941-0	UNLABELLED Children spend increasing time indoors .	
15926941-1	Exposure to environmental factors may contribute to the development or exacerbation of the asthmatic phenotype .	
15926941-2	Inter-relationships between these factors might influence the manifestation of asthma .	
15926941-3	Endotoxin exposure has been shown to have pro-inflammatory and protective effects in different situations .	
15926941-4	We investigated the exposure to several indoor pollutants ( endotoxin , Der p 1 , damp , ETS , PM2.5 ) in asthmatic and healthy children .	
15926941-5	The children were recruited from two primary care centers according to their response to a validated questionnaire .	
15926941-6	Asthmatic children were matched for sex , age and sib-ship size with children living in asthma free households .	
15926941-7	Of 90 matched pairs , higher levels of endotoxin were found in the living room carpets , but not the bedroom carpet or mattresses of the asthma compared with the control homes ( STATA analysis OR : 1.88 ( 1.11-3.18 ) ; P=0.018 ) .	24 2 242
15926941-8	Asthmatic children were also more likely to live as part of a single parent family , in a house where the parents self-reported the presence of damp , and where the living room had been redecorated in the 12 months prior to the sampling visits .	
15926941-9	This study suggests that endotoxin in urban homes is a risk factor for the development of asthma .	
15926941-10	Moreover , this study found that there were no statistically significant interactions between environmental factors .	
15926941-11	PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS This study has demonstrated that the home environments of English children ( 4-17 ) with asthma and without the disease do not differ greatly .	24 2 242
15926941-12	With the exception of endotoxin , the parameters examined in this study , including house dust mite allergens , nitrogen dioxide , ETS and damp are unlikely to be related to the development of asthma .	24 2 242
15926941-13	Avoidance of these pollutants may not be beneficial in preventing asthma in this age group .	
15964612-0	Historically , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) was used in northern Thailand for malaria control and farming purposes .	
15964612-1	Several studies have investigated its effects on end points of adverse reproductive health outcomes .	
15964612-2	However , the few previous studies investigated hormonal effects in men and available data are inconclusive .	
15964612-3	The authors aimed to explore the main hypothesis that plasma DDT levels in adult men were associated with reproductive hormone levels .	11 12 1 122 1112 111
15964612-4	A cross-sectional study was performed of 97 adult men living in a highland village named Mae Sa Mai , 35 km north of Chiang Mai , Thailand .	
15964612-5	Venous blood samples were collected for measuring plasma levels of DDT and its metabolites and reproductive hormones , including 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) , testosterone , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH). 1,1-Dichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethane ( p,p'-DDT ) were detected in all plasma samples. p,p'-DDE had the highest level with a median of 4057.7 ng/g lipids and a relatively higher level compared with most other studies .	11 12 1 11121 122 1112 111 11123
15964612-6	Plasma p,p'-DDT levels were positively associated with years of residence ( beta+SE=0.472+0.208 , P=0.028 ) and years of DDT usage for farming ( beta+SE=0.177+0.084 , P=0.04 ) .	
15964612-7	The remarkable findings were the negative association of plasma E2 levels with plasma p,p'-DDE levels ( beta+SE=-7.093+2.899 , P=0.016 ) and the positive association with plasma 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophynyl)ethylene ( o,p'-DDE ) levels ( beta+SE=16.381+5.596 , P=0.008 ) after adjusting for age and body mass index ( BMI ) .	
15964612-8	However , these associations were rather weak .	
15964612-9	Our results suggest that these associations may reflect their different mechanisms of hormonal activities and they would be warrant further detail investigations .	
15930591-0	The objective of this study was to establish the potential relationship between the levels of various metals in hair and cognitive functions in children living in zones of Tarragona ( Catalonia , Spain ) with different metal pollution levels .	11 1 123 12 112
15930591-1	Thirty-nine boys and 61 girls ( 12-14 yr old ) from various schools were selected for the study .	
15930591-2	The concentrations of cadmium ( Cd ) , chromium ( Cr ) , mercury ( Hg ) , lead ( Pb ) , manganese ( Mn ) , nickel ( Ni ) , and tin ( Sn ) in scalp hair were determined by inductively coupled plasma- mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) .	1 123 12
15930591-3	Attention , visuospatial capabilities , and abstract reasoning were assessed as indicators of cognitive impairment .	1 11 112
15930591-4	Three categories of attention were defined : low , medium , and high .	
15930591-5	A significant negative correlation ( p=0.019 ) between Pb levels in hair and attention was observed .	1 123 12
15930591-6	Significant differences between Pb levels in hair in low- and medium-performance groups and those in the high-performance group were also found .	
15930591-7	Moreover , a positive correlation ( p=0.048 ) between Hg hair concentrations and visuospatial capabilities was also noted .	1 123 12
16484446-0	Homocysteine levels are associated with peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) in observational studies .	
16484446-1	Lead and cadmium are risk factors for PAD that affect thiol metabolism , and they may partly explain the association of homocysteine with PAD .	
16484446-2	To evaluate the roles of lead and cadmium exposure in confounding the association between homocysteine and PAD , the authors performed a cross-sectional study among 4,447 persons aged &gt ; or = 40 years who participated in the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) .	
16484446-3	PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial blood pressure index less than 0.90 in at least one leg .	
16484446-4	After adjustment for sociodemographic variables , the odds ratio for PAD in the highest quintile of homocysteine compared with the lowest was 1.92 ( p(trend) = 0.004 ) .	11 1 11122 1112 111
16484446-5	Adjusting for blood lead and cadmium levels reduced this odds ratio to 1.37 ( p(trend) = 0.13 ) , and further adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate and smoking reduced it to 0.89 ( p(trend) = 0.87 ) .	1 122 12
16484446-6	Adjustment for other risk factors did not affect this association .	
16484446-7	In the general population , the association of homocysteine level with PAD can be completely explained by confounding due to smoking , increased blood lead and cadmium levels , and impaired renal function .	
16484446-8	The association of lead and cadmium with PAD risk deserves further investigation .	
21949980-0	Arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxin with known neurological consequences .	
21949980-1	Few studies , however , have investigated groundwater arsenic concentrations and cognition among adults and elders .	
21949980-2	In the study described in this article , the authors examined the potential link between cognitive functioning and low concentrations of arsenic in drinking water .	11 24 1 2 241 112
21949980-3	Arsenic concentrations were estimated by the Geographic Information System approach ( GIS-arsenic ) for 299 rural-dwelling adults and elders .	24 2 241
21949980-4	Cognition was assessed with Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .	1 11 112
21949980-5	Those in the relatively high GIS-arsenic exposure ( &gt ; 10.0 microg/L ) group had significantly lower MMSE scores than those in the low GIS-arsenic exposure ( &lt ; or = 10.0 microg/L ) group ( p &lt ; .03 ) .	
21949980-6	The number of years of education was significantly lower in those in the high GIS-arsenic group(s) than in those in the low GIS-arsenic group ( p &lt ; .05 ) .	
21949980-7	These results suggest that poorer cognitive functioning and lower education levels were associated with higher ( though still low-level ) GIS-arsenic levels in this rural adult cohort .	
15794462-0	This paper reports on a study of indoor air quality in homes and child care facilities in non-metropolitan counties of New York State .	2 232 23
15794462-1	Specific pollutants examined were lead , radon , carbon monoxide , asbestos , and mold .	
15794462-2	Some homes had high levels of pollutants , and certain pollutants were significantly and negatively correlated with household income .	
15794462-3	High levels of pollutants also were observed in many child care facilities , which raises questions about constant exposure of children to pollutants .	
15794462-4	Recommendations are made for lowering pollutant levels in low-income households and child care facilities .	
15935801-0	Benzene has been used in various industries as glues or solvents in Korea .	
15935801-1	Since 1981 , a preparation containing more than 1% benzene is not allowed to be manufactured , used or dealt with in the workplace , except in laboratories and in those situations benzene must be used in a completely sealed process as specified in Industrial Safety and Health Act ( ISHA ) .	
15935801-2	Claims for compensation of hematopoietic diseases related to benzene have been rising even though the work environment has been improved .	
15935801-3	This study was conducted to assess the status of benzene exposure in different industries in Korea .	
15935801-4	We reviewed the claimed cases investigated by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency ( KOSHA ) between 1992 and 2000 .	
15935801-5	The Survey of National Work Environment Status in 1998 was analyzed to assume the number of workers and factories exposed to benzene .	
15935801-6	In 2000 , six factories were investigated to evaluate benzene exposure .	
15935801-7	Personal air monitoring was performed in 61 workers and urine samples were collected from 57 workers to measure trans,trans-muconic acid ( t,t-MA ) .	12 23 1 2 127 233
15935801-8	Hematologic examination has performed .	
15935801-9	Thirty-four cases of hematopoietic diseases were investigated by KOSHA including eight cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and eight cases of acute myelocytic leukemia .	
15935801-10	Eight cases were accepted as related to benzene exposure .	
15935801-11	The number of workers possibly exposed to benzene can be estimated to be 196,182 workers from 6219 factories based on the database .	
15935801-12	The geometric mean of benzene in air was 0.094 ( 0.005-5.311 ) ppm .	
15935801-13	Seven samples were higher than 1 ppm but they did not go over the 10 ppm occupational exposure limit ( OEL ) value in Korea .	
15935801-14	The geometric mean of trans,trans-muconic acid in urine was 0.966 ( 0.24-2.74 ) mg/g creatinine .	1 12 127
15935801-15	The benzene exposure level was low except in a factory where benzene was used to polymerize other chemicals .	
15935801-16	The ambient benzene from 0.1 to 1 ppm was significantly correlated with urine t,t-MA concentration ( r=0.733 , p&lt;0.01 ) .	
15935801-17	Hematologic parameters did not show significant difference among groups divided into the level of exposure .	
15935801-18	Korean workers were not highly exposed to benzene and the level of exposure was mostly less than 1 ppm .	
15935801-19	However , there might be an excessive risk of hematopoietic disorders due to relatively high past exposure .	
15935801-20	The OEL value of benzene was amended to 1 ppm from 10 ppm in 2002 and was effective since July 2003 .	
16504071-0	BACKGROUND The UK government proposed introducing partial smokefree legislation for England with exemptions for pubs and bars that do not prepare and serve food .	
16504071-1	We set out to test the hypothesis that pubs from more deprived areas and non food-serving pubs have higher levels of particulate air pollution .	
16504071-2	METHODS We conducted a cross sectional study in four mainly urban areas of the North West of England .	
16504071-3	We recruited a stratified random sample of 64 pubs divided into four groups based on whether their local population was affluent or deprived ( using a UK area based deprivation measure ) , and whether or not they served food .	
16504071-4	The timing of air quality monitoring stratified to ensure similar distribution of monitoring by day of the week and time of evening between groups .	
16504071-5	We used a portable air quality monitor to collect fine particle ( PM2.5 ) levels over a minimum of 30 minutes in areas where smoking was allowed, , and calculated mean time-time weighted average PM2.5 levels .	2 232 23
16504071-6	RESULTS Mean PM2.5 was 285.5 microg/m3 ( 95% CI 212.7 to 358.3 ) .	
16504071-7	Mean levels in the four groups were : affluent food-serving pubs ( n = 16 ) 188.1 microg/m3 ( 95%CI 128.1 to 248.1 ) ; affluent non food-serving ( n = 16 ) 186.8 microg/m3 ( 95%CI 118.9 to 254.3 ) ; deprived food-serving ( n = 17 ) 399.4 microg/m3 ( 95%CI 177.7 to 621.2 ) ; and deprived non food-serving ( n = 15 ) 365.7 microg/m3 ( 195.6 to 535.7 ) .	2 232 23
16504071-8	Levels were higher in pubs in deprived communities : mean 383.6 microg/m3 ( 95% CI 249.2 to 518.0 ) vs 187.4 microg/m3 ( 144.8 to 229.9 ) ; geometric mean 245.2 microg/m3 vs 151.2 microg/m3 ( p = 0.03 ) .	
16504071-9	There was little difference in particulate levels between food and non food-serving pubs .	
16504071-10	CONCLUSION This study adds to the evidence that the UK government's proposals for partial smokefree legislation in England would offer the least protection to the most heavily exposed group--bar workers and customers in non food-serving pubs in deprived areas .	
16504071-11	The results suggest these proposals would work against the UK government's stated aim to reduce health inequalities .	
16504175-0	BACKGROUND Personal exposure to pollutants is influenced by various outdoor and indoor sources .	
16504175-1	The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure of Athens citizens to toluene and xylene , excluding exposure from active smoking .	
16504175-2	METHODS Passive air samplers were used to monitor volunteers , their homes and various urban sites for one year , resulting in 2400 measurements of toluene and xylene levels .	2 233 23
16504175-3	Since both indoor and outdoor pollution contribute significantly to human exposure , volunteers were chosen from occupational groups who spend a lot of time in the streets ( traffic policemen , bus drivers and postmen ) , and from groups who spend more time indoors ( teachers and students ) .	
16504175-4	Data on individual and house characteristics were obtained using a questionnaire completed at the beginning of the study ; a time-location-activity diary was also completed daily by the volunteers in each of the six monitoring campaigns .	
16504175-5	RESULTS Average personal toluene exposure varied over the six monitoring campaigns from 53 to 80 microg/m3 .	2 233 23
16504175-6	Urban and indoor concentrations ranged from 47-84 microg/m3 and 30 - 51 microg/m3 , respectively .	2 232 23
16504175-7	Average personal xylene exposure varied between 56 and 85 microg/m3 while urban and indoor concentrations ranged from 53-88 microg/m3 and 27-48 microg/m3 , respectively .	2 233 232 23
16504175-8	Urban pollution , indoor residential concentrations and personal exposures exhibited the same pattern of variation during the measurement periods .	2 233 232 23
16504175-9	This variation among monitoring campaigns might largely be explained by differences in climate parameters , namely wind speed , humidity and amount of sunlight .	
16504175-10	CONCLUSION In Athens , Greece , the time spent outdoors in the city center during work or leisure makes a major contribution to exposure to toluene and xylene among non-smoking citizens .	
16504175-11	Indoor pollution and means of transportation contribute significantly to individual exposure levels .	
16504175-12	Other indoor residential characteristics such as recent painting and mode of heating used might also contribute significantly to individual levels .	
16504175-13	Groups who may be subject to higher exposures ( e.g. those who spent more time outdoors because of occupational activities ) need to be surveyed and protected against possible adverse health effects .	
21937271-0	Perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) comprise a large group of man-made fluorinated chemicals used in a number of consumer products and industrial applications .	
21937271-1	PFCs have shown to be persistent , bio-accumulative and widespread in the environment .	
21937271-2	Animal studies have demonstrated hepatotoxicity , immunotoxicity , developmental toxicity as well as hormonal effects .	
21937271-3	We investigated prenatal exposure to several PFCs and detected up to seven different PFCs in 123 paired samples of human maternal and cord blood , from a subcohort of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study ( MoBa ) .	1 122 12
21937271-4	The maternal and foetal levels were significantly correlated for all PFCs tested with median PFC concentrations in cord blood ranging between 30 and 79% of the maternal concentrations , demonstrating placental passage .	1 122 12
21937271-5	The composition of the different PFCs varied between cord and maternal blood , with a higher proportion of shorter chained PFCs together with a higher amount of the branched isomers of perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) in cord blood .	1 122 12
21937271-6	Additionally , the sulfonate group seems to impede transfer efficiency .	
21937271-7	This indicates a selective placental passage of the different PFCs and hence a specific foetal exposure .	
21926918-0	OBJECTIVE The aim of the work is to define occupational exposure to styrene in fiberglass manufacture ; the phase of stretching styrene resins needs some manual handling and leads workers to be exposed to styrene .	
21926918-1	METHODS We surveyed 20 workers in two companies manufacturing fiberglass , checking environmental levels and urinary concentrations of mandelic acid ( MA ) , and phenylglioxylic acid ( PGA ) .	1 12 127
21926918-2	Workers completed a questionnaire collecting their medical history .	
21926918-3	RESULTS Environmental monitoring showed some styrene concentrations higher than the threshold limit value-time-weighted average .	
21926918-4	Biological monitoring confirmed these findings and four workers had levels of urinary PGA and MA concentrations higher than the Biological Exposure Indices of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists .	1 12 127
21926918-5	CONCLUSIONS This picture confirms that , even though the risk is known and the manufacturing cycle is well-defined , workers nevertheless risk exposure .	
21926918-6	More research is needed to optimize the work processes and the protection systems to lower this risk .	
16507456-0	Although oxidative stress has been proposed as a mechanism of lead and cadmium toxicity mostly based on in vitro experiments or animal studies , it is uncertain whether this mechanism is relevant in the pathogenesis of lead- or cadmium-related diseases in the general population with low environmental exposure to lead and cadmium .	
16507456-1	We examined associations of blood lead and urinary cadmium levels with oxidative stress markers of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase ( GGT ) , vitamin C , carotenoids , and vitamin E among 10,098 adult participants in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 1114 127 1112
16507456-2	After adjusting for race , sex , and age ( plus serum total cholesterol in the case of serum carotenoids and vitamin E ) , blood lead and urinary cadmium levels both showed graded associations , positive with serum GGT and inverse with serum vitamin C , carotenoids , and vitamin E ( p for trend &lt ; 0.01 , respectively ) .	
16507456-3	These associations were consistently observed among most subgroups : non-Hispanic white , non-Hispanic black , men , women , all age groups , nondrinkers , drinkers , nonsmokers , ex-smokers , current smokers , and body mass index ( &lt ; 25 , 25-29.9 , and &gt ; or = 30 ) .	
16507456-4	The strong association of blood lead and urinary cadmium levels with oxidative stress markers in this population suggests that oxidative stress should be considered in the pathogenesis of lead- and cadmium-related diseases even among people with low environmental exposure to lead and cadmium .	
15986116-0	OBJECTIVE Several studies have suggested that there is an occupational component to the causation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) .	
15986116-1	We aimed to use accurate means to assess occupational exposures to solvents , metals , organic dusts and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in a case-control study .	
15986116-2	METHODS Cases were incident NHLs during 2000 and 2001 in two regions of Australia .	
15986116-3	Controls were randomly selected from the electoral roll and frequency matched to cases by age , sex and region .	
15986116-4	A detailed occupational history was taken from each subject .	
15986116-5	For jobs with likely exposure to the chemicals of interest , additional questions were asked by telephone interview using modified job specific modules .	
15986116-6	An expert allocated exposures using the information in the job histories and the interviews .	2 21
15986116-7	Odds ratios were calculated for each exposure adjusting for age , sex , region and ethnic origin .	
15986116-8	RESULTS 694 cases and 694 controls ( 70 and 45 respectively of those potentially eligible ) participated .	
15986116-9	The risk of NHL was increased by about 30 for exposure to any solvent with a dose response relationship , subgroup analysis showed the finding was restricted to solvents other than benzene .	
15986116-10	Exposure to wood dust also increased the risk of NHL slightly .	
15986116-11	Exposures to other organic dusts , metals , and PCBs were not strongly related to NHL .	
15986116-12	CONCLUSIONS The risk of NHL appears to be increased by exposure to solvents other than benzene and possibly to wood dust .	
15330389-0	OBJECTIVE This cross-sectional study investigates the cardiovascular effects among Chinese workers who were occupationally exposed to carbon disulfide ( CS2 ) , and evaluates the protective value of the current Chinese Maximum Allowable Concentration ( MAC ) of CS2 against cardiovascular effects .	
15330389-1	METHODS The measurements of exposure were performed by personal sampling and gas chromatography .	2 233 23
15330389-2	The biological monitoring was performed by HPLC .	
15330389-3	Three hundred and sixty-seven exposed workers and 125 reference workers ( never exposed to CS2, ) were included in this study .	2 233 23
15330389-4	The exposed workers were divided into 2 sub-groups according to their cumulative exposure indices , the cut-off point being at 100 which means 10 years exposure to the Chinese Maximum Allowable Concentration in the workplace ( 10 mg/m3 ) .	
15330389-5	All subjects were examined using a self-administered questionnaire including medical and job history , clinical complaints in the previous three months , and underwent a clinical check-up and a 12 lead electrocardiography ( ECG ) at rest , coded according to the Minnesota code .	
15330389-6	Blood pressure ( BP ) was recorded and blood samples were collected for lipid measurements .	11 1 11121 1112 111 112
15330389-7	RESULTS The personal monitoring showed that the exposures levels ( 15.47 +/- 2.34 mg/m3 ) were below the Threshold Limit Value ( TLV , 31 mg/m3 ) , and most of the samples analyzed still showed higher values than the Chinese MAC ( 10 mg/m3 ) .	2 233 23
15330389-8	Clinical complaints and abnormal electrocardiograms were not significantly increased in exposed workers .	
15330389-9	No significant effect of CS2 on blood pressure , cholesterol , HDL and LDL cholesterol or triglycerides was found .	11 1 11121 1112 111 112
15330389-10	Further studies are recommended to elucidate the mechanism of cardiac intoxication after CS2 exposure .	
15330389-11	CONCLUSION This study showed that Chinese workers exposed to CS2 did not have more clinical complaints , nor more ECG abnormalities than controls and no adverse effects were found in their lipids at an exposure level below the current TLV .	
15330389-12	The present results indicate that differences of health effects reported worldwide are possibly due to different exposure levels .	
15330389-13	They also indicate that the current Chinese MAC ( 10 mg/m3 ) sufficiently protects workers against negative cardiovascular effects .	
16015263-0	OBJECTIVE The effect of drinking deep-sea water on hair minerals was studied in patients with atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome ( AEDS ) .	
16015263-1	Study of hair minerals revealed an imbalance of essential minerals and an increase in toxic minerals in AEDS patients .	
16015263-2	DESIGN After drinking deep-sea water ( Amami no Mizu ) for 6 months in AEDS patients , hair minerals ( essential minerals and toxic minerals ) , clinical evaluation of the skin symptoms were compared before drinking with after drinking .	24 12 1 123 241 2
16015263-3	SUBJECTS After obtaining informed consent , 33 patients ( mean age 26 y , range 1-50 y , 13 male and 20 female subjects ) with mild to moderate AEDS were enrolled .	
16015263-4	RESULTS After drinking deep-sea water , the levels of the essential mineral , potassium ( K ) , were significantly decreased , while the levels of selenium ( Se ) increased .	
16015263-5	On the other hand , drinking deep-sea water significantly decreased the levels of the toxic minerals , mercury and lead .	
16015263-6	Moreover , after drinking deep-sea water , the skin symptoms were improved in 27 out of 33 patients .	
16015263-7	CONCLUSION These results indicate that the mineral abnormalities/imbalance may be involved in the pathogenesis of AEDS , and that drinking deep-sea water may be useful in the treatment of AEDS .	
21915069-0	OBJECTIVE Cytokeratin 18 ( CK18 ) is a novel serologic biomarker for occupational liver disease .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21915069-1	The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of CK18 elevation in elastomer/polymer workers exposed to acrylonitrile , 1,3-butadiene , and styrene .	
21915069-2	METHODS A total of 82 chemical workers were evaluated .	
21915069-3	Cytokeratin 18 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and proinflammatory cytokines were measured by multi-analyte chemiluminescent detection .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21915069-4	RESULTS Thirty-nine percent ( 32 of 82 ) had elevated CK18 levels , which were not explained by alcohol or obesity , except in potentially four cases .	
21915069-5	The pattern of CK18 elevation was consistent with toxicant-associated steatohepatitis ( TASH ) in the majority of cases ( 78% ) .	
21915069-6	Tumor necrosis factor Î± , interleukin-6 , interleukin-8 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were increased in these workers compared with those with normal CK18 levels .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21915069-7	CONCLUSIONS These results suggest a high prevalence of occupational liver disease and TASH in elastomer/polymer workers with elevated proinflammatory cytokines .	
16509313-0	Concentrations of 19 perfluorochemicals have been quantified in human blood and in some marine food resources from the region of the Gulf of GdaÃ±sk at the Baltic Sea south coast in Poland .	1 122 12
16509313-1	We indicate that in addition to PFOS and PFOA , a further 8 perfluorochemicals bioaccumulate in the human body .	
16509313-2	Food chain is an important route of exposure for all 10 perfluoroalkyl compounds detected in nonoccupationally exposed humans .	24 2 243
16509313-3	Individuals who declared to have a high fish intake in their diet ( mainly Baltic fish ) on average contained the highest load of all 10 fluorochemicals when compared with the other human subpopulations .	24 2 243
16509313-4	Baltic seafood has been found to highly influence human body burden of PFHxS , PFOS , PFOSA , PFHxA , PFHpA , PFNA , PFDA , PFUnDA , and PFDoDA , and to a lesser extent PFOA .	24 2 243
16522832-0	CONTEXT Evidence on the health risks associated with short-term exposure to fine particles ( particulate matter &lt ; or =2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter [ PM2.5] ) is limited .	
16522832-1	Results from the new national monitoring network for PM2.5 make possible systematic research on health risks at national and regional scales .	2 231 23
16522832-2	OBJECTIVES To estimate risks of cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5 for Medicare enrollees and to explore heterogeneity of the variation of risks across regions .	2 231 23
16522832-3	DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A national database comprising daily time-series data daily for 1999 through 2002 on hospital admission rates ( constructed from the Medicare National Claims History Files ) for cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and injuries , ambient PM2.5 levels , and temperature and dew-point temperature for 204 US urban counties ( population &gt;200,000 ) with 11.5 million Medicare enrollees ( aged &gt;65 years ) living an average of 5.9 miles from a PM2.5 monitor .	2 231 23
16522832-4	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Daily counts of county-wide hospital admissions for primary diagnosis of cerebrovascular , peripheral , and ischemic heart diseases , heart rhythm , heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and respiratory infection , and injuries as a control outcome .	
16522832-5	RESULTS There was a short-term increase in hospital admission rates associated with PM2.5 for all of the health outcomes except injuries .	2 231 23
16522832-6	The largest association was for heart failure , which had a 1.28% ( 95% confidence interval , 0.78%-1.78% ) increase in risk per 10-microg/m3 increase in same-day PM2.5 .	2 231 23
16522832-7	Cardiovascular risks tended to be higher in counties located in the Eastern region of the United States , which included the Northeast , the Southeast , the Midwest , and the South .	
16522832-8	CONCLUSION Short-term exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases .	
16021253-0	The nervous system can be damaged when the population is exposed to methyl mercury ( MeHg ) by ingesting fish , and children deserve special attention due to their increased susceptibility as compared to adults .	
16021253-1	A comparative cross-sectional study was performed in order to investigate the use of a battery of neurological development tests in two groups of 209 riverine children from 3 to 7 years old : a group exposed to moderate levels of MeHg ( n = 75 ) and a control group ( n = 134 ) .	1 11 112
16021253-2	The study included a questionnaire , the collection of scalp hair samples for determination of total mercury concentration , and performance on a test for evaluating neurological function in children .	1 123 12
16021253-3	Riverine children presented higher exposure to MeHg ( mean hair Hg = 5.37 +/- 3.35 microg x g(-1) ) in comparison to the control group ( mean Hg = 2.08 +/- 1.37 microg x g(-1) ) .	1 12 123
16021253-4	Both groups showed a high proportion of children with what was considered " non-normal " performance , suggesting that the results could not be related to mercury exposure and that this type of test presented limitations for use with river-dwelling Amazon communities .	
16037607-0	Postpartum scalp hair samples from 82 term-pregnancy mother/ neonate pairs were analyzed for their concentrations of zinc ( Zn ) , copper ( Cu ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , and lead ( Pb ) , using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry .	1 123 12
16037607-1	Maternal and neonatal Zn concentrations had geometric means ( and 99% confidence intervals ) of 122.5 microg/g ( 117.9--131.5 microg/g ) and 146.9 microg ( 141.5--156.7 microg/g ) respectively .	
16037607-2	Corresponding Cu values were 18.4 microg/g ( 17.6--23.8 microg/g ) and 6.7 microg/g ( 6.3--7.6 microg/g ) .	
16037607-3	Those of Cd were 0.49 microg/g ( 0.47--0.69 microg/g ) in the mothers and 0.57 microg/g ( 0.55--0.86 microg/g ) in the neonates .	
16037607-4	For Pb , they were 7.95 microg/g ( 7.60--9.32 microg/g ) and 4.56 microg/g ( 4.39--5.56 microg/g ) .	
16037607-5	Cigarette smoking , despite its relatively low prevalence ( 19.5% ) , was associated with lower Zn and higher Cd and Pb concentrations and in lower Zn/Cd and Zn/Pb molar concentration ratios .	
16037607-6	Smoking also altered interelemental relationships , particularly those of Zn with Cd and Pb and those between Cd and Pb .	
16037607-7	Smoking frequency appeared to show negative dose-response effects on maternal and neonatal Zn concentrations , Zn/Pb molar concentration ratios , and birth weight .	1 11 112
16037607-8	Mothers with a history of oral contraceptive ( OC ) usage had significantly higher Cu concentrations and lower Zn/Cu molar concentration ratios than non users , with the highest Cu concentrations and lowest Zn/Cu values being associated with third-generation OCs .	24 244 2
16037607-9	No similar effects were elicited in the respective neonatal Cu concentrations .	
16037607-10	Neither alcohol consumption nor prenatal supplementation with iron and/or folic acid had discernible effects on the maternal or neonatal elemental concentrations .	
16037607-11	The data from this study suggest that in a given population of term-pregnancy mothers and neonates , significant interindividual variations in hair trace element concentrations can occur , irrespective of commonality of general environment , and that lifestyle factors , including cigarette smoking and OC usage history , can be significant contributory factors to such variations .	123 12 23 1 2 232
16037607-12	The data are discussed in relation to the effects of smoking-associated exposure to Cd and Pb exposure on Zn availability for placental transfer , as well as on the quantitative maternal Zn supply levels to the fetus resulting from the known tendency of smokers to have lower dietary intakes of Zn .	2 232 23
15074692-0	A model is developed that predicts exposure and absorbed dose for chemical contaminants in household drinking water via three pathways : inhalation , direct and indirect ingestion , and dermal penetration .	24 22 23 2 241 232
15074692-1	Extensive probability distributions for building characteristics , activity and water use patterns , operating conditions of water devices , and physiological characteristics of the general population are developed .	
15074692-2	The impacts of different operating conditions on mass transfer coefficients for the shower , bath , washing machine , dishwasher , and faucet are established .	
15074692-3	Dichlorobromomethane , inorganic lead , and endosulfan , three compounds associated with adverse birth outcomes that have significantly different chemical properties , are selected for analysis .	
15074692-4	The primary exposure pathways for dichlorobromomethane are inhalation ( 62% ) and ingestion ( 27% ) .	24 2 23
15074692-5	Seventy percent of total exposure to endosulfan comes from ingestion , and 18% from dermal sorption with the remaining 12% due to inhalation .	24 2 22 23
15074692-6	Virtually all ( 99.9% ) of the exposure to lead occurs via ingestion .	
15074692-7	A nested Monte Carlo analysis shows that natural variability contributes significantly more ( a factor of 10 ) toward total uncertainty than knowledge uncertainty ( a factor of 1.5 ) .	
15074692-8	Better identification of certain critical input variables ( ventilation rate in the shower and bathroom , ingestion rate , the boiling water mass transfer coefficient , and skin permeability ) is required .	
14643286-0	The lifetime cancer risk and the hazard index of trihalomethanes ( THMs ) through oral ingestion , dermal absorption , and inhalation exposure from tap water in 19 districts in Hong Kong are estimated .	24 22 23 2 241 232
14643286-1	The most dominant THMs are chloroform and bromodichloromethane ( BDCM ) in Hong Kong tap water .	
14643286-2	Among the three different pathways , residents have a higher risk of cancer through oral ingestion than through the other two pathways .	
14643286-3	The lifetime cancer risks through oral ingestion and dermal absorption for BDCM make the highest percentage contribution ( 59% ) to total risks , followed by chloroform ( 24% ) .	24 2 22
14643286-4	The chloroform and BDCM are at or above the negligible risk level of 10(-6) by a factor of 10 or more in most districts .	
14643286-5	Among the 19 districts , people living in Sai Kung have the highest risk of cancer due to the THM exposure through the multipathways , mainly because of the exposure to BDCM and dibromochloromethane ( DBCM ) .	
14643286-6	The total cancer risk analysis indicates that each year approximately 10 out of the seven million Hong Kong residents could get cancer from the daily intake of water .	24 2 241
16081465-0	Skin exposure to permanent hair dye compounds was assessed in 33 hairdressers using a previously evaluated hand rinse method .	2 22
16081465-1	Hand rinse samples were collected from each hand before the start of hair dyeing , after application of the dye and after cutting the newly-dyed hair .	2 22
16081465-2	Sixteen of the hairdressers did not use gloves during dye application , and none used gloves while cutting the dyed hair .	
16081465-3	The samples were analysed for pertinent aromatic amines and resorcinol ( RES ) using an HPLC method. 10 of 54 hair dye mixtures contained 1,4-phenylenediamine ( PPD ) , 40 toluene-2,5-diaminesulphate ( TDS ) , and 44 RES .	
16081465-4	After application of the hair dye , PPD was found in samples from 4 hairdressers , TDS in 12 and RES in 21 .	
16081465-5	PPD was found in samples from 3 of the 17 hairdressers that used gloves during application of the hair dye , TDS in 5 and RES in 11 .	
16081465-6	In the group that did not use gloves during the application of hair dye ( n = 16 ) PPD was found in samples from 1 hairdresser , TDS in 7 and RES in 11 .	
16081465-7	After cutting the dyed hair , PPD was found in samples from 5 hairdressers , TDS in 14 and RES in 20 .	
16081465-8	Analysis of samples of newly-dyed hair cuttings revealed the presence of aromatic amines and/or RES in 11/12 samples .	1 123 12
16081465-9	Our conclusion is that hairdressers ' skin is exposed to allergenic compounds during hair dyeing .	2 22
16081465-10	Exposure occurs from dye application , from cutting newly-dyed hair and from background exposure .	
16081465-11	The exposure loadings are in the level , where there is a risk of sensitization and/or elicitation of contact allergy ( i.e. for PPD 22-939 nmol per hand ) .	
16081465-12	The glove use observed in this study was often improper , and was insufficient to prevent exposure .	
16081465-13	To reduce exposure , improved skin protection and work routines are important .	
16083189-0	OBJECTIVE To assess the nerve conduction functions among female patients with arsenical dermatoses compared with the controls .	
16083189-1	DESIGN Cross-sectional analytic study SUBJECTS AND METHOD Thirty females with skin lesions consistent with arsenical dermatoses and 27 controls who met the inclusion criteria were investigated by nerve conduction functions .	1 11 112
16083189-2	Case findings resulted from a house-to-house survey in village 12 , Ronphibun subdistrict and village 5 , Saothong subdistrict , Nakhon Si Thammarat Province , southern Thailand in 1995 .	
16083189-3	RESULTS Differences between the arsenic-exposed population and the reference group regarding nerve conduction velocities ( NCVs ) , proximal and distal latencies and amplitudes of sensory and motor nerve action potentials were not found except for the absent response to the sural nerve stimulation in three subjects of the exposed group .	11 1 112
16083189-4	CONCLUSION The effects of arsenic toxicity on the peripheral nerves in the form of slow nerve conduction velocities were not found among female patients with arsenical dermatoses in Ronphibun .	
16083189-5	Some patients might have experienced arsenic neuropathy to some degree in the past ( before 1987 ) but they had recovered to some degree at the time of the present investigation ( 1996 ) as most of the patients with chronic arsenic poisoning in the present study changed their sources of drinking water from arsenic-contaminated shallow-well water to other sources such as rainwater , tap water or commercial bottled water .	1 11 112
21882865-0	Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) is the most prominent perfluoroalkyl contaminant in humans and wildlife , but there is great uncertainty in exposure pathways , particularly with respect to the importance of PFOS-precursors ( PreFOS ) .	
21882865-1	We explored the hypothesis that nonracemic proportions of chiral PFOS in serum are qualitative and semiquantitative biomarkers of human PreFOS exposure .	1 12
21882865-2	A new chiral HPLC-MS/MS method was developed for alpha-perfluoromethyl branched PFOS ( 1m-PFOS , typically 2-3% of total PFOS ) and applied to enantiomer fraction ( EF ) analysis in biological samples .	
21882865-3	In blood and tissues of rodents exposed subchronically to electrochemical PFOS , 1m-PFOS was racemic ( EF = 0.485-0.511 ) and no evidence for enantioselective excretion was found in this model mammal. 1m-PFOS in serum of pregnant women , from Edmonton , was significantly nonracemic , with a mean EF ( Â±standard deviation ) of 0.432 Â± 0.009 , similar to pooled North American serum .	1 122 12
21882865-4	In a highly exposed Edmonton family ( mother , father , and 5 children ) living in a house where ScotchGard had been applied repeatedly to carpet and upholstery , EFs ranged from 0.35 to 0.43 , significantly more nonracemic than in pregnant women .	1 122 12
21882865-5	Semiquantitative estimates of % serum 1m-PFOS coming from 1m-PreFOS biotransformation in both subpopulations were in reasonable agreement with model predictions of human exposure to PFOS from PreFOS .	
21882865-6	The data were overall suggestive that the measured nonracemic EFs were influenced by the relative extent of exposure to PreFOS .	
21882865-7	The possibility of using 1m-PFOS EFs for assessing the relative contribution of 1m-PreFOS ( or PreFOS in general ) in biological samples requires further application before being fully validated , but could be a powerful tool for probing general sources of PFOS in environments where the importance of PreFOS is unknown .	
11401761-0	Forest pesticide applicators constitute a unique pesticide use group .	
11401761-1	Aerial , mechanical-ground , and focal weed control by application of herbicides , in particular chlorophenoxy herbicides , yield diverse exposure scenarios .	
11401761-2	In the present work , we analyzed aberrations in G-banded chromosomes , reproductive hormone levels , and polymerase chain reaction-based V(D)J rearrangement frequencies in applicators whose exposures were mostly limited to chlorophenoxy herbicides .	1 1111 1112 111 11
11401761-3	Data from appliers where chlorophenoxy use was less frequent were also examined .	
11401761-4	The biomarker outcome data were compared to urinary levels of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2,4-D ) obtained at the time of maximum 2,4-D use .	1 12 127
11401761-5	Further comparisons of outcome data were made to the total volume of herbicides applied during the entire pesticide-use season.Twenty-four applicators and 15 minimally exposed foresters ( control ) subjects were studied .	
11401761-6	Categorized by applicator method , men who used a hand-held , backpack sprayer in their applications showed the highest average level ( 453.6 ppb ) of 2,4-D in urine .	1 12 127
11401761-7	Serum luteinizing hormone ( LH ) values were correlated with urinary 2,4-D levels , but follicle-stimulating hormone and free and total testosterone were not .	11 1 11121 11123 111 1112
11401761-8	At the height of the application season ; 6/7 backpack sprayers , 3/4 applicators who used multinozzle mechanical ( boom ) sprayers , 4/8 aerial applicators , and 2/5 skidder-radiarc ( closed cab ) appliers had two or more V(D)J region rearrangements per microgram of DNA .	
11401761-9	Only 5 of 15 minimally exposed ( control ) foresters had two or more rearrangements , and 3 of these 5 subjects demonstrated detectable levels of 2,4-D in the urine .	
11401761-10	Only 8/24 DNA samples obtained from the exposed group 10 months or more after their last chlorophenoxy use had two rearrangements per microgram of DNA , suggesting that the exposure-related effects observed were reversible and temporary .	
11401761-11	Although urinary 2,4-D levels were not correlated with chromosome aberration frequency , chromosome aberration frequencies were correlated with the total volume of herbicides applied , including products other than 2,4-D .	1111 1 111 11
11401761-12	In summary , herbicide applicators with high urinary levels of 2,4-D ( backpack and boom spray applications ) exhibited elevated LH levels .	1 12 127
11401761-13	They also exhibited altered genomic stability as measured by V(D)J rearrangement frequency , which appears reversible months after peak exposure .	
11401761-14	Though highly detailed , the limited sample size warrants cautious interpretation of the data .	
11021608-0	Our aim was to examine the contribution of an infant's indoor environment to childhood asthma using prospective data .	2 232 23
11021608-1	We conducted a cross-sectional asthma survey in 1995 on 92% ( 6,378/6,911 ) of 7-year-olds in Tasmania , Australia .	
11021608-2	We linked these data with data collected in 1988 as part of the Tasmanian Infant Health Survey , which was designed to investigate sudden infant death .	
11021608-3	We were able to match 863 records out of the 1,111 in the 1988 survey and the 6,378 in the 1995 survey .	
11021608-4	The former group was interviewed at home at 1 month of age .	
11021608-5	In homes where at least one adult smoked in 1988 , reported infant exposure to smoking in the same room in 1988 was associated with increased asthma by 1995 ( relative risk = 1.52 ; 95% confidence interval = 1.01-2.29 ) after adjustment for confounders .	2 232 23
11021608-6	The associations between infant exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and asthma were not consistent , however .	2 232 23
11021608-7	Gas heater use in 1988 was associated with asthma ( relative risk = 1.92 ; 95% confidence interval = 1.33-2.76 ) .	
11021608-8	Markers of aeroallergen exposure at 1 month of age were not materially associated with asthma or wheeze .	
11021608-9	In some settings , air circulation practice with regard to bedroom door closure appeared important .	
11021608-10	Poor indoor air quality may play an important role in the development of childhood asthma .	
10819182-0	The authors of this paper chose several target compounds that have been found in average US homes , applied the current United States Environmental Protection Agency ( USEPA ) Superfund risk assessment methodologies to indoor air quality , and produced risk numbers for hazard quotients and predicted increases in incidence of cancer which would be unacceptable at US hazardous waste sites .	2 232 23
10819182-1	The calculations were made for the average child and adult with USEPA default exposure values .	2
10819182-2	Calculations were also made for a worst case scenario using maximum concentrations and exposure estimates defined by the USEPA as describing the reasonable exposure ( RME ) .	2
10819182-3	Significant cancer risks and non-cancer hazard quotients were predicted .	
16198357-0	A new method has been developed for the multi-residue measurement of the main brominated flame retardants ( alpha- and gamma-hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) , tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBP-A ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers including decabromodiphenyl ether ) in human biological matrices ( serum , adipose tissue and breast milk ) .	1 121 122 12 124
16198357-1	The proposed sample preparation procedure focused on reduced solvent and consumable consumption and associated procedural contamination , as well as reduced sample size .	
16198357-2	This protocol was fully validated and was proved to be suitable for identification of brominated flame retardant residues at ultra-trace level , as attested by preliminary results on real samples .	
16584725-0	The detection of exposure of pregnant women to toxicants in the environment is important because these compounds can be harmful to the health of the woman and her fetus .	
16584725-1	The aim of this study was to analyze for pesticides/herbicides in paired maternal hair and blood samples to determine the most appropriate matrix for detecting maternal exposure to these compounds .	1 122 12 123
16584725-2	A total of 449 pregnant women were prospectively recruited at midgestation from an agricultural site in the Philippines where a preliminary survey indicated significant use at home and on the farm of the following compounds : propoxur , cyfluthrin , chlorpyrifos , cypermethrin , pretilachlor , bioallethrin , malathion , diazinon , and transfluthrin .	
16584725-3	Paired maternal hair and blood samples were obtained from each subject upon recruitment into the study ( midgestation ) and at birth and were analyzed for the above compounds , as well as lindane and DDT [ 1,1,1-trichloro-2-2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane ] , and some of their known metabolites by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry .	1 122 12 123
16584725-4	The highest exposure rate was seen for propoxur and bioallethrin and maternal hair analysis provided the highest detection rate for these two compounds , compared to blood , at both time periods : ( 1 ) At midgestation , 10.5% positive for propoxur in hair compared to 0.7% in blood ( P&lt;0.001 ) and for bioallethrin , 11.9% positive in hair compared to 0% in blood ( P &lt ; or = 0.001 ) , and ( 2 ) at birth , 11.8% positive for propoxur in hair compared to 4% in blood ( P &lt ; or = 0.001 ) and for bioallethrin , 7.8% in hair compared to 0% in blood ( P &lt ; or = 0.001 ) .	1 12 123
16584725-5	A small number of maternal hair samples were also positive for malathion , chlorpyrifos , pretilachlor , and DDT .	1 12 123
16584725-6	Only a few of the pesticide metabolites were detected , principally 3-phenoxybenzoic acid , malathion monocarboxylic acid , and DDE [ 1,1,dichloro-2-2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene ] , and they were mostly found in maternal blood .	
16584725-7	There was a significant association between the use of the home spray pesticide , Baygon , and propoxur in maternal hair at birth ( P=0.001 ) and between the use of a slow-burning mosquito coil and the presence of bioallethrin in maternal hair at midgestation and at birth ( P=0.001 , P &lt ; or = 0.041 , respectively ) .	24 12 1 244 123 2
16584725-8	There is significant exposure of the pregnant woman to pesticides , particularly to pesticides that are used at home .	
16584725-9	Our study demonstrates the advantages of analyzing maternal hair as a readily available biologic matrix for studying maternal exposure to toxicants in the environment , compared to blood .	
16584725-10	For propoxur , there was a 3- to 15-fold higher detection rate of the pesticide in maternal hair as compared to blood .	
16584725-11	As for the other pesticides , bioallethrin , malathion , chlorpyrifos , and DDT were exclusively found in maternal hair compared to blood .	
16584725-12	On the other hand , pesticide metabolites were infrequently found in maternal hair or maternal blood .	
16584725-13	Pesticides in blood most likely represent acute exposure , whereas pesticides in hair represent past and/or concurrent exposure .	
16584725-14	The high sensitivity , wide window of exposure , availability , and ease of hair collection are distinct advantages in using hair to detect exposure to pesticides among pregnant women .	
16584725-15	However , pesticides in maternal hair may also be secondary to passive exposure and therefore not truly representative of the internal pesticide dose .	
16584725-16	Finally , the analysis of maternal hair for pesticides as an index of maternal exposure to pesticides in the environment allows the institution of measures to prevent further exposure during pregnancy .	
21868305-0	BACKGROUND Mercury ( Hg ) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with neurodevelopmental and immune system effects .	
21868305-1	An informative biomarker of Hg-induced immunotoxicity could aid studies on the potential contribution to immune-related health effects .	
21868305-2	OBJECTIVES Our objectives were to test the hypothesis that methylmercury ( MeHg ) exposures affect levels of serum biomarkers and to examine interactions between Hg and selenium ( Se ) in terms of these responses .	
21868305-3	METHODS This cross-sectional epidemiological study assessed adults living along the TapajÃ³s River , a system long affected by MeHg .	
21868305-4	We measured antinuclear ( ANA ) and antinucleolar ( ANoA ) autoantibody levels and eight cytokines in serum samples ( n = 232 ) .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21868305-5	Total Hg ( including MeHg ) and Se were measured in blood , plasma , hair , and urine .	1 122 12 127 123
21868305-6	RESULTS The median ( range ) total Hg concentrations were 14.1 Î¼g/g ( 1.1-62.4 ) , 53.5 Î¼g/L ( 4.3-288.9 ) , 8.8 Î¼g/L ( 0.2-40 ) , and 3.0 Î¼g/L ( 0.2-16.1 ) for hair , blood , plasma , and urine , respectively .	
21868305-7	Elevated titers of ANA ( but not ANoA ) were positively associated with MeHg exposure ( log-transformed , for blood and plasma ) , unadjusted [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.6 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.1 , 6.2 ] and adjusted for sex and age ( OR = 2.9 ; 95% CI : 1.1 , 7.5 ) .	
21868305-8	Proinflammatory [ interleukin ( IL)-6 and interferon ( IFN)-Î³ ] , anti-inflammatory ( IL-4 ) , and IL-17 cytokine levels were increased with MeHg exposure ; however , in the subset of the population with elevated ANA , proinflammatory IL-1Î² , IL-6 , IFN-Î³ , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-Î± and anti-inflammatory ( IL-4 ) cytokine levels were decreased with MeHg exposure .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21868305-9	Although Se status was associated with MeHg level ( correlation coefficient = 0.86 ; 95% CI : 0.29 , 1.43 ) , Se status was not associated with any changes in ANA and did not modify associations between Hg and ANA titers .	
21868305-10	CONCLUSIONS MeHg exposure was associated with an increased ANA and changes in serum cytokine profile .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21868305-11	Moreover , alterations in serum cytokine profiles differed based on ANA response , suggesting a specific phenotype of MeHg susceptibility .	11 1 11123 111 1112
21868305-12	Further research on the potential health implications of these observed immunological changes is warranted .	
16597458-0	A large pentachlorophenol ( PCP)-manufacturing plant located in southwestern Taiwan operated between 1965 and 1982 .	
16597458-1	The present study was conducted to ascertain whether an increased body burden of dioxins existed in pregnant women living in an area of Tainan city contaminated by chemicals from this plant .	
16597458-2	Twenty-eight pregnant subjects , 21-39 years of age and residing in the study area between March and December of 2004 with a mean dwelling time of 6.07+/-6.11 years , were recruited .	
16597458-3	Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins , dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) , and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in serum of recruited residents were determined .	1 122 12
16597458-4	Pregnant women residing in the study area &gt;3 years had significantly higher PCDD ( 7.48 versus 5.13 pg-toxic equivalents [ TEQ]/g-lipid ) and dioxin-like PCB ( 6.70 versus 3.74 pg-TEQ/g-lipid ) values as compared to those residing &lt ; or = 3 years .	24 12 1 122 2 243
16597458-5	Furthermore , dioxin concentrations increased with increasing dwelling time .	
16597458-6	Statistical analyses performed according to demographic characteristics and socioeconomic and dietary habits revealed that total TEQ values were significantly associated with fish consumption and smoking status .	24 2 243
16597458-7	Dioxin congeners with greater degrees of chlorine substitution ( e.g. , HpCDD/F and OCDD/F ) partitioned to greater degrees in the subjects of this study as compared to subjects in the general Taiwanese population .	
16597458-8	The findings of this study strongly implicate the activity of the PCP manufacturing plant in the observed increase in dioxin body burden .	
16597458-9	Investigation of the health consequences of this increased body burden is recommended .	
21868304-0	BACKGROUND Air pollution effects on children's neurodevelopment have recently been suggested to occur most likely through the oxidative stress pathway .	
21868304-1	OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess whether prenatal exposure to residential air pollution is associated with impaired infant mental development , and whether antioxidant/detoxification factors modulate this association .	1 11 112
21868304-2	METHODS In the Spanish INfancia y Medio Ambiente ( INMA ; Environment and Childhood ) Project , 2,644 pregnant women were recruited during their first trimester .	
21868304-3	Nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) and benzene were measured with passive samplers covering the study areas .	
21868304-4	Land use regression models were developed for each pollutant to predict average outdoor air pollution levels for the entire pregnancy at each residential address .	2 231 23
21868304-5	Maternal diet was obtained at first trimester through a validated food frequency questionnaire .	24 2 243
21868304-6	Around 14 months , infant mental development was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development .	1 11 112
21868304-7	RESULTS Among the 1,889 children included in the analysis , mean exposure during pregnancy was 29.0 Î¼g/m3 for NO2 and 1.5 Î¼g/m3 for benzene .	
21868304-8	Exposure to NO2 and benzene showed an inverse association with mental development , although not statistically significant , after adjusting for potential confounders [ Î² ( 95% confidence interval ) = -0.95 ( -3.90 , 1.89 ) and -1.57 ( -3.69 , 0.56 ) , respectively , for a doubling of each compound ] .	
21868304-9	Stronger inverse associations were estimated for both pollutants among infants whose mothers reported low intakes of fruits/vegetables during pregnancy [ -4.13 ( -7.06 , -1.21 ) and -4.37 ( -6.89 , -1.86 ) for NO2 and benzene , respectively ] , with little evidence of associations in the high-intake group ( interaction p-values of 0.073 and 0.047 ) .	24 2 243
21868304-10	Inverse associations were also stronger in non-breast-fed infants and infants with low maternal vitamin D , but effect estimates and interactions were not significant .	
21868304-11	CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to residential air pollutants may adversely affect infant mental development , but potential effects may be limited to infants whose mothers report low antioxidant intakes .	
7878448-0	210Po and 210Pb concentrations in urine , hair and skin smear samples from individuals using phosphated fertilizers have been compared with a control group of occupationally unexposed individuals .	123 12 22 1 2 127
7878448-1	Urine and hair samples of the test group showed slightly higher concentrations of 210Po and 210Pb than those observed for the control group .	
7878448-2	These concentrations remained , however , lower than those for uranium mine workers .	
7878448-3	Skin smear values indicated contamination by direct contact with dust from fertilizers and this may contribute to skin cancer induction in this risk population .	2 22
16600459-0	A market basket survey was carried out with the aim to assess the levels of lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , copper ( Cu ) and zinc ( Zn ) in various fruits and vegetables sold in Egyptian markets .	
16600459-1	Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to estimate and evaluate the levels of these metals .	
16600459-2	The results of this survey showed that the average concentrations detected were ranged from 0.01 to 0.87 , 0.01 to 0.15 , 0.83 to 18.3 and 1.36 to 20.9 mg/kg for Pb , Cd , Cu and Zn , respectively .	
16600459-3	The highest mean levels of Pb , Cd , Cu and Zn were detected in strawberries , cucumber , date and spinach , respectively .	
16600459-4	The levels of the metals compare with those reported for similar fruits and vegetables from some other parts of the world .	
16600459-5	The daily intakes of Pb , Cd , Cu and Zn through fruits and vegetables have also been estimated .	24 2 243
16600459-6	They are found to be below the recommended tolerable levels proposed by [ Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives 1999 .	
16600459-7	Summary and conclusions .	
16600459-8	In : 53rd Meeting , Rome , June 1-10 , 1999 ] and may not constitute a health hazards for consumers .	
16607188-0	OBJECTIVES We sought to investigate changes in exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) pH in healthy workers exposed to welding fumes .	
16607188-1	METHODS Fourteen exposed participants ( median age 39 years , 5 smokers ) and 8 nonexposed controls ( median age 44 years , 1 smoker ) were monitored at an apprentice welding school .	2 233 23
16607188-2	Exposure to fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microm ( PM2.5 ) was assessed using cyclone samplers .	23 2 233
16607188-3	EBC samples were collected at baseline and at the end of the work shift .	
16607188-4	EBC samples were deaerated using argon and pH values were measured using standard pH microelectrodes .	
16607188-5	RESULTS Mean +/- SEM PM2.5 levels were 1.17 +/- 0.18 mg/m for exposed subjects and 0.03 +/- 0.01 mg/m for controls .	
16607188-6	Baseline median ( range ) EBC pH values for the control and exposed group were similar ( P = 0.86 ) , 7.21 ( 4.91 to 8.26 ) , and 7.39 ( 4.85 to 7.79 ) , respectively .	
16607188-7	The exposed subjects had a small-but-marginally significant ( P = 0.07 ) pre- to post-work shift increase in pH of 0.28 , whereas the control group showed a minimal increase of only 0.03 ( P = 0.56 ) .	
16607188-8	Compared with the control group , the exposed group had a median cross-shift pH increase of 0.25 ( P = 0.49 ) .	
16607188-9	CONCLUSIONS The aerosolized fine particulate matter contained in metal fumes may be associated with an acute increase in EBC pH values .	
16607188-10	Further study is necessary to investigate the acute rise in EBC pH after acute exposure to welding fume .	
16242602-0	Although a rich source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) that may confer multiple health benefits , some fish also contain methyl mercury ( MeHg ) , which may harm the developing fetus .	
16242602-1	U.S. government recommendations for women of childbearing age are to modify consumption of high MeHg fish to reduce MeHg exposure , while recommendations encourage fish consumption among the general population because of the nutritional benefits .	
16242602-2	The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis convened an expert panel ( see acknowledgements ) to quantify the net impact of resulting hypothetical changes in fish consumption across the population .	
16242602-3	This paper quantifies the impact of prenatal MeHg exposure on cognitive development .	
16242602-4	Other papers quantify the beneficial impact of prenatal intake of n-3 PUFAs on cognitive function and the extent to which fish consumption protects against coronary heart disease mortality and stroke in adults .	
16242602-5	This analysis aggregates results from three major prospective epidemiology studies to quantify the association between prenatal MeHg exposure and cognitive development as measured by intelligence quotient ( IQ ) .	1 11 112
16242602-6	It finds that prenatal MeHg exposure sufficient to increase the concentration of mercury in maternal hair at parturition by 1 microg/g decreases IQ by 0.7 points .	1 12 123
16242602-7	This paper identifies important sources of uncertainty influencing this estimate , concluding that the plausible range of values for this loss is 0 to 1.5 IQ points .	
16244432-0	To assess levels of dioxin background contamination and transfer of dioxins from mothers to unborn children and infants , concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and coplanar-polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) were measured in human samples from expectant and nursing mothers living in Nara , Japan .	
16244432-1	The average toxic equivalency quantities ( TEQs ) of PCDDs/PCDFs and Co-PCBs from circulating maternal blood , cord blood , placenta , milk taken 3-10 d after delivery , milk taken one month after delivery , and adipose tissue were 26 and 9.3 , 15 and 2.3 , 31 and 1.2 , 16 and 5.4 , 18 and 8.8 , and 16 and 7.7 pg-TEQ/g-fat , respectively .	12 1 121 122 124 126
16244432-2	Among the various PCDD/PCDF congeners , 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF contributed most heavily to the TEQs of all maternal samples .	
16244432-3	Among the various Co-PCB congeners , 3,3',4,4',5-PeCB ( #126 ) , 2,3,3',4,4',5-HxCB ( #156 ) , and 2,3',4,4',5-PeCB ( #118 ) contributed most heavily to the TEQs of all maternal samples .	
16244432-4	But , the concentrations and relative percentages of congeners differed among the various samples , suggesting that congeners showing high toxic equivalency factor accumulate in the placenta .	
21846610-0	BACKGROUND Dozens of studies link acute exposure to particulate matter ( PM ) air pollution with premature mortality and morbidity , but questions remain about which species and sources in the vast PM mixture are responsible for the observed health effects .	
21846610-1	Although a few studies exist on the effects of species and sources in U.S. cities , European cities-which have a higher proportion of diesel engines and denser urban populations-have not been well characterized .	
21846610-2	Information on the effects of specific sources could aid in targeting pollution control and in articulating the biological mechanisms of PM .	
21846610-3	OBJECTIVES Our study examined the effects of various PM sources on daily mortality for 2003 through 2007 in Barcelona , a densely populated city in the northeast corner of Spain .	2 231 23
21846610-4	METHODS Source apportionment for PM â¤ 2.5 Î¼m and â¤ 10 Âµm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5 and PM10 ) using positive matrix factorization identified eight different factors .	
21846610-5	Case-crossover regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of each factor .	
21846610-6	RESULTS Several sources of PM2.5 , including vehicle exhaust , fuel oil combustion , secondary nitrate/organics , minerals , secondary sulfate/organics , and road dust , had statistically significant associations ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality .	
21846610-7	Also , in some cases relative risks for a respective interquartile range increase in concentration were higher for specific sources than for total PM2.5 mass .	
21846610-8	CONCLUSIONS These results along with those from our multisource models suggest that traffic , sulfate from shipping and long-range transport , and construction dust are important contributors to the adverse health effects linked to PM .	
16622140-0	CONTEXT Dental ( silver ) amalgam is a widely used restorative material containing 50% elemental mercury that emits small amounts of mercury vapor .	
16622140-1	No randomized clinical trials have determined whether there are significant health risks associated with this low-level mercury exposure .	
16622140-2	OBJECTIVE To assess the safety of dental amalgam restorations in children .	
16622140-3	DESIGN A randomized clinical trial in which children requiring dental restorative treatment were randomized to either amalgam for posterior restorations or resin composite instead of amalgam .	24 244 2
16622140-4	Enrollment commenced February 1997 , with annual follow-up for 7 years concluding in July 2005 .	
16622140-5	SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 507 children in Lisbon , Portugal , aged 8 to 10 years with at least 1 carious lesion on a permanent tooth , no previous exposure to amalgam , urinary mercury level &lt;10 microg/L , blood lead level &lt;15 microg/dL , Comprehensive Test of Nonverbal Intelligence IQ &gt ; or =67 , and with no interfering health conditions .	11 1 127 12 112
16622140-6	INTERVENTION Routine , standard-of-care dental treatment , with one group receiving amalgam restorations for posterior lesions ( n = 253 ) and the other group receiving resin composite restorations instead of amalgam ( n = 254 ) .	
16622140-7	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neurobehavioral assessments of memory , attention/concentration , and motor/visuomotor domains , as well as nerve conduction velocities .	1 11 112
16622140-8	RESULTS During the 7-year trial period , children had a mean of 18.7 tooth surfaces ( median , 16 ) restored in the amalgam group and 21.3 ( median , 18 ) restored in the composite group .	24 244 2
16622140-9	Baseline mean creatinine-adjusted urinary mercury levels were 1.8 microg/g in the amalgam group and 1.9 microg/g in the composite group , but during follow-up were 1.0 to 1.5 microg/g higher in the amalgam group than in the composite group ( P&lt;.001 ) .	24 12 1 244 2 127
16622140-10	There were no statistically significant differences in measures of memory , attention , visuomotor function , or nerve conduction velocities ( average z scores were very similar , near zero ) for the amalgam and composite groups over all 7 years of follow-up , with no statistically significant differences observed at any time point ( P values from .29 to .91 ) .	1 11 112
16622140-11	Starting at 5 years after initial treatment , the need for additional restorative treatment was approximately 50% higher in the composite group .	
16622140-12	CONCLUSIONS In this study , children who received dental restorative treatment with amalgam did not , on average , have statistically significant differences in neurobehavioral assessments or in nerve conduction velocity when compared with children who received resin composite materials without amalgam .	
16622140-13	These findings , combined with the trend of higher treatment need later among those receiving composite , suggest that amalgam should remain a viable dental restorative option for children .

21835727-0	BACKGROUND Numerous studies have linked criteria air pollutants with adverse birth outcomes , but there is less information on the importance of specific emission sources , such as traffic , and air toxics .	
21835727-1	OBJECTIVES We used three exposure data sources to examine odds of term low birth weight ( LBW ) in Los Angeles , California , women when exposed to high levels of traffic-related air pollutants during pregnancy .	1 11 112
21835727-2	METHODS We identified term births during 1 June 2004 to 30 March 2006 to women residing within 5 miles of a South Coast Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD ) Multiple Air Toxics Exposure Study ( MATES III ) monitoring station .	2 231 23
21835727-3	Pregnancy period average exposures were estimated for air toxics , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , source-specific particulate matter &lt ; 2.5 Î¼m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5 ) based on a chemical mass balance model , criteria air pollutants from government monitoring data , and land use regression ( LUR ) model estimates of nitric oxide ( NO ) , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) .	2 231 23
21835727-4	Associations between these metrics and odds of term LBW ( &lt ; 2,500 g ) were examined using logistic regression .	
21835727-5	RESULTS Odds of term LBW increased approximately 5% per interquartile range increase in entire pregnancy exposures to several correlated traffic pollutants : LUR measures of NO , NO2 , and NOx , elemental carbon , and PM2.5 from diesel and gasoline combustion and paved road dust ( geological PM2.5 ) .	
21835727-6	CONCLUSIONS These analyses provide additional evidence of the potential impact of traffic-related air pollution on fetal growth .	1 11 112
21835727-7	Particles from traffic sources should be a focus of future studies .	
16307093-0	The analysis for arsenic in hair is commonly used in epidemiological studies to assess exposure to this toxic element .	
16307093-1	However , poor correlation between total arsenic concentration in hair and water sources have been found in previous studies .	1 123 12
16307093-2	Exclusive determination of endogenous arsenic in the hair , excluding external contamination has become an analytical challenge .	1 123 12
16307093-3	Arsenic speciation in hair appears as a new possibility for analytical assessing in As-exposure studies .	
16307093-4	This study applied a relative simple method for arsenic speciation in human hair based on water extraction and HPLC-HG-ICP-MS .	1 123 12
16307093-5	The concentration of arsenic species in human hair was assessed in chronically As(V)-exposed populations from two villages ( EsquiÃ±a and Illapata ) of the Atacama Desert , Chile .	
16307093-6	The arsenic concentrations in drinking water are 0.075 and 1.25 mg L(-1) , respectively , where As(V) represented between 92 and 99.5% of the total arsenic of the consumed waters .	24 2 241
16307093-7	On average , the total arsenic concentrations in hair from individuals of EsquiÃ±a and Illapata were 0.7 and 6.1 microg g(-1) , respectively .	
16307093-8	Four arsenic species , As(III) , DMA(V) , MMA(V) and As(V) , were detected and quantified in the hair extracts .	1 123 12
16307093-9	Assuming the found species in extracts represent the species in hair , more than 98% of the total arsenic in hair corresponded to inorganic As .	
16307093-10	On average , As(III) concentrations in hair were 0.25 and 3.75 microg g(-1) in EsquiÃ±a and Illapata , respectively ; while , the As(V) average concentrations were 0.15 and 0.45 microg g(-1) in EsquiÃ±a and Illapata , respectively .	
16307093-11	Methylated species represent less than 2% of the extracted As ( DMA(V)+ MMA(V) ) in both populations .	
16307093-12	As(III) in hair shows the best correlation with chronic exposure to As(V) in comparison to other species and total arsenic .	
16307093-13	In fact , concentrations of As(total) , As(III) and As(V) in hair samples are correlated with the age of the exposed individuals from Illapata ( R= 0.65 , 0.69 , 0.57 , respectively ) and with the time of residence in this village ( R= 0.54 , 0.71 and 0.58 , respectively ) .	1 123 12
16308561-0	To investigate whether children's nutritional status , especially the extent of wasting [ acute malnutrition as measured by weight-for-height Z ( WHZ ) score ] is associated with arsenic contamination of drinking water , a survey was carried out in two discrete rural areas located less than 30 km southeast and northeast of Dhaka , the capital of Bangladesh. 761 children between 7 and 14 years of age were randomly selected , one child per household .	1 11 112
16308561-1	The arsenic concentration in the tube well water used by each child and the prevalence and intensity of infection of three geo-helminths [ Ascaris lumbricoides , Trichuris trichiura and hookworm ( Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus) ] were determined .	24 2 241
16308561-2	Each child had their height and weight measured and WHZ score determined using the World Health Organization ( WHO ) reference values .	
16308561-3	Basic socio-demographic data and knowledge of arsenic poisoning were collected using a questionnaire. 62.2% of the households studied were using well water with arsenic concentrations above the 0.01 mg/L WHO guideline ( i.e. arsenic-contaminated households ) .	24 2 241
16308561-4	The mean WHZ score of all the 761 children was -0.843 ( sd 1.227 ) but children living in contaminated households were significantly more wasted than children living in noncontaminated households ( mean difference = -0.361 , p 0.001 ) .	
16308561-5	When the effects of the differences in socio-economic status and prevalence of geo-helminths were also taken into account , the difference in means remained highly significant ( -0.330 , p = 0.006 ) .	
16308561-6	This study suggests that arsenic contamination has a negative impact on children's acute nutritional status .	
23280302-0	There are few studies on associations between airborne microbial exposure , formaldehyde , plasticizers in dwellings and the symptoms compatible with the sick building syndrome ( SBS ) .	1 11 112
23280302-1	As a follow-up of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey ( ECRHS II ) , indoor measurements were performed in homes in three North European cities .	2 232 23
23280302-2	The aim was to examine whether volatile organic compounds of possible microbial origin ( MVOCs ) , and airborne levels of bacteria , molds , formaldehyde , and two plasticizers in dwellings were associated with the prevalence of SBS , and to study associations between MVOCs and reports on dampness and mold .	
23280302-3	The study included homes from three centers included in ECRHS II .	
23280302-4	A total of 159 adults ( 57% females ) participated ( 19% from Reykjavik , 40% from Uppsala , and 41% from Tartu ) .	
23280302-5	A random sample and additional homes with a history of dampness were included .	
23280302-6	Exposure measurements were performed in the 159 homes of the participants .	2
23280302-7	MVOCs were analyzed by GCMS with selective ion monitoring ( SIM ) .	
23280302-8	Symptoms were reported in a standardized questionnaire .	
23280302-9	Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression .	
23280302-10	In total 30.8% reported any SBS ( 20% mucosal , 10% general , and 8% dermal symptoms ) and 41% of the homes had a history of dampness and molds There were positive associations between any SBS and levels of 2-pentanol ( P=0.002 ) , 2-hexanone ( P=0.0002 ) , 2-pentylfuran ( P=0.009 ) , 1-octen-3-ol ( P=0.002 ) , formaldehyde ( P=0.05 ) , and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate ( Texanol ) ( P=0.05). 1-octen-3-ol ( P=0.009 ) and 3-methylfuran ( P=0.002 ) were associated with mucosal symptoms .	
23280302-11	In dwellings with dampness and molds , the levels of total bacteria ( P=0.02 ) , total mold ( P=0.04 ) , viable mold ( P=0.02 ) , 3-methylfuran ( P=0.008 ) and ethyl-isobutyrate ( P=0.02 ) were higher .	
23280302-12	In conclusion , some MVOCs like 1-octen-3-ol , formaldehyde and the plasticizer Texanol , may be a risk factor for sick building syndrome .	
23280302-13	Moreover , concentrations of airborne molds , bacteria and some other MVOCs were slightly higher in homes with reported dampness and mold .	2 23
21835436-0	BACKGROUND Previous studies observed associations between airborne particles and cardio-vascular disease .	
21835436-1	Questions , however , remain as to which size of the inhalable particles ( coarse , fine , or ultrafine ) exerts the most significant impact on health .	
21835436-2	METHODS For this retrospective study , data of the total number of 23,741 emergency service calls , registered between February 2002 and January 2003 in the City of Leipzig , were analysed , identifying 5326 as being related to cardiovascular incidences .	
21835436-3	Simultaneous particle exposure was determined for the particle sizes classes &lt;100 nm ( UFP ) , &lt;2.5 Î¼m ( PM2.5 ) and &lt;10 Î¼m ( PM10 ) .	2 231 23
21835436-4	We used a time resolution of 1 day for both parameters , emergency calls and exposure .	2 231 23
21835436-5	RESULTS Within the group of cardiovascular diseases , the diagnostic category of hypertensive crisis showed a significant association with particle exposure .	
21835436-6	The significant effect on hypertensive crisis was found for particles with a size of &lt;100 nm in diameter and starting with a lag of 2 days after exposure .	2 231 23
21835436-7	No consistent influence could be observed for PM2.5 and PM10 .	
21835436-8	The Odds Ratios on hypertensive crisis were significant for the particle size &lt;100 nm in diameter from day 2 post exposure OR=1.06 ( 95%CI : 1.02-1.10 , p=0.002 ) up to day 7 OR=1.05 ( 95%CI 1.02-1.09 , p=0.005 ) .	
21835436-9	CONCLUSION Ultrafine particles affect cardiovascular disease adversely , particularly hypertensive crises .	
21835436-10	Their effect is significant compared with PM2.5 and PM10 .	
21835436-11	It appears necessary , from a public health point of view , to consider regulating this type of particles using appropriate measurands as particle number .	
16440510-0	INTRODUCTION To understand the severity of the arsenic crisis in West Bengal , India , a detailed , 3-year study was undertaken in Murshidabad , one of the nine arsenic-affected districts in West Bengal .	
16440510-1	The district covers an area of 5324 km2 with a population of 5.3 million .	
16440510-2	METHODS Hand tubewell water samples and biologic samples were collected from Murshidabad and analyzed for arsenic by FI-HG-AAS method .	24 2 241
16440510-3	Inter laboratory analysis and analyses of standards were undertaken for quality assurance .	
16440510-4	RESULTS During our survey we analyzed 29,612 hand tubewell water samples for arsenic from both contaminated and non-contaminated areas , and 26% of the tubewells were found to have arsenic above 50 microg/L while 53.8% had arsenic above 10 microg/L .	24 2 241
16440510-5	Of the 26 blocks in Murshidabad , 24 were found to have arsenic above 50 microg/L .	
16440510-6	Based on our generated data we estimated that approximately 0.2 million hand tubewells are installed in all 26 blocks of Murshidabad and 1.8 million in nine arsenic-affected districts of West Bengal .	
16440510-7	It was estimated on the basis of our data that about 2.5 million and 1.2 million people were drinking arsenic-contaminated water with concentrations above 10 and 50 microg/L levels respectively in this district .	
16440510-8	The analysis of total 3800 biologic ( nail , urine , and hair ) samples from arsenic-affected villages revealed that 95% of the nail and 94% of the urine samples contained arsenic above the normal levels and 75% of the hair samples were found to have arsenic above the toxic level .	1 123 12 127
16440510-9	Thus , many villagers in the affected areas of Murshidabad might be subclinically affected .	
16440510-10	DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Comparing our extrapolated data with international dose response results , we estimated how many people may suffer from arsenical skin lesions and cancer .	
16440510-11	Finally , if the exposed population is provided safe water , better nutrition , and proper awareness about the arsenic problem , lives can be saved and countless suffering of the affected population can be avoided .	
16646448-0	Urinary methoxyphenols have been proposed as biomarkers for woodsmoke exposure , but the relationship between exposure and urinary methoxyphenol concentrations has not been characterized .	
16646448-1	We collected personal particulate matter2.5 and urine samples from 9 adults experimentally exposed to smoke from an open wood fire to characterize this relationship .	12 23 1 2 127 233
16646448-2	Personal exposures ( PM2.5 mean 1500 microg/ m3 ) varied 3.5-fold .	2 233 23
16646448-3	Twenty-two methoxyphenols , levoglucosan , and 17 polynuclear hydrocarbons were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry assays for personal filter samples and urine samples .	12 23 1 2 127 233
16646448-4	Most methoxyphenols had measurable preexposure levels .	
16646448-5	Propylguaiacol , syringol , methylsyringol , ethylsyringol , and propylsyringol had peak urinary concentrations after the woodsmoke exposure .	1 12 127
16646448-6	Eight subjects had peak urinary elimination of methoxyphenols within 6 h ( t1/2 3-5 h ) , whereas one had delayed elimination .	
16646448-7	Several metrics for urinary excretion were evaluated .	1 12 127
16646448-8	Analyte concentration was greatly affected by diuresis .	
16646448-9	Excretion rate and analyte concentrations normalized by creatinine gave a clearer signal and were equivalent in predictive ability .	
16646448-10	Twelve-hour average creatinine-normalized concentrations of each of the 5 methoxyphenols gave a Pearson correlation &gt ; or = 0.8 with their particle-phase concentration .	
16646448-11	The sum of urinary concentrations for the 5 methoxyphenols versus levoglucosan on personal filters gave a regression coefficient of 0.75 .	
16646448-12	This sum versus PM2.5 gave a regression coefficient of 0.79 .	
16646448-13	The intercept of this regression suggests that the threshold for detection of an acute exposure event would be approximately 760 microg/m3 particulate matter from woodsmoke .	
16646448-14	The signal-to-noise ( 12-h postexposure average/preexposure average ) ranged from 1.1 to 8 for the 5 methoxyphenols .	
16646448-15	Analysis of multiple compounds provided assurance that elevations were not artifactual due to food or other products .	
16650842-0	Methylmercury ( MeHg ) is one of the most risky substances to affect humans through fish consumption , and the fetus is known to be in the most susceptible group .	
16650842-1	Our objective in this study is to examine the relationships of total mercury ( THg ) and MeHg concentrations between umbilical cord tissue and other tissues as biomarkers of fetal exposure to MeHg in the Japanese population .	1 122 12
16650842-2	In total , 116 paired samples were collected in three Japanese districts , the Tsushima Islands , Fukuoka City , and Katsushika ward of metropolitan Tokyo .	
16650842-3	THg was measured for hair and THg and MeHg were measured in cord tissues , maternal blood , and cord blood .	1 122 12 123
16650842-4	The relationships among tissues in Hg concentrations were similar among districts .	
16650842-5	Therefore , we analyzed the relationships using all the samples .	
16650842-6	More than 90% of Hg in cord tissue , cord blood , and maternal blood was MeHg .	1 122 12
16650842-7	THg and MeHg in cord blood was about two times higher than in maternal blood .	
16650842-8	A strong correlation was found between THg and MeHg in cord tissue .	
16650842-9	The cord tissue THg and MeHg showed a strong correlation with cord blood Hg , which is recognized as the best biomarker for fetal exposure to MeHg .	
16650842-10	The findings of this study indicate the significance of cord tissue THg and MeHg as biomarkers for fetal exposure to MeHg at parturition .	
23063733-0	Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) and hexachlorocyclohexanes ( HCHs ) are widely detected in the environment , although they have been banned in China since 1980s .	
23063733-1	To better understand the route-specific daily uptake of the pesticides by humans , a total of 322 food , dust , and air samples were collected in Shanghai , China , during 2008-2011 .	24 242 2 243 23
23063733-2	The median concentrations were 0.2-126.6 and 0.03-1.6 ng/g wet weight for DDTs ( DDT and its metabolites ) and HCHs , respectively , in different types of foods .	
23063733-3	The values in dust ( indoors and outdoors ) were 5.7-29.8 and 1.3-5.4 ng/g , and 13.9Ã10(-3) and 2.6Ã10(-3)ng/m(3) in air ( gas+particle ) for DDTs and HCHs , respectively .	
23063733-4	The daily uptake of a pesticide by humans was calculated via the pesticide intake multiplied by its uptake efficiency .	2
23063733-5	The uptake efficiencies of DDTs and HCHs in food through human intestines were estimated using bioaccessibility measured via an in vitro method simulating the human gastrointestinal digestion process .	
23063733-6	The total daily uptakes of DDTs and HCHs through three routes ( i.e. , ingestion , inhalation , and dermal contact ) were 79.4 and 4.9 ng/day , respectively , for children , and 131.1 and 8.0 ng/day , respectively , for adults .	24 22 23 2 243 242
23063733-7	Ingestion via food and dust was the main route of human exposure to the pesticides , and the daily uptake of the pesticides via food consumption accounted for 95.0-99.2% of the total .	24 2 243 242
21831408-0	Measurements of cadmium ( Cd ) in air , soil and moss have shown elevated concentrations in residential areas close to a zinc smelter in Norway .	
21831408-1	This study aimed to evaluate whether men and women residing in the area with elevated Cd concentrations in air and soil had increased levels of Cd and microproteins in urine .	
21831408-2	An invitation to participate was mailed to 200 persons residing close to the zinc smelter and to 200 controls from an area more than 4 km away from the smelter .	
21831408-3	They were asked to complete a questionnaire , and to deliver a urine sample for analysis of cadmium ( CdU ) , mercury ( HgU ) , lead ( PbU ) and Î±1-microglobulin ( ProteinHC ) .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
21831408-4	Two hundred and six participants ( response rate 52% ) , between 19 and 88 years of age , were included .	
21831408-5	Results were analysed by multiple-adjusted linear and logistic regression .	
21831408-6	CdU was not significantly different between individuals in the two residence areas .	
21831408-7	Only ten individuals had CdU concentrations exceeding European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) critical value of 1 Î¼g/g creatinine , whereas 35 persons ( 22% of the women vs. 11% of the men ) had CdU concentrations higher than 0.66 Î¼g/g creatinine , which EU suggested to be sufficiently protective for the general population .	
21831408-8	Smoking was the predominant contributing factor to values of elevated CdU .	
21831408-9	There was a tendency of higher CdU , although not statistically significant , amongst people regularly consuming fruit , berries and vegetables grown in their own garden near the smelter area .	245 24 2 243
21831408-10	Home address in the polluted area was not a significant determinant .	
21831408-11	There was a positive correlation between CdU and ProteinHC in urine , but no significant difference was found for ProteinHC between residents from polluted area and controls .	
21831408-12	In spite of demonstrated industrial emissions of cadmium , the results do not indicate elevated cadmium exposure or kidney damage in the polluted area compared to the control area .	
16639901-0	Data on Polybrominated diphenylether ( PBDE ) concentrations in individual U.S. women were compiled .	
16639901-1	PBDE levels in adipose tissue , serum , and breast milk from individual U.S. women were found to follow similar lognormal distributions , which exhibited a high degree of variability .	1 121 122 12 124
16639901-2	The distribution of lipid-normalized PBDE concentrations for all media combined had a median of 47.9 ng/g and a 95th percentile estimate of 302 ng/g .	
16639901-3	Estimates of congener-specific kinetic parameters were used to calculate the total daily intake of the PBDEs ( sum of 5 PBDE prominent congeners , PBDE-47 , -99 , -100 , -153 , and -154 ) that would be required to achieve the measured body burdens .	2
16639901-4	PBDE intake estimates from all routes of exposure were 8.5 ng/kg/d ( median ) and 54 ng/kg/d ( 95th percentile ) .	2
16639901-5	The potential health risks posed by the PBDEs were examined by comparing 95th percentile tissue concentrations in humans ( C(human) ) to modeled and measured tissue concentrations in rodents that caused no developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive effects ( C(rodent) ) .	
16639901-6	The ratio of rodent-to-human PBDE concentrations ( C(rodent):C(human) ) was &lt;1 for alterations of male and female reproductive organs in rats , &lt;10 for neurodevelopmental effects in mice , and &lt;100 for neurodevelopmental effects in rats .	
16639901-7	If humans are as sensitive as animals to PBDE-induced developmental toxicity , the current margin of safety appears low for a fraction of the population .	
21830753-0	Prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) may disrupt thyroid function and contribute to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes .	
21830753-1	We conducted a pilot study to explore the relationship between serum concentrations of lower-brominated PBDEs ( BDE-17 to -154 ) , higher-brominated PBDEs ( BDE-183 to -209 ) , and hydroxylated PBDE metabolites ( OH-PBDEs ) with measures of thyroid function in pregnant women .	1 122 12
21830753-2	Concentrations of PBDEs , OH-PBDEs , thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , total thyroxine ( T(4) ) , and free T(4) were measured in serum samples collected between 2008 and 2009 from 25 second trimester pregnant women in California .	11 12 11122 1 122 11123 111 1112
21830753-3	Median concentrations of lower-brominated PBDEs and OH-PBDEs were the highest reported to date in pregnant women .	
21830753-4	Median concentrations of BDE-47 and the sum of lower-brominated PBDEs ( Î£PBDE(5) ) were 43.1 ng/g lipid and 85.8 ng/g lipid , respectively , and the sum of OH-PBDEs ( Î£OH-PBDE(4) ) was 0.084 ng/mL .	
21830753-5	We observed a positive association between the weighted sum of chemicals known to bind to transthyretin ( Î£TTR binders ) and TSH levels .	
21830753-6	We also found positive associations between TSH and Î£PBDE(5) , Î£OH-PBDE(4) , BDE-47 , BDE-85 , 5-OH-BDE47 , and 4'-OH-BDE49 , and an inverse association with BDE-207 .	
21830753-7	Relationships with free and total T(4) were weak and inconsistent .	
21830753-8	Our results indicate that PBDE exposures are elevated in pregnant women in California and suggest a relationship with thyroid function .	
21830753-9	Further investigation is warranted to characterize the risks of PBDE exposures during pregnancy .	
16696181-0	This study conducted in Bangladesh reports the relationship of clinical complications with nutritional status and the prevalence of leukopenia among arsenic exposed patients living in the rural villages .	
16696181-1	A total of 115 exposed individuals diagnosed as arsenicosis patients were randomly selected from four known arsenic endemic villages , and age-matched 120 unexposed subjects were enrolled in the study program .	
16696181-2	The duration of arsenic exposure in about 37% of the patients was at least 10 yrs , while the population mean and range were 7.6 +/- 5.2 yrs , and 1 - 25 yrs , respectively .	
16696181-3	The mean arsenic concentrations in the drinking water for the exposed and unexposed ( control ) population were 218.1 microg/L and 11.3 microg/L , respectively .	24 2 241
16696181-4	The spot urine sample of the arsenicosis patients contained an average of 234.6 microg/L arsenic .	1 12 127
16696181-5	Although very few patients showed elevated WBC count , 16% had leukopenia ( below normal count ) , and the whole population had significantly low WBC count than the control subjects .	1 11 1113 111
16696181-6	Prevalences of neutropenia and lymphocytosis were observed in patients with chronic exposure to high levels of arsenic in water .	11 24 1 1113 2 241 111
16696181-7	The body mass index was found to be lower than 18.5 , the cut-off point for malnutrition ( underweight ) , in about 28% of the arsenicosis cases compared to 15% of the controls .	
16696181-8	The monthly income and total calorie consumption per day showed the patients were underprivileged than the controls .	
16696181-9	Arsenical symptoms and complications were more severe in the nutritionally vulnerable ( underweight ) patients than the overweight ones .	
16696181-10	Also , the incidences of leukopenia and anaemia were more common in the female patients who were underweight .	
16696181-11	The findings of this research demonstrate that the poor nutritional status of patients increases the complications of chronic arsenic toxicity ; suggest the possibility of other sources of arsenic contamination different from drinking water in the study area ; and establish a higher prevalence of leukopenia and lymphocytosis in arsenicosis patients .	
16702122-0	The purpose of this case series is to assess long-term sequelae of arsenic exposure in a cohort acutely exposed to arsenic in drinking water from a well dug into a landfill containing arsenical pesticides .	24 2 241
16702122-1	Ten of the 13 individuals ( or next of kin ) in the initial study agreed to participate in the follow-up study .	
16702122-2	Next of kin provided questionnaire data and released medical information on the three individuals who had died .	
16702122-3	The remaining seven cohort members were assessed by an interview , questionnaire , detailed physical examination and sensory nerve testing .	1 11 112
16702122-4	Available medical records were obtained and reviewed .	
16702122-5	Sensory testing was performed using an automated electrodiagnostic sensory Nerve Conduction Threshold ( sNCT ) evaluation .	1 11 112
16702122-6	Sensory complaints and electrodiagnostic findings consistent with polyneuropathy were found in a minority ( 3/7 ) of subjects 28 years after an acute toxic arsenic exposure .	
16702122-7	Two of the seven patients examined ( 1 of 3 with neuropathic findings ) also had hyperkeratotic lesions consistent with arsenic toxicity and one of the patients had hyperpigmentation on their lower extremities possibly consistent with arsenic toxicity .	1 11 112
21820958-0	Thousands of Cambodia populations are currently at high risks of both toxic and carcinogenic effects through drinking arsenic-rich groundwater .	
21820958-1	In order to determine and assess the use of arsenic contents in different biological samples as biomarkers of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking arsenic-rich groundwater in Cambodia , individual scalp hair , fingernail and toenail were collected from three different provinces in the Mekong River basin of Cambodia .	1 12 123
21820958-2	After washing and acid-digestion , digestate was analyzed for total arsenic by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .	
21820958-3	Chemical analysis of the acid-digested hair revealed that among 270 hair samples cut from Kandal , 78.1% had arsenic content in scalp hair ( As(h) ) greater than the typical As(h) ( 1.00 Î¼g g(-1) ) , indicating possible arsenic toxicity .	1 123 12
21820958-4	Concurrently , 1.2% and 0.6% were found elevated in Kratie ( n=84 ) and Kampong Cham ( n=173 ) , respectively .	
21820958-5	Similarly , the upper end of the ranges for arsenic contents in fingernail ( As(fn) ) and toenail ( As(tn) ) clipped from Kandal ( fingernail n=241 ; toenail n=187 ) were higher than the normal arsenic content in nail ( 0.43-1.08 Î¼g g(-1) ) , however , none was observed elevated in both Kratie ( fingernail n=76 , toenail n=42 ) and Kampong Cham ( fingernail n=83 ; toenail n=52 ) .	1 123 12
21820958-6	Significant positive intercorrelations between groundwater arsenic concentration ( As(w) ) , average daily dose ( ADD ) of arsenic , As(h) , As(fn) and As(tn) suggest that As(h) , As(fn) and As(tn) can be used as biomarkers of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking arsenic-rich groundwater , in which As(h) is more favorable than As(fn) and As(tn) due to the ease of sample processing and analytical measurements , respectively .	24 2 241
21820740-0	Persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) present in the living environment are thought to have detrimental health effects on the population , with pregnant women and the developing foetus being at highest risk .	
21820740-1	We report on the levels of selected POPs in maternal blood of 155 delivering women residing in seven regions within the SÃ£o Paulo State , Brazil .	1 122 12
21820740-2	The following selected POPs were measured in the maternal whole blood : 12 polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) congeners ( IUPAC Nos. 99 , 101 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 156 , 163 , 170 , 180 , 183 , 187 , 194 ) ; dichlordiphenyltrichloroethane p,p'-DDT , diphenyldichloroethylene p,p'-DDE and other pesticides such as hexachlorocyclohexanes ( Î±-HCH , Î²-HCH , Î³-HCH ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , chlordane derivatives cis-chlordane , trans-chlordane , oxy-chlordane , cis-nonachlor and trans-nonachlor .	1 122 12
21820740-3	Statistical comparisons between regions were performed only on compounds having concentrations above LOD in 70% of the samples .	
21820740-4	PCB118 congener was found to be highest in the industrial site ( mean 4.97 ng/g lipids ) ; PCB138 congener concentration was highest in the Urban 3 site ( mean 4.27 ng/g lipids ) and congener PCB153 was highest in the industrial and Urban 3 sites with mean concentration of 7.2 ng/g lipids and 5.89ng/g lipids respectively .	
21820740-5	Large differences in levels of p,p'-DDE between regions were observed with the Urban 3 and industrial sites having the highest concentrations of 645 ng/g lipids and 417 ng/g lipids , respectively ; Î²-HCH was found to be highest in the Rural 1 site ; the Î³-HCH in Rural 1 and industrial ; the HCB in the Rural 1 and industrial sites and oxy-chlordane and t-NC in the Rural 2 sites .	
21820740-6	An association between levels of some contaminants and maternal age and parity was also found .	
22781436-0	Two deterministic models ( US EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs Residential Standard Operating Procedures ( OPP Residential SOPs ) and Draft Protocol for Measuring Children's Non-Occupational Exposure to Pesticides by all Relevant Pathways ( Draft Protocol) ) and four probabilistic models ( CARES(Â®) , Calendexâ¢ , ConsExpo , and SHEDS ) were used to estimate aggregate residential exposures to pesticides .	2
22781436-1	The route-specific exposure estimates for young children ( 2-5 years ) generated by each model were compared to evaluate data inputs , algorithms , and underlying assumptions .	2 22
22781436-2	Three indoor exposure scenarios were considered : crack and crevice , fogger , and flying insect killer .	
22781436-3	Dermal exposure estimates from the OPP Residential SOPs and the Draft Protocol were 4.75 and 2.37âmg/kg/day ( crack and crevice scenario ) and 0.73 and 0.36âmg/kg/day ( fogger ) , respectively .	2 22
22781436-4	The dermal exposure estimates ( 99th percentile ) for the crack and crevice scenario were 16.52 , 12.82 , 3.57 , and 3.30âmg/kg/day for CARES , Calendex , SHEDS , and ConsExpo , respectively .	2 22
22781436-5	Dermal exposure estimates for the fogger scenario from CARES and Calendex ( 1.50 and 1.47âmg/kg/day , respectively ) were slightly higher than those from SHEDS and ConsExpo ( 0.74 and 0.55âmg/kg/day , respectively ) .	
22781436-6	The ConsExpo derived non-dietary ingestion estimates ( 99th percentile ) under these two scenarios were higher than those from SHEDS , CARES , and Calendex .	24 2
22781436-7	All models produced extremely low exposure estimates for the flying insect killer scenario .	
22781436-8	Using similar data inputs , the model estimates by route for these scenarios were consistent and comparable .	
22781436-9	Most of the models predicted exposures within a factor of 5 at the 50th and 99th percentiles .	
22781436-10	The differences identified are explained by activity assumptions , input distributions , and exposure algorithms .	
22749975-0	Dermal exposure data for mycotoxins are very scarce and fragmentary , despite their widespread skin contact and hazard toxicity .	
22749975-1	In this study , the transdermal kinetics of aflatoxin B1 ( AFB1 ) , ochratoxin A ( OTA ) , fumonisin B1 ( FB1 ) , citrinin ( CIT ) , zearalenone ( ZEA ) and T-2 toxin ( T-2 ) were quantitatively evaluated , using human skin in an in vitro Franz diffusion cell set-up .	
22749975-2	All mycotoxins penetrated through the skin , except for FB1 , which showed concentrations in the receptor fluid below the LoD , resulting in a K(p)&lt;3.24Ã10(-6)cm/h .	
22749975-3	OTA showed the highest permeation ( K(p)=8.20Ã10(-4)cm/h ) , followed by CIT ( K(p)=4.67Ã10(-4)cm/h ) .	
22749975-4	AFB1 and ZEA showed lower permeability rates ( K(p)=2.11 and 2.33Ã10(-4)cm/h , respectively ) .	
22749975-5	T-2 was found to have the lowest permeability ( K(p)=6.07Ã10(-5)cm/h ) .	
22749975-6	From literature-based mycotoxin-concentrations , dermal contact surface , exposure time and apparent K(p)'s obtained in this study , the daily dermal exposure ( DDE ) in two industrial and one residential scenario was estimated .	2 22
22749975-7	Dermal exposure to the DNA-reactive genotoxic carcinogenic AFB1 can lead to a health risk for agricultural workers which are exposed to a mycotoxin contaminated solution in a worst case situation .	
22749975-8	For all the other investigated mycotoxins , no significant health risk is calculated after dermal contact in neither agricultural nor residential environments .	2 22
16688004-0	OBJECTIVE We sought to assess whether the metabolism of arsenic impacts a person's susceptibility to bladder cancer .	
16688004-1	METHODS Urinary methylation products were measured in subjects from Argentina ( 114 cases and 114 controls ) and the United States ( 23 cases and 49 controls ) .	1 12 127
16688004-2	RESULTS In Argentina , the adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) for subjects with a high proportion of ingested arsenic excreted as monomethylarsonate ( %MMA ) was 2.17 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.02-4.63 ) in smokers and 0.48 ( 95% CI = 0.17-1.33 ) in nonsmokers .	
16688004-3	In the United States , the adjusted ORs for high %MMA in subjects with arsenic intakes less than and greater than 100 microg/d were 1.20 ( 95% CI = 0.27-5.38 ) and 2.70 ( 95% CI = 0.39-18.6 ) .	2
16688004-4	CONCLUSIONS Overall , these results are consistent with data from Taiwan suggesting that some individuals who excrete a higher proportion of ingested arsenic as MMA are more susceptible to arsenic-related cancer .	
23376518-0	Many studies nowadays make the effort of determining personal exposure rather than estimating exposure at the residential address only .	
23376518-1	While intra-urban air pollution can be modeled quite easily using interpolation methods , estimating exposure in transport is more challenging .	
23376518-2	The aim of this study is to investigate which factors determine black carbon ( BC ) concentrations in transport microenvironments .	
23376518-3	Therefore personal exposure measurements are carried out using portable aethalometers , trip diaries and GPS devices .	2 233 23
23376518-4	More than 1500 trips , both by active modes and by motorized transport , are evaluated in Flanders , Belgium .	
23376518-5	GPS coordinates are assigned to road segments to allow BC concentrations to be linked with trip and road characteristics ( trip duration , degree of urbanization , road type , traffic intensity , travel speed and road speed ) .	
23376518-6	Average BC concentrations on highways ( 10.7Î¼g/m(3) ) are comparable to concentrations on urban roads ( 9.6Î¼g/m(3) ) , but levels are significantly higher than concentrations on rural roads ( 6.1Î¼g/m(3) ) .	
23376518-7	Highways yield higher BC exposures for motorists compared to exposure on major roads and local roads .	
23376518-8	Overall BC concentrations are elevated at lower speeds ( &lt;30km/h ) and at speeds above 80km/h , in accordance to vehicle emission functions .	
23376518-9	Driving on roads with low traffic intensities resulted in lower exposures than driving on roads with higher traffic intensities ( from 5.6Î¼g/m(3) for roads with less than 500veh/h , up to 12Î¼g/m(3) for roads with over 2500veh/h ) .	
23376518-10	Traffic intensity proved to be the major explanatory variable for in-vehicle BC exposure , together with timing of the trip and urbanization .	
23376518-11	For cyclists and pedestrians the range in BC exposure is smaller and models are less predictive ; for active modes exposure seems to be influenced by timing and degree of urbanization only .	
19337525-0	BACKGROUND Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between acute exposure to ambient fine particles and both mortality and morbidity .	
19337525-1	Less is known about the relative impacts of the specific chemical constituents of particulate matter&lt;2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM2.5 ) on hospital admissions .	
19337525-2	OBJECTIVE This study was designed to estimate the risks of exposure to PM2.5 and several species on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children .	
19337525-3	DATA AND METHODS We obtained data on daily counts of hospitalizations for children&lt;19 and &lt;5 years of age for total respiratory diseases and several subcategories including pneumonia , acute bronchitis , and asthma for six California counties from 2000 through 2003 , as well as ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and its constituents , including elemental carbon ( EC ) , organic carbon ( OC ) , and nitrates ( NO3 ) .	2 231 23
19337525-4	We used Poisson regression to estimate risks while controlling for important covariates .	
19337525-5	RESULTS We observed associations between several components of PM2.5 and hospitalization for all of the respiratory outcomes examined .	
19337525-6	For example , for total respiratory admissions for children&lt;19 years of age , the interquartile range for a 3-day lag of PM2.5 , EC , OC , NO3 , and sulfates was associated with an excess risk of 4.1% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.8-6.4 ] , 5.4% ( 95% CI , 0.8-10.3 ) , 3.4% ( 95% CI , 1.1-5.7 ) , 3.3% ( 95% CI , 1.1-5.5 ) , and 3.0% ( 95% CI , 0.4-5.7 ) , respectively .	2 231 23
19337525-7	We also observed associations for several metals .	
19337525-8	Additional associations with several of the species , including potassium , were observed in the cool season .	
19337525-9	CONCLUSION Components of PM2.5 were associated with hospitalization for several childhood respiratory diseases including pneumonia , bronchitis , and asthma .	
19337525-10	Because exposure to components ( e.g. , EC , OC , NO3 , and K ) and their related sources , including diesel and gasoline exhaust , wood smoke , and other combustion sources , are ubiquitous in the urban environment , it likely represents an identifiable and preventable risk factor for hospitalization for children .	
12948892-0	Studies have suggested that children living close to busy roads may have impaired respiratory health .	
12948892-1	This study was designed to test the hypothesis that exposure to exhaust from heavy traffic in particular is related to childhood respiratory health .	
12948892-2	Children attending 24 schools located within 400 m from busy motorways were investigated .	
12948892-3	The motorways carried between 5,190 and 22,326 trucks per weekday and between 30,399 and 155,656 cars per day .	
12948892-4	Locations were chosen so that the correlation between truck and car traffic counts was low .	
12948892-5	Air pollution measurements were performed at the schools for 1 year .	2 232 23
12948892-6	Respiratory symptoms were collected by parent-completed questionnaire .	
12948892-7	Sensitization to common allergens was measured by serum immunoglobulin E and skin prick tests .	11 1 11123 111 1112
12948892-8	Bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) was measured with a hypertonic saline challenge .	1 11 112
12948892-9	Respiratory symptoms were increased near motorways with high truck but not high car traffic counts .	
12948892-10	They were also related to air pollutants that increased near motorways with high truck traffic counts .	
12948892-11	Lung function and BHR were not related to pollution .	
12948892-12	Sensitization to pollen increased in relation to truck but not car traffic counts .	
12948892-13	The relation between symptoms and measures of exposure to ( truck ) traffic-related air pollution were almost entirely restricted to children with BHR and/or sensitization to common allergens , indicating that these are a sensitive subgroup among all children for these effects .	2 23
19337527-0	BACKGROUND Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) are persistent , bioaccumulative , and toxic pollutants that were broadly used in the United States until the 1970s .	
19337527-1	Common exposure to PCBs , DDT , and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE ) , the most stable metabolite of DDT , may influence children's neurodevelopment , but study results are not consistent .	
19337527-2	OBJECTIVES We examined the associations between lactational exposure to PCBs , DDT , and DDE and infant development at 12 months , using data from the Pregnancy , Infection , and Nutrition Babies Study , 2004-2006 .	1 11 112
19337527-3	METHODS We measured PCBs , DDT , and DDE in breast milk at the third month postpartum .	1 12 124
19337527-4	Lactational exposure of these chemicals was estimated by the product of chemical concentrations and the duration of breast-feeding .	24 2 243
19337527-5	Infant development at 12 months of age was measured by the Mullen Scales of Early Learning ( n=231 ) and the Short Form : Level I ( infant ) of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Indices ( n=218 ) .	1 11 112
19337527-6	RESULTS No consistent associations were observed between lactational exposure to PCBs , DDT , and DDE through the first 12 months and the measures of infant development .	
19337527-7	However , DDE was associated with scoring below average on the gross motor scale of the Mullen among males only ( adjusted odds ratio=1.9 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.1-3.3 ) .	1 11 112
19337527-8	CONCLUSION Infant neurodevelopment at 12 months of age was not impaired by PCBs , DDT , and DDE at the concentrations measured here , in combination with benefits from long duration of breast-feeding in this population .	
23384763-0	Systematic characterization of morphological , mineralogical , chemical and toxicological properties of various size fractions of the atmospheric particulate matter was a main focus of this study together with an assessment of the human health risks they pose .	
23384763-1	Even though near-ground atmospheric aerosols have been a subject of intensive research in recent years , data integrating chemical composition of particles and health risks are still scarce and the particle size aspect has not been properly addressed yet .	
23384763-2	Filling this gap , however , is necessary for reliable risk assessment .	
23384763-3	A high volume ambient air sampler equipped with a multi-stage cascade impactor was used for size specific particle collection , and all 6 fractions were a subject of detailed characterization of chemical ( PAHs ) and mineralogical composition of the particles , their mass size distribution and genotoxic potential of organic extracts .	
23384763-4	Finally , the risk level for inhalation exposure associated to the carcinogenic character of the studied PAHs has been assessed .	2 23
23384763-5	The finest fraction ( &lt;0.45 Î¼m ) exhibited the highest mass , highest active surface , highest amount of associated PAHs and also highest direct and indirect genotoxic potentials in our model air sample .	
23384763-6	Risk assessment of inhalation scenario indicates the significant cancer risk values in PM 1.5 size fraction .	2 23
23384763-7	This presented new approach proved to be a useful tool for human health risk assessment in the areas with significant levels of air dust concentration .	
12896852-0	Daily measures of maximum temperature , particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micro m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM10 ) , and gaseous pollution ( ozone , nitrogen dioxide , sulfur dioxide , and carbon monoxide ) were collected in Denver , Colorado , in July and August between 1993 and 1997 .	2 23
12896852-1	We then compared these exposures with concurrent data on the number of daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases in men and women &gt ; 65 years of age .	
12896852-2	Generalized linear models , assuming a Poisson error structure for the selected cardiovascular disease hospital admissions , were constructed to evaluate the associations with air pollution and temperature .	2 23
12896852-3	After adjusting the admission data for yearly trends , day-of-week effects , ambient maximum temperature , and dew point temperature , we studied the associations of the pollutants in single-pollutant models with lag times of 0-4 days .	2 231 23
12896852-4	The results suggest that O3 is associated with an increase in the risk of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction , coronary atherosclerosis , and pulmonary heart disease .	
12896852-5	SO2 appears to be related to increased hospital stays for cardiac dysrhythmias , and CO is significantly associated with congestive heart failure .	
12896852-6	No association was found between particulate matter or NO2 and any of the health outcomes .	
12896852-7	Males tend to have higher numbers of hospital admissions than do females for all of the selected cardiovascular diseases , except for congestive heart failure .	
12896852-8	Higher temperatures appear to be an important factor in increasing the frequency of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure , and are associated with a decrease in the frequency of visits for coronary atherosclerosis and pulmonary heart disease .	
18221981-0	The sinking of the ' Prestige ' oil tanker in front of the Galician coast ( NW of Spain ) in November 2002 offered a unique opportunity to analyze intermediate cytogenetic and endocrine effects among people exposed to the complex mixture of substances that oil constitutes , including several toxic heavy metals .	
18221981-1	In this work we evaluated the relationship between exposure to heavy metals ( blood concentrations of aluminium , cadmium , nickel , lead and zinc ) and genotoxic parameters ( sister chromatid exchanges , micronucleus test and comet assay ) or endocrine parameters ( plasmatic concentrations of prolactin and cortisol ) in subjects exposed to ' Prestige ' oil during cleaning tasks developed after the spillage .	11 1111 12 1 11121 122 11123 111 1112
18221981-2	Concentrations of lead were significantly related to the comet assay even after adjusting by age , sex and smoking .	
18221981-3	Cortisol concentrations were significantly influenced by aluminium , nickel ( both , inversely ) and cadmium ( positively ) .	
18221981-4	Women had clearly higher concentrations of prolactin and cortisol , even when adjusting by age , smoking , cadmium , aluminium or nickel .	
18221981-5	Plasmatic cortisol was jointly influenced by gender , smoking and aluminium or nickel ( all p&lt;0.05 ) .	
18221981-6	In women there was a strong relationship between concentrations of cadmium and prolactin ( beta=0.37 , p=0.031 ) .	
18221981-7	When the effects of cadmium , aluminium and nickel on cortisol were simultaneously assessed , only the latter two metals remained statistically significant .	
18221981-8	Among parameters analysed , cortisol appeared to be the most sensitive to the effects of metal exposure .	
18221981-9	Plasma levels of cortisol deserve further evaluation as a potentially relevant biomarker to assess the effects of exposure to heavy metals .	11 1
19440495-0	BACKGROUND Environmental exposure to some persistent organic pollutants has been reported to be associated with a metabolic syndrome in the U.S. population .	
19440495-1	OBJECTIVES We evaluated the associations of body burden levels of dioxins and related compounds with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the general population in Japan .	
19440495-2	METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study with 1,374 participants not occupationally exposed to these pollutants , living throughout Japan during 2002-2006 .	
19440495-3	In fasting blood samples , we measured biochemical factors and determined lipid-adjusted concentrations of 10 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , 7 polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , and 12 dioxin-like poly-chlorinated biphenyls ( DL-PCBs ) all of which have toxic equivalency factors .	1 122 12
19440495-4	We also performed a questionnaire survey .	
19440495-5	RESULTS The toxic equivalents ( TEQs ) of PCDDs , PCDFs , and DL-PCBs and total TEQs had significant adjusted associations with metabolic syndrome , whether or not we excluded diabetic subjects .	
19440495-6	By analyzing each component of metabolic syndrome separately , the DL-PCB TEQs and total TEQs were associated with all components , and the odds ratios ( ORs ) in the highest quartile of DL-PCB TEQs in four of the five components were higher than those for PCDDs or PCDFs .	
19440495-7	We also found congener-specific associations with metabolic syndrome ; in particular , the highest quartiles of PCB-126 and PCB-105 had adjusted ORs of 9.1 and 7.3 , respectively .	
19440495-8	CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that body burden levels of dioxins and related compounds , particularly those of DL-PCBs , are associated with metabolic syndrome .	1 11 112
19440495-9	Of the components , high blood pressure , elevated triglycerides , and glucose intolerance were most closely associated with these pollutants .	11 1 11121 1112 111 112
23403144-0	Asian dust storm ( ADS ) events have raised concerns regarding their adverse impact on human health .	
23403144-1	Whether ADS events can result in the heterogeneity of health impacts on children across space and time has not been studied .	
23403144-2	The goal of this study is to examine the spatial vulnerability impact of ADS events on children's respiratory health geographically and to analyze any patterns related to ADS episodes .	2 231 23
23403144-3	From 1998 to 2007 , data from both preschool children's and schoolchildren's daily respiratory clinic visits , gathered from patients located in 41 districts of Taipei City and New Taipei City , are analyzed in a Bayesian spatiotemporal model in order to investigate the interaction between spatial effects and ADS episodes .	2 231 23
23403144-4	When adjusting for the temporal effect , air pollutants , and temperature , the spatial pattern explicitly varies during defined study periods : non-ADS periods , ADS periods , and post-ADS periods .	
23403144-5	Compared to non-ADS periods , the relative rate of children's respiratory clinic visits significantly reduced 0.74 to 0.99 times in most districts during ADS periods , while the relative rate rose from 1.01 to 1.11 times in more than half of districts during post-ADS periods , especially in schoolchildren .	
23403144-6	This spatial vulnerability denotes that the significantly increased relative rate of respiratory clinic visits during post-ADS periods is primarily located in highly urbanized areas for both children's populations .	
23403144-7	Hence , the results of this study suggest that schoolchildren are particularly more vulnerable to the health impacts of ADS exposure in terms of higher excessive risks over a larger spatial extent than preschool children , especially during post-ADS periods .	
12854696-0	Blood lead data for a childhood lead exposure study have been reanalyzed to examine the impact of carpets on the effectiveness of a cleaning intervention in 39 New Jersey urban houses .	1 122 12
12854696-1	All eligible houses in the study were classified as carpeted and uncarpeted depending on the number of rooms that were carpeted .	
12854696-2	The cleaning protocol was associated with a significant reduction in the blood lead concentrations for the uncarpeted homes ( P = 0.004 ) , whereas no significant change was found for the carpeted homes ( P = 0.566 ) .	1 122 12
12854696-3	We also completed correlation analyses between the number of cleaning visits and the percentage reduction in blood lead for the carpeted/uncarpeted houses .	
12854696-4	There was a significant correlation ( r = 0.67 ) between the number of cleanings and blood lead reduction for the uncarpeted homes , but no correlation ( r = 0.04 ) for the carpeted homes .	
12854696-5	In a multiple regression model that took confounding variables into account , the carpet status ( carpeted or uncarpeted ) remained a factor of the effect of cleaning on blood lead ( P = 0.05 ) .	
12854696-6	We conclude that the presence of contaminated carpets inhibits the effectiveness of home cleaning despite a high-efficiency particulate air filtered vacuum protocol that removes a substantial amount of lead dust .	
23425550-0	BACKGROUND Few studies have evaluated health impacts , especially biomarker changes , following implementation of a new environmental policy .	
23425550-1	This study examined changes in water fluoride , urinary fluoride ( UF ) , and bone metabolism indicators in children after supplying low fluoride public water in endemic fluorosis areas of Southern China .	24 12 1 2 241 127
23425550-2	We also assessed the relationship between UF and serum osteocalcin ( BGP ) , calcitonin ( CT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , and bone mineral density to identify the most sensitive bone metabolism indicators related to fluoride exposure .	11 1 11123 111 112 1112
23425550-3	METHODS Four fluorosis-endemic villages ( intervention villages ) in Guangdong , China were randomly selected to receive low-fluoride water .	
23425550-4	One non-endemic fluorosis village with similar socio-economic status , living conditions , and health care access , was selected as the control group. 120 children aged 6-12 years old were randomly chosen from local schools in each village for the study .	
23425550-5	Water and urinary fluoride content as well as serum BGP , CT , ALP and bone mineral density were measured by the standard methods and compared between the children residing in the intervention villages and the control village .	24 12 1 2 241 127
23425550-6	Benchmark dose ( BMD ) and benchmark dose lower limit ( BMDL ) were calculated for each bone damage indicator .	
23425550-7	RESULTS Our study found that after water source change , fluoride concentrations in drinking water in all intervention villages ( A-D ) were significantly reduced to 0.11 mg/l , similar to that in the control village ( E ) .	24 2 241
23425550-8	Except for Village A where water change has only been taken place for 6 years , urinary fluoride concentrations in children of the intervention villages were lower or comparable to those in the control village after 10 years of supplying new public water .	1 12 127
23425550-9	The values of almost all bone indicators in children living in Villages B-D and ALP in Village A were either lower or similar to those in the control village after the intervention .	
23425550-10	CT and BGP are sensitive bone metabolism indicators related to UF .	
23425550-11	While assessing the temporal trend of different abnormal bone indicators after the intervention , bone mineral density showed the most stable and the lowest abnormal rates over time .	
23425550-12	CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that supplying low fluoride public water in Southern China is successful as measured by the reduction of fluoride in water and urine , and changes in various bone indicators to normal levels .	
23425550-13	A comparison of four bone indicators showed CT and BGP to be the most sensitive indicators .	
19440504-0	BACKGROUND Determining arsenic exposure in groups based on geographic location , dietary behaviors , or lifestyles is important , as even moderate exposures may lead to health concerns .	
19440504-1	OBJECTIVES/METHODS The Korean community in Washington State , represents a group warranting investigation , as they consume foods ( e.g. , shellfish , rice , finfish , and seaweed ) known to contain arsenic .	
19440504-2	As part of the Arsenic Mercury Intake Biometric Study , we examined the arsenic levels in hair and urine along with the diets of 108 women of childbearing age from within this community .	1 123 12 127
19440504-3	Arsenic levels in indoor air and drinking water were also investigated , and shellfish commonly consumed were collected and analyzed for total and speciated arsenic .	24 23 2 241 243 232
19440504-4	RESULTS The six shellfish species analyzed ( n = 667 ) contain total arsenic ( range , 1-5 microg/g ) but are a small source of inorganic arsenic ( range , 0.01-0.12 microg/g ) .	
19440504-5	Six percent of the individuals may have elevated urinary inorganic arsenic levels ( &gt ; 10 microg/L ) due to diet .	1 12 127
19440504-6	Seaweed , rice , shellfish , and finfish are principal sources for total arsenic intake/excretion based on mass balance estimates .	
19440504-7	Rice consumption ( 163 g/person/day ) may be a significant source of inorganic arsenic .	24 2 243
19440504-8	Air and water are not significant sources of exposure .	
19440504-9	Hair is a poor biometric for examining arsenic levels at low to moderate exposures .	
19440504-10	CONCLUSIONS We conclude that a portion of this community may have dietary inorganic arsenic exposure resulting in urine levels exceeding 10 microg/L .	
19440504-11	Although their exposure is below that associated with populations exposed to high levels of arsenic from drinking water ( &gt ; 100 microg/L ) , their exposure may be among the highest in the United States .	
12854688-0	OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate the health status of nearby residents of a wood treatment plant who had sustained prolonged low-level environmental exposure to wood processing waste chemicals .	
12854688-1	METHODS A population of 1269 exposed residents who were plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the wood treatment plant were evaluated by questionnaire for a health history and symptoms .	
12854688-2	A representative sample of 214 exposed subjects was included in the analysis .	
12854688-3	One hundred thirty-nine controls were selected from 479 unexposed volunteers and matched to the exposed subjects as closely as possible by gender and age .	
12854688-4	Subjects and controls completed additional questionnaires and were evaluated by a physician for medical history and physical examination , blood and urine testing , neurophysiological and neuropsychological studies , and respiratory testing .	
12854688-5	Environmental sampling for wood processing waste chemicals was carried out on soil and drainage ditch sediment in the exposed neighborhood .	245 24 2
12854688-6	RESULTS The exposed subjects had significantly more cancer , respiratory , skin , and neurological health problems than the controls .	
12854688-7	The subjective responses on questionnaires and by physician histories revealed that the residents had a significantly greater prevalence of mucous membrane irritation , and skin and neurological symptoms , as well as cancer .	
12854688-8	( Exposed versus unexposed , cancer 10.0% versus 2.08% , bronchitis 17.8% versus 5.8% , and asthma by history 40.5% versus 11.0% ) There were significantly more neurophysiologic abnormalities in adults of reaction time , trails A and B , and visual field defects .	
12854688-9	CONCLUSIONS Adverse health effects were significantly more prevalent in long-term residents near a wood treatment plant than in controls .	
12854688-10	The results of this study suggest that plant emissions from wood treatment facilities should be reduced .	
12842772-0	Short-term changes in ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters &lt ; 10 micro m ( PM10 ) have been associated with short-term fluctuations in mortality or morbidity in many studies .	
12842772-1	In this study , we tested whether those deaths are just advanced by a few days or weeks using a multicity hierarchical modeling approach for all-cause , respiratory , and cardiovascular deaths , for all ages and stratifying by age groups , within the APHEA-2 ( Air Pollution and Health : A European Approach ) project .	
12842772-2	We fit a Poisson regression and used an unconstrained distributed lag to model the effect of PM10 exposure on deaths up to 40 days after the exposure .	2 231 23
12842772-3	In baseline models using PM10 the day of and day before the death , we found that the overall PM10 effect ( per 10 micro g/m3 ) was 0.74% [ 95% confidence interval ( 95% CI ) , -0.17 to 1.66 ] for respiratory deaths and 0.69% ( 95% CI , 0.31-1.08 ) for cardiovascular deaths .	2 231 23
12842772-4	In unrestricted distributed lag models , the effect estimates increased to 4.2% ( 95% CI , 1.08-7.42 ) for respiratory deaths and to 1.97% ( 95% CI , 1.38-2.55 ) for cardiovascular deaths .	
12842772-5	Our study confirms that most of the effect of air pollution is not simply advanced by a few weeks and that effects persist for more than a month after exposure .	2 23
12842772-6	The effect size estimate for PM10 doubles when we considered longer-term effects for all deaths and for cardiovascular deaths and becomes five times higher for respiratory deaths .	
12842772-7	We found similar effects when stratifying by age groups .	
12842772-8	These larger effects are important for risk assessment .	
18197306-0	BACKGROUND Recent studies have identified associations between the concentration of phthalates in indoor dust and allergic symptoms in the airways , nose , and skin .	
18197306-1	OBJECTIVES Our goal was to investigate the associations between allergic symptoms in children and the concentration of phthalate esters in settled dust collected from children's homes in Sofia and Burgas , Bulgaria .	24 2 242
18197306-2	METHODS Dust samples from the child's bedroom were collected .	24 2 242
18197306-3	A total of 102 children ( 2-7 years of age ) had symptoms of wheezing , rhinitis , and/or eczema in preceding 12 months ( cases ) , and 82 were nonsymptomatic ( controls ) .	
18197306-4	The dust samples were analyzed for their content of dimethyl phthalate ( DMP ) , diethyl phthalate ( DEP ) , di-n-butyl phthalate ( DnBP ) , butyl benzyl phthalate ( BBzP ) , di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) , and di-n-octyl phthalate ( DnOP ) .	24 2 242
18197306-5	RESULTS A higher concentration of DEHP was found in homes of case children than in those of controls ( 1.24 vs. 0.86 mg/g dust ) .	
18197306-6	The concentration of DEHP was significantly associated with wheezing in the preceding 12 months ( p = 0.035 ) as reported by parents .	
18197306-7	We found a dose-response relationship between DEHP concentration and case status and between DEHP concentration and wheezing in the preceding 12 months .	
18197306-8	CONCLUSIONS This study shows an association between concentration of DEHP in indoor dust and wheezing among preschool children in Bulgaria .	24 2 242
12804519-0	Sampling of multiple strata , or hierarchical sampling of various exposure sources and activity areas , has been tested and is suggested as a method to sample ( or to locate ) areas with a high prevalence of elevated blood lead in children .	
12804519-1	Hierarchical sampling was devised to supplement traditional soil lead sampling of a single stratum , either residential or fixed point source , using a multistep strategy .	
12804519-2	Blood lead ( n=1141 ) and soil lead ( n=378 ) data collected under the USEPA/UCI Tijuana Lead Project ( 1996-1999 ) were analyzed to evaluate the usefulness of sampling soil lead from background sites , schools and parks , point sources , and residences .	24 245 12 1 122 2
12804519-3	Results revealed that industrial emissions have been a contributing factor to soil lead contamination in Tijuana .	
12804519-4	At the regional level , point source soil lead was associated with mean blood lead levels and concurrent high background , and point source soil lead levels were predictive of a high percentage of subjects with blood lead equal to or greater than 10 micro g/dL ( pe 10 ) .	24 245 12 1 122 2
12804519-5	Significant relationships were observed between mean blood lead level and fixed point source soil lead ( r=0.93 ; P&lt;0.05 ; R(2)=0.72 using a quadratic model ) and between residential soil lead and fixed point source soil lead ( r=0.90 ; P&lt;0.05 ; R(2)=0.86 using a cubic model ) .	245 24 2
12804519-6	This study suggests that point sources alone are not sufficient for predicting the relative risk of exposure to lead in the urban environment .	
12804519-7	These findings will be useful in defining regions for targeted or universal soil lead sampling by site type .	
12804519-8	Point sources have been observed to be predictive of mean blood lead at the regional level ; however , this relationship alone was not sufficient to predict pe 10 .	
12804519-9	It is concluded that when apparently undisturbed sites reveal high soil lead levels in addition to local point sources , dispersion of lead is widespread and will be associated with a high prevalence of elevated blood lead in children .	
12804519-10	Multiple strata sampling was shown to be useful in differentiating among sources by site-specific association to mean blood lead and the prevalence of elevated blood lead at the regional level .	
18197299-0	INTRODUCTION Cadmium induces hypertension in animal models .	
18197299-1	Epidemiologic studies of cadmium exposure and hypertension , however , have been inconsistent .	
18197299-2	OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the association of blood and urine cadmium with blood pressure levels and with the prevalence of hypertension in U.S. adults who participated in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) .	11 12 112 1 122 127
18197299-3	METHODS We studied participants &gt ; or = 20 years of age with determinations of cadmium in blood ( n = 10,991 ) and urine ( n = 3,496 ) .	
18197299-4	Blood and urine cadmium were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry , respectively .	
18197299-5	Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were measured using a standardized protocol .	
18197299-6	RESULTS The geometric means of blood and urine cadmium were 3.77 nmol/L and 2.46 nmol/L , respectively .	
18197299-7	After multivariable adjustment , the average differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure comparing participants in the 90th vs. 10th percentile of the blood cadmium distribution were 1.36 mmHg [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , -0.28 to 3.00 ] and 1.68 mmHg ( 95% CI , 0.57-2.78 ) , respectively .	1 11 112
18197299-8	The corresponding differences were 2.35 mmHg and 3.27 mmHg among never smokers , 1.69 mmHg and 1.55 mmHg among former smokers , and 0.02 mmHg and 0.69 mmHg among current smokers .	
18197299-9	No association was observed for urine cadmium with blood pressure levels , or for blood and urine cadmium with the prevalence of hypertension .	
18197299-10	CONCLUSIONS Cadmium levels in blood , but not in urine , were associated with a modest elevation in blood pressure levels .	
18197299-11	The association was stronger among never smokers , intermediate among former smokers , and small or null among current smokers .	
18197299-12	Our findings add to the concern of renal and cardiovascular cadmium toxicity at chronic low levels of exposure in the general population .	
18197297-0	BACKGROUND Bisphenol A ( BPA ) and 4-tertiary-octylphenol ( tOP ) are industrial chemicals used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins ( BPA ) and nonionic surfactants ( tOP ) .	
18197297-1	These products are in widespread use in the United States .	
18197297-2	OBJECTIVES We aimed to assess exposure to BPA and tOP in the U.S. general population .	
18197297-3	METHODS We measured the total ( free plus conjugated ) urinary concentrations of BPA and tOP in 2,517 participants &gt ; or = 6 years of age in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using automated solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .	1 12 127
18197297-4	RESULTS BPA and tOP were detected in 92.6% and 57.4% of the persons , respectively .	
18197297-5	Least square geometric mean ( LSGM ) concentrations of BPA were significantly lower in Mexican Americans than in non-Hispanic blacks ( p = 0.006 ) and non-Hispanic whites ( p = 0.007 ) ; LSGM concentrations for non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites were not statistically different ( p = 0.21 ) .	
18197297-6	Females had statistically higher BPA LSGM concentrations than males ( p = 0.043 ) .	
18197297-7	Children had higher concentrations than adolescents ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) , who in turn had higher concentrations than adults ( p = 0.003 ) .	1 12 127
18197297-8	LSGM concentrations were lowest for participants in the high household income category ( &gt ; $45,000/year ) .	
18197297-9	CONCLUSIONS Urine concentrations of total BPA differed by race/ethnicity , age , sex , and household income .	1 12 127
18197297-10	These first U.S. population representative concentration data for urinary BPA and tOP should help guide public health research priorities , including studies of exposure pathways , potential health effects , and risk assessment .	
23454109-0	Toxicological studies showed that trihalomethanes ( THMs ) , the most abundant classes of disinfection by-products ( DBPs ) in drinking water , impaired male reproductive health , but epidemiological evidence is limited and inconsistent .	
23454109-1	This study aimed to examine the associations of baseline blood THMs with semen parameters and serum total testosterone in a Chinese population .	11 12 1 11121 122 1112 111 112
23454109-2	We recruited 401 men seeking semen examination from the Reproductive Center of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan , China between April 2011 and May 2012 .	
23454109-3	Baseline blood concentrations of THMs , including chloroform ( TCM ) , bromodichloromethane ( BDCM ) , dibromochloromethane ( DBCM ) , and bromoform ( TBM ) were measured using SPME-GC/ECD method .	1 122 12
23454109-4	Semen quality and serum total testosterone were analyzed .	1 11 112
23454109-5	Multivariable linear regressions were used to assess the associations of baseline blood THM concentrations with semen parameters and serum total testosterone levels .	11 1 1112 111 11121
23454109-6	We found that baseline blood THM concentrations were not associated with decrements in sperm motility , sperm straight-line and curvilinear velocity .	1 11 112
23454109-7	However , moderate levels of BDCM ( Î²=-0.13 million ; 95% CI : -0.22 , -0.03 ) and DBCM ( Î²=-4.74% ; 95% CI : -8.07 , -1.42 ) were associated with decreased sperm count and declined sperm linearity compared with low levels , respectively .	1 11 112
23454109-8	Suggestive dose-response relationships were also observed between elevated blood TCM or â THMs ( sum of TCM , BDCM , DBCM and TBM ) concentration and decreased sperm concentration ( both p for trend=0.07 ) , and between elevated blood DBCM concentration and decreased serum total testosterone ( p for trend=0.07 ) .	1 122 12
23454109-9	Our results indicate that elevated THM exposure may lead to decreased sperm concentration and serum total testosterone .	
23454109-10	However , the effects of THM exposure on male reproductive health still warrant further studies in humans .	
18191173-0	A field survey was carried on in GyÃ¶ngyÃ¶soroszi , Hungary , near to an abandoned lead/zinc mine to analyse the metal contamination of flooded and non-flooded vegetable gardens , and to evaluate the health risks to local population .	
18191173-1	Contamination levels of arsenic , cadmium , lead , mercury and zinc were measured in soil and homegrown vegetable samples and bioconcentration factors and hazard indices were calculated .	
18191173-2	The high metal contents of flooded vegetable gardens were caused by floods , the results indicated significant differences between flooded and non-flooded vegetable gardens .	
18191173-3	The most accumulating vegetable was sorrel , the most mobile elements were cadmium and lead .	
18191173-4	Arsenic was not available for vegetables .	
18191173-5	The health risk was calculated for two exposure routes : ingestion of soil and ingestion of vegetables .	245 24 2 243
18191173-6	The site-specific exposure parameters were established after a population based survey and a special equation was created to calculate the health risk due to homegrown vegetable consumption .	24 2 243
18191173-7	The highest risk was associated with ingestion of vegetables , the most hazardous element being lead .	24 2 243
18191173-8	The hazard index did not exceed the threshold value of one in flooded or non-flooded gardens .	
18191173-9	The analyses of health risk indicated that despite the high metal concentrations of soil the contamination of vegetable gardens does not pose an unacceptable risk to the inhabitants of the village .	
23461863-0	BACKGROUND There is interest in using residential dust to estimate human exposure to environmental contaminants .	
23461863-1	OBJECTIVES We aimed to characterize the sources of variability for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) in residential dust and provide guidance for investigators who plan to use residential dust to assess exposure to PAHs .	24 2 242
23461863-2	METHODS We collected repeat dust samples from 293 households in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during two sampling rounds ( from 2001 through 2007 and during 2010 ) using household vacuum cleaners , and measured 12 PAHs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry .	24 2 242
23461863-3	We used a random- and a mixed-effects model for each PAH to apportion observed variance into four components and to identify sources of variability .	
23461863-4	RESULTS Median concentrations for individual PAHs ranged from 10 to 190 ng/g of dust .	
23461863-5	For each PAH , total variance was apportioned into regional variability ( 1-9% ) , intraregional between-household variability ( 24-48% ) , within-household variability over time ( 41-57% ) , and within-sample analytical variability ( 2-33% ) .	
23461863-6	Regional differences in PAH dust levels were associated with estimated ambient air concentrations of PAH .	24 2 242
23461863-7	Intraregional differences between households were associated with the residential construction date and the smoking habits of residents .	
23461863-8	For some PAHs , a decreasing time trend explained a modest fraction of the within-household variability ; however , most of the within-household variability was unaccounted for by our mixed-effects models .	
23461863-9	Within-household differences between sampling rounds were largest when the interval between dust sample collections was at least 6 years in duration .	24 2 242
23461863-10	CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that it may be feasible to use residential dust for retrospective assessment of PAH exposures in studies of health effects .	
12782495-0	We analyzed data from a prospective study of menstrual cycle function and early pregnancy loss to explore further the effects of trihalomethanes ( THM ) on reproductive end points .	
12782495-1	Premenopausal women ( (italic)n(/italic) = 403 ) collected urine samples daily during an average of 5.6 cycles for measurement of steroid metabolites that were used to define menstrual parameters such as cycle and phase length .	11 1 127 12 112
12782495-2	Women were asked about consumption of various types of water as well as other habits and demographics .	24 2 241
12782495-3	A THM level was estimated for each cycle based on residence and quarterly measurements made by water utilities during a 90-day period beginning 60 days before the cycle start date .	
12782495-4	We found a monotonic decrease in mean cycle length with increasing total THM ( TTHM ) level ; at &gt ; 60 microg/L , the adjusted decrement was 1.1 days [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , -1.8 to -0.40 ] , compared with less than or equal to 40 microg/L .	
12782495-5	This finding was also reflected as a reduced follicular phase length ( difference -0.94 day ; 95% CI , -1.6 to -0.24 ) .	
12782495-6	A decrement in cycle and follicular phase length of 0.18 days ( 95% CI , -0.29 to -0.07 ) per 10 microg/L unit increase in TTHM concentration was found .	1 11 112
12782495-7	There was little association with luteal phase length , menses length , or cycle variability .	1 11 112
12782495-8	Examining the individual THMs by quartile , we found the greatest association with chlorodibromomethane or the sum of the brominated compounds .	
12782495-9	Incorporating tap water consumption showed a similar pattern of reduced cycle length with increasing TTHM exposure .	24 2 241
12782495-10	These findings suggest that THM exposure may affect ovarian function and should be confirmed in other studies .	
18045657-0	The association of age , smoking , alcohol , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , blood lead ( BPb ) and cadmium ( BCd ) levels , and serum levels of copper ( SCu ) , zinc ( SZn ) and selenium ( SSe ) with atopic status and ventilatory function was examined in the groups of 166 women and 50 men with no occupational exposure to metals or other xenobiotics .	11 12 1 122 11123 111 1112
18045657-1	Markers of atopy included serum total IgE , skin prick test ( SPT ) to common inhalatory allergens , non-specific nasal reactivity ( NNR ) and non-specific bronchial reactivity ( NBR ) .	11 1 11123 111 112 1112
18045657-2	Parameters of ventilatory function included forced vital capacity ( FVC ) and forced expiratory volume in the first second ( FEV(1) ) .	1 11 112
18045657-3	Significantly higher BPb , SZn , IgE and prevalence of positive SPT , and lower SCu and NNR was found in men than in women .	
18045657-4	Fifteen women taking female sex hormones ( HT ) had significantly higher SCu than women without HT .	
18045657-5	Regression models showed significant inverse associations between IgE and SCu ( P=0.021 ) and NNR and SCu ( P=0.044 ) in women .	
18045657-6	When excluding women with HT , the association of SCu and total IgE became of borderline significance ( P=0.051 ) , association between SCu and NNR disappeared , and significant positive association between total IgE and BPb emerged ( P=0.046 ) .	
18045657-7	In men , significant inverse association was found between positive SPT and SSe , and between NBR and SSe .	
18045657-8	A decrease in FVC% and FEV(1)% was associated with an increase in smoking intensity ( P&lt;0.001 ) and a decrease in SZn ( P=0.043 and P=0.053 , respectively ) .	
18045657-9	These results were observed at the levels of the metals comparable to those in general populations worldwide .	
18045657-10	The observed differences between men and women may partly be explained by different levels of relevant toxic and essential metals , and their combination .	
18045657-11	The role of female HT in associations of atopy markers and SCu should be further investigated .	
18165906-0	An investigation of various heavy metals including the arsenic ( As ) poisoning in soils and vegetables in five upazillas under Feni district of Bangladesh was performed by neutron activation technique using the neutron irradiation facilities of TRIGA MARK II research reactor at Bangladesh Atomic Energy Research Establishment ( BAERE ) , Savar , Dhaka .	
18165906-1	A total of 30 samples ( 15 surface soils and 15 foodstuffs ) were studied in five Upazillas namely as , Sonagazi , Dagan Bhuiya , Feni Sadar , Fulgazi and Parsuram of Feni district taking three samples of each kind from each upazilla .	
18165906-2	Samples of each kind together with the standard reference material ( SRM ) were irradiated in the same neutron flux and the gamma-rays of nuclides from the irradiated samples were assessed and screened for As , Br , U , Th , Cr , Sc , Fe , Zn and Co in soils and As , Br , Na , K , Cr , Sc , Fe , Zn and Co in vegetables ( i.e ; eddoe , taro , green papaya , plantain , potato , callaloo , bottle ground and carambola ) .	
18165906-3	The measurement of gamma-rays was carried out by means of a calibrated high resolution HPGe detector .	
18165906-4	The concentration of product nuclides containing in the irradiated samples was determined from the peak count-rates of prominent gamma-lines for the corresponding nuclides .	
18165906-5	Among all contaminants , only As , Zn and Cr for both samples were focused because of their higher values compared with the local as well as the world typical values .	
18165906-6	The present results revealed that the mean levels of As in Parsuram , Feni Sadar and Pulgazi upazillas are higher than the world typical value of 2 mg/kg .	
18165906-7	The mean values of Zn and Cr for all upazillas are higher than the world typical values 32 and 27.9 mg/kg , respectively .	
18165906-8	For the case of vegetables , the mean concentration of As is found only in Eddoe ( 5.33 ppm ) and Taro ( 1.46 ppm ) collected from Sonagazi and Feni Sadar upazilla ; which are higher than the values in Samta ( 0.1 ppm for eddoe and 0.44 ppm for taro ) under Jessore district of Bangladesh .	
18165906-9	The mean concentrations of Zn and Cr in all kinds of vegetables are higher compared with the existing local values as well as the world typical values .	
18165906-10	The mean estimated daily dietary intake of As , Zn and Cr from vegetables are found to be 0.105 , 12.47 and 3.53 mg respectively , which are higher than the recommended values of some countries .	24 2 243
18165906-11	The consumption of toxic metals in vegetables is a risk for public health in the studied area .	
18160343-0	We investigated the effect of lead , cadmium and mercury exposure on pregnancy and fertilization rate outcome among 619 Saudi women ( age 19-50 years ) who sought in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) treatment between 2002 and 2003 .	1 11 112
18160343-1	The concentrations of lead , cadmium and mercury were measured in both blood and follicular fluids .	1 12 125
18160343-2	At levels well below the current US occupational exposure limit guidelines ( 40microg/dL ) and even less than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention level of concern for preventing lead poisoning in children ( 10microg/dL ) , blood lead level was negatively associated with fertilization outcome in both adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models .	11 1 122 12 112
18160343-3	We found that among various demographic , socioeconomic and environmental factors , fish consumption was positively associated with blood lead levels .	24 2 243
18160343-4	These results support the hypothesis that a raised blood lead level affects infertility and intervention to reduce the lead exposure might be needed for women of reproductive age .	
18160343-5	The present results also revealed unexpected finding - the positive relationship between follicular cadmium levels and fertilization outcome , which points to the necessity for further investigation .	
18160343-6	Though adverse effect of mercury on pregnancy outcome or fertilization rate was not evident in this study , mercury5.8microg/L ( EPA safety limit ) was found in the blood and follicular fluid of 18.7% and 8.3% of the women , respectively .	1 11 112
18160343-7	Concerns about its possible adverse effects on the physiology of reproduction or fetal development cannot be ruled out .	
18160343-8	It should be noted that skin-lightening creams and dental amalgam were important contributors to mercury exposure .	24 244 2
18160343-9	Such finding is alarming and priority for further studies are , urgently , needed .	
18065169-0	Targeting persons requiring observation in the Cd-polluted Kakehashi River basin a serial observation study was conducted .	
18065169-1	Namely we followed the serial changes in 50 subjects who ingested household rice for 10 years after replacement of Cd-polluted soil in rice paddies .	245 24 2
18065169-2	The serial changes in urinary substance levels in individuals were determined adjusting for the potential effect of age using a general linear mixed model .	1 12 127
18065169-3	Cd excretions decreased with increasing number of years elapsed , with the partial regression coefficients of the number of years elapsed statistically significant in the women .	
18065169-4	The ratio of the Cd excretion theoretical values at the completion of soil replacement and 10 years later was 0.60 and the reduction rate was calculated as 5.0% per year in women .	245 24 2
18065169-5	However , it was surmised that in practice a decrease to the level of inhabitants of non-polluted districts would not be achievable .	
18065169-6	The indices of renal tubular injury ( beta(2)-microglobulin , retinol binding protein ( RBP ) , total protein , amino-N and glucose ) with the exception of amino-N in men showed increased excretion in both sexes with increasing number of years elapsed with statistically significant differences in RBP and total protein in both sexes and glucose in men .	11 1 11122 11123 111 1112
18065169-7	In this study using a general linear mixed model , which is an appropriate statistical method to perform a follow-up study , Cd concentrations in rice and urine were found to decrease after Cd exposure was reduced , but the degree of renal tubular injury was not found to improve , leading to the conclusion that the renal tubular injury induced by environmental Cd exposure is irreversible .	
18096206-0	OBJECTIVE Personal exposure to airborne benzene is influenced by various outdoor and indoor sources .	
18096206-1	The first aim of this study was to assess the benzene exposure of a sample of urban inhabitants living in an inner-city neighborhood of Florence , Italy , excluding exposure from active smoking .	
18096206-2	The secondary objective was to differentiate the personal exposures according to personal usage patterns of the vehicles .	2 233 23
18096206-3	METHODS A sample of 67 healthy non-smokers was monitored by passive samplers during two 4-weekday campaigns in winter and late spring .	2 233 23
18096206-4	Simultaneously , benzene measurements were also taken for a subset of participants , inside and outside their houses .	
18096206-5	A 4-day time microenvironment activity diary was completed by each subject during each sampling period .	
18096206-6	Other relevant exposure data were collected by a questionnaire before the sampling .	
18096206-7	Additional data on urban ambient air benzene levels were also available from the public air quality network .	
18096206-8	The passive samplers , after automated thermal desorption , were analyzed by GC-FID .	
18096206-9	RESULTS Benzene personal exposure levels averaged 6.9 ( SD=2.1 ) and 2.3 ( SD=0.7 ) microg/m(3) in winter and spring , respectively .	2 233 23
18096206-10	Outdoor and indoor levels showed high correlation in winter and poor in spring .	
18096206-11	In winter the highest benzene personal exposure levels were for people traveling by more public transport , followed by users of only car and by users of only bus respectively .	
18096206-12	CONCLUSIONS The time spent in-transport for work or leisure makes a major contribution to benzene exposure among Florentine non-smoking citizens .	
18096206-13	Indoor pollution and transportation means contribute significantly to individual exposure levels especially in winter season .	
23500830-0	Traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions and degrades ambient air quality , and recent studies have shown excess morbidity and mortality for drivers , commuters and individuals living near major roadways .	
23500830-1	Presently , our understanding of the air pollution impacts from congestion on roads is very limited .	
23500830-2	This study demonstrates an approach to characterize risks of traffic for on- and near-road populations .	2 231 23
23500830-3	Simulation modeling was used to estimate on- and near-road NO2 concentrations and health risks for freeway and arterial scenarios attributable to traffic for different traffic volumes during rush hour periods .	2 231 23
23500830-4	The modeling used emission factors from two different models ( Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model and Motor Vehicle Emissions Factor Model version 6.2 ) , an empirical traffic speed-volume relationship , the California Line Source Dispersion Model , an empirical NO2-NOx relationship , estimated travel time changes during congestion , and concentration-response relationships from the literature , which give emergency doctor visits , hospital admissions and mortality attributed to NO2 exposure .	2 231 23
23500830-5	An incremental analysis , which expresses the change in health risks for small increases in traffic volume , showed non-linear effects .	
23500830-6	For a freeway , " U " shaped trends of incremental risks were predicted for on-road populations , and incremental risks are flat at low traffic volumes for near-road populations .	
23500830-7	For an arterial road , incremental risks increased sharply for both on- and near-road populations as traffic increased .	
23500830-8	These patterns result from changes in emission factors , the NO2-NOx relationship , the travel delay for the on-road population , and the extended duration of rush hour for the near-road population .	
23500830-9	This study suggests that health risks from congestion are potentially significant , and that additional traffic can significantly increase risks , depending on the type of road and other factors .	
23500830-10	Further , evaluations of risk associated with congestion must consider travel time , the duration of rush-hour , congestion-specific emission estimates , and uncertainties .	
12727593-0	Particulate air pollution has been associated with adverse respiratory health effects .	
12727593-1	This study assessed the utility of expired nitric oxide to detect acute airway responses to metal-containing fine particulates .	1 11 1113 111
12727593-2	Using a repeated-measures study design , we investigated the association between the fractional concentration of expired nitric oxide ( F(E)NO ) and exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic mass median diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 micro m ( PM(2.5) ) in boilermakers exposed to residual oil fly ash and metal fumes .	2 23
12727593-3	Subjects were monitored for 5 days during boiler repair overhauls in 1999 ( n = 20 ) or 2000 ( n = 14 ) .	23 2 233
12727593-4	The Wilcoxon median baseline F(E)NO was 10.6 ppb [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 9.1 , 12.7 ] in 1999 and 7.4 ppb ( 95% CI : 6.7 , 8.0 ) in 2000 .	
12727593-5	The Wilcoxon median PM(2.5) 8-hr time-weighted average was 0.56 mg/m(3) ( 95% CI : 0.37 , 0.93 ) in 1999 and 0.86 mg/m(3) ( 95% CI : 0.65 , 1.07 ) in 2000 .	
12727593-6	F(E)NO levels during the work week were significantly lower than baseline F(E)NO in 1999 ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
12727593-7	A significant inverse exposure-response relationship between log-transformed F(E)NO and the previous workday's PM(2.5) concentration was found in 1999 , after adjusting for smoking status , age , and sampling year .	2 23
12727593-8	With each 1 mg/m(3) incremental increase in PM(2.5) exposure , log F(E)NO decreased by 0.24 ( 95% CI : -0.38 , -0.10 ) in 1999 .	
12727593-9	The lack of an exposure-response relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and F(E)NO in 2000 could be attributable to exposure misclassification resulting from the use of respirators .	
12727593-10	In conclusion , occupational exposure to metal-containing fine particulates was associated with significant decreases in F(E)NO in a survey of workers with limited respirator usage .	
18155151-0	Human hair samples from male and female people aged 6-85 years , as well as muscle of crabs ( Callinectes sapidus and Callinectes bocourti ) were collected from different fishing places along the Caribbean coastal shoreline of Colombia and analyzed for total mercury ( T-Hg ) in order to establish the impact of mercury-polluted sediments in Cartagena bay on the ecosystem .	1 123 12
18155151-1	Hair T-Hg in inhabitants varied between 0.1 and 21.8 microg/g , with average and median of 1.52 microg/g and 1.1 microg/g , respectively .	1 123 12
18155151-2	Differences between sampling locations were significant ( P&lt;0.01 ) and median values decreased in the order : CaÃ±o del Oro ( 1.5 microg/g)&lt;Bocachica ( 1.4 microg/g ) ( both located in Cartagena Bay)&lt;CoveÃ±as ( 1.2 microg/g)&lt;Lomarena ( 0.7 microg/g)=Tasajera ( 0.7 microg/g ) .	
18155151-3	A similar trend was observed for T-Hg in muscle of crabs , however , along Cartagena bay , T-Hg distribution in these organisms varied widely , with highest values detected in samples collected in front of the extinct chlor-alkali plant .	
18155151-4	Although the T-Hg median for these people is equal to the threshold risk level recommended by U.S. EPA , this study highlights the fact that contaminated sediments are still driving the distribution of mercury through the food chain , allowing its accumulation in fishermen whose diet includes marine products as sources of protein .	
23505771-0	Exposure to lead has been shown to be harmful to adults ; it is a teratogen , it can damage the peripheral nervous system , and it adversely affects the reproductive system .	
23505771-1	Professional lead-based paint remediation workers are at risk of exposure to lead dust .	24 2 242
23505771-2	The authors ' study was conducted to determine if these remediation workers transfer lead from their work site to their vehicles and then potentially expose their families .	
23505771-3	It was hypothesized that remediation workers transported the lead from the remediation work site to the floorboards of their vehicles due to not following required protective equipment use .	
23505771-4	The laboratory's level of quantitation for lead on the wipe samples , 10 microg/ft2 , was used to indicate lead contamination .	24 2 242
23505771-5	This level was exceeded in 50% of the floorboards sampled .	
23505771-6	These results confirm that many vehicle floorboards used by remediation workers are contaminated with lead dust , potentially resulting in transfer of lead dust .	24 2 242
23505771-7	The ultimate detrimental outcome could be the transfer of lead particles to other family members , causing the poisoning of a child or other at-risk person .	
18073786-0	This article presents an integrated , biologically based , source-to-dose assessment framework for modeling multimedia/multipathway/multiroute exposures to arsenic .	2 21
18073786-1	Case studies demonstrating this framework are presented for three US counties ( Hunderton County , NJ ; Pima County , AZ ; and Franklin County , OH ) , representing substantially different conditions of exposure .	
18073786-2	The approach taken utilizes the Modeling ENvironment for TOtal Risk studies ( MENTOR ) in an implementation that incorporates and extends the approach pioneered by Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation ( SHEDS ) , in conjunction with a number of available databases , including NATA , NHEXAS , CSFII , and CHAD , and extends modeling techniques that have been developed in recent years .	2 21
18073786-3	Model results indicate that , in most cases , the food intake pathway is the dominant contributor to total exposure and dose to arsenic .	
18073786-4	Model predictions are evaluated qualitatively by comparing distributions of predicted total arsenic amounts in urine with those derived using biomarker measurements from the NHEXAS--Region V study : the population distributions of urinary total arsenic levels calculated through MENTOR and from the NHEXAS measurements are in general qualitative agreement .	1 12 127
18073786-5	Observed differences are due to various factors , such as interindividual variation in arsenic metabolism in humans , that are not fully accounted for in the current model implementation but can be incorporated in the future , in the open framework of MENTOR .	
18073786-6	The present study demonstrates that integrated source-to-dose modeling for arsenic can not only provide estimates of the relative contributions of multipathway exposure routes to the total exposure estimates , but can also estimate internal target tissue doses for speciated organic and inorganic arsenic , which can eventually be used to improve evaluation of health risks associated with exposures to arsenic from multiple sources , routes , and pathways .	
23523854-0	Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate ( TDCPP ) is a flame retardant widely used in furniture containing polyurethane foam .	
23523854-1	It is a carcinogen , endocrine disruptor , and potentially neurotoxic .	
23523854-2	Our objectives were to characterize exposure of adult office workers ( n=29 ) to TDCPP by measuring its primary metabolite , bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate ( BDCPP ) , in their urine ; measuring TDCPP in dust from their homes ; offices and vehicles ; and assessing possible predictors of exposure .	24 12 242 1 2 127
23523854-3	We identified TDCPP in 99% of dust ( GM=4.43Î¼g/g ) and BDCPP in 100% of urine samples ( GM=408pg/mL ) .	24 12 127 1 2 242
23523854-4	Concentrations of TDCPP were significantly higher in dust from vehicles ( GM=12.5Î¼g/g ) and offices ( GM=6.06Î¼g/g ) than in dust from the main living area ( GM=4.21Î¼g/g ) or bedrooms ( GM=1.40Î¼g/g ) of worker homes .	
23523854-5	Urinary BDCPP concentrations among participants who worked in a new office building were 26% of those who worked in older buildings ( p=0.01 ) .	1 12 127
23523854-6	We found some evidence of a positive trend between urinary BDCPP and TDCPP in office dust that was not observed in the other microenvironments and may be related to the timing of urine sample collection during the afternoon of a workday .	24 12 242 1 2 127
23523854-7	Overall our findings suggest that exposure to TDCPP in the work environment is one of the contributors to the personal exposure for office workers .	
23523854-8	Further research is needed to confirm specific exposure sources ( e.g. , polyurethane foam ) , determine the importance of exposure in other microenvironments such as homes and vehicles , and address the inhalation and dermal exposure pathways .	
18234288-0	The health implications of the consumption of high arsenic groundwater in Bangladesh and West Bengal are well-documented , however , little is known about the level of arsenic exposure elsewhere in Southeast Asia , where widespread exploitation of groundwater resources is less well established .	
18234288-1	We measured the arsenic concentrations of nail and hair samples collected from residents of Kandal province , Cambodia , an area recently identified to host arsenic-rich groundwaters , in order to evaluate the extent of arsenic exposure .	1 123 12
18234288-2	Nail and hair arsenic concentrations ranged from 0.20 to 6.50 microg g(-1) ( n=70 ) and 0.10 to 7.95 microg g(-1) ( n=40 ) , respectively , in many cases exceeding typical baseline levels .	1 123 12
18234288-3	The arsenic content of the groundwater used for drinking water purposes ( 0.21-943 microg L(-1) ( n=31) ) was positively correlated with both nail ( r=0.74 , p&lt;0.0001 ) and hair ( r=0.86 , p&lt;0.0001 ) arsenic concentrations .	24 2 241
18234288-4	In addition , the nail and hair samples collected from inhabitants using groundwater that exceeded the Cambodian drinking water legal limit of 50 microg L(-1) arsenic contained significantly more arsenic than those of individuals using groundwater containing &lt;50 microg L(-1) arsenic .	24 12 1 123 241 2
18234288-5	X-ray absorption near edge structure ( XANES ) spectroscopy suggested that sulfur-coordinated arsenic was the dominant species in the bulk of the samples analysed , with additional varying degrees of As(III)-O character .	
18234288-6	Tentative linear least squares fitting of the XANES data pointed towards differences in the pattern of arsenic speciation between the nail and hair samples analysed , however , mismatches in sample and standard absorption peak intensity prevented us from unambiguously determining the arsenic species distribution .	1 123 12
18234288-7	The good correlation with the groundwater arsenic concentration , allied with the relative ease of sampling such tissues , indicate that the arsenic content of hair and nail samples may be used as an effective biomarker of arsenic intake in this relatively recently exposed population .	
23532094-0	Regulatory monitoring data and land-use regression ( LUR ) models have been widely used for estimating individual exposure to ambient air pollution in epidemiologic studies .	
23532094-1	However , LUR models lack fine-scale temporal resolution for predicting acute exposure and regulatory monitoring provides daily concentrations , but fails to capture spatial variability within urban areas .	
23532094-2	This study coupled LUR models with continuous regulatory monitoring to predict daily ambient nitrogen dioxide ( NO(2) ) and particulate matter ( PM(2.5) ) at 50 homes in Windsor , Ontario .	2 231 23
23532094-3	We compared predicted versus measured daily outdoor concentrations for 5 days in winter and 5 days in summer at each home .	
23532094-4	We also examined the implications of using modeled versus measured daily pollutant concentrations to predict daily lung function among asthmatic children living in those homes .	11 23 1 2 112 231
23532094-5	Mixed effect analysis suggested that temporally refined LUR models explained a greater proportion of the spatial and temporal variance in daily household-level outdoor NO(2) measurements compared with daily concentrations based on regulatory monitoring .	
23532094-6	Temporally refined LUR models captured 40% ( summer ) and 10% ( winter ) more of the spatial variance compared with regulatory monitoring data .	
23532094-7	Ambient PM(2.5) showed little spatial variation ; therefore , daily PM(2.5) models were similar to regulatory monitoring data in the proportion of variance explained .	
23532094-8	Furthermore , effect estimates for forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV(1) ) and peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) based on modeled pollutant concentrations were consistent with effects based on household-level measurements for NO(2) and PM(2.5) .	11 23 1 2 112 231
23532094-9	These results suggest that LUR modeling can be combined with continuous regulatory monitoring data to predict daily household-level exposure to ambient air pollution .	2 231 23
23532094-10	Temporally refined LUR models provided a modest improvement in estimating daily household-level NO(2) compared with regulatory monitoring data alone , suggesting that this approach could potentially improve exposure estimation for spatially heterogeneous pollutants .	
23532094-11	These findings have important implications for epidemiologic studies - in particular , for research focused on short-term exposure and health effects .	
18059425-0	The relationships between levels of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) in blood and air have not been well characterized in the general population where exposure concentrations are generally at parts per billion levels .	
18059425-1	This study investigates relationships between the levels of nine VOCs , namely , benzene , chloroform , 1,4-dichlorobenzene , ethylbenzene , methyl tert-butyl ether ( MTBE ) , tetrachloroethene , toluene , and m-/p- and o-xylene , in blood and air from a stratified random sample of the general US population .	1 2 122 12 23
18059425-2	We used data collected from 354 participants , including 89 smokers and 265 nonsmokers , aged 20-59 years , who provided samples of blood and air in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 1999-2000 .	1 122 12
18059425-3	Demographic and physiological characteristics were obtained from self-reported information ; smoking status was determined from levels of serum cotinine .	
18059425-4	Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the relationships between VOC levels in air and blood , while adjusting for effects of smoking and demographic factors .	2 23
18059425-5	Although levels of VOCs in blood were positively correlated with the corresponding air levels , the strength of association ( R(2) ) varied from 0.02 ( ethylbenzene ) to 0.68 ( 1,4-DCB ) .	
18059425-6	Also the blood-air relationships of benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , and the xylenes ( BTEX ) were influenced by smoking , exposure-smoking interactions , and by gender , age , and BMI , whereas those of the other VOCs were not .	1 2 122 12 23
18059425-7	Interestingly , the particular exposure-smoking interaction for benzene was different from those for toluene , ethylbenzene , and the xylenes .	
18059425-8	Whereas smokers retained more benzene in their blood at increasing exposure levels , they retained less toluene , ethylbenzene , and xylenes at increasing exposure levels .	
18059425-9	Investigators should consider interaction effects of exposure levels and smoking when exploring the blood-air relationships of the BTEX compounds in the general population .	
12625229-0	The determination of cumulative exposures for individual workers is necessary for research and practice of occupational health and hygiene .	
12625229-1	Reconstruction of exposures for a study of respiratory morbidity was needed to study the effects of exposure to carbon black production .	
12625229-2	Approximately 15,800 exposure estimates were needed .	
12625229-3	There were 22 plants , a 40-year time span , six job categories , and three types of dust-exposure metrics ( respirable , inhalable , and " total " dust ) .	2 232 23
12625229-4	Three information sources were used : 1 ) Industrial hygiene air level measurements where available ( several industry-wide surveys had been conducted ) .	2 232 23
12625229-5	2 ) A formal process survey identifying specific dates and types of process and control changes .	
12625229-6	3 ) An Historical Relative Exposure Rating Scale ; plant health and safety personnel used this spreadsheet-based rating scheme to quantify exposures before and between years of actual measurement relative to a reference year in which measurements were available .	
12625229-7	A job-exposure matrix was calculated by integrating these three methods .	2 21
12625229-8	Linear scaling factors were identified to interconvert geometric to arithmetic means and to interconvert total and inhalable dust .	
12625229-9	Individual worker cumulative exposures were then calculated based upon job histories linked with the job-exposure matrix .	
12625229-10	The nine-step process for integrating all available relevant data was effective in estimating the exposures for each of the cells of the job-exposure matrix .	
12625229-11	Among the 1680 workers participating , the mean cumulative inhalable dust exposure was 48.4 mg-years/m3 .	2 232 23
12625229-12	Early years contribute disproportionately to the cumulative exposures of individuals since levels have declined significantly over time .	
12625229-13	The use of multiple sources of information , including a relative exposure rating instrument , significantly facilitates reconstruction of historical exposures .	
12625229-14	Inadequate adjustment for temporal trends can lead to underestimation of cumulative exposures and significantly affect estimation of dose-effect relationships .	
12625229-15	These methods are applicable to other situations requiring estimation of cumulative exposure with sparse industrial hygiene data in early years .	
18351114-0	The validity of traffic intensity near the home as an estimate for the personal long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution in an adult population was tested .	
18351114-1	Personal and near-home outdoor exposure to PM2.5 , soot , NO , NO2 , and NOx was monitored four to five times during 48 h periods in older adults .	2 233 23
18351114-2	A group of 23 participants lived in high traffic intensity streets ( &gt;10000 vehicles/(24 h) ) , and 22 lived in low traffic intensity streets .	
18351114-3	The relation between average personal exposure and traffic intensity at the residential address was explored by taking indoor sources into account .	2 233 23
18351114-4	Large differences in the measured outdoor concentrations between locations in high traffic and low traffic intensity streets were found for soot ( 68% ) , NO ( 127% ) , and NOx ( 35% ) .	
18351114-5	Differences were smaller for PM2.5 ( 14% ) and NO2 ( 22% ) .	
18351114-6	Slightly elevated ratios were found for personal exposure to soot ( 1.15 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.01-1.30)when comparing adults living in high traffic intensity streets with adults living in low traffic intensity streets .	
18351114-7	For NO , increased personal exposure ( 1.16 ) was seen for the same comparison , but this difference failed to reach statistical significance ( CI , 0.80-1.66 ) .	
18351114-8	Traffic intensity on the street of residence predicted personal exposure to soot but not to PM2.5 or nitrogen oxides .	
18351114-9	Traffic intensity may not correlate well to personal exposure and accordingly substantial misclassification of exposure may occur when traffic intensity is used as an exposure indicator in epidemiological studies .	
18351114-10	Time spent in traffic and spending time outdoors were associated with increased personal exposure of soot and PM2.5 , but not NOx .	
23587105-0	BACKGROUND The aim was to investigate possible associations between glioma ( an aggressive type of brain cancer ) and occupational exposure to selected agents : combustion products ( diesel and gasoline exhaust emissions , benzo(a)pyrene ) , dusts ( animal dust , asbestos , crystalline silica , wood dust ) and some other chemical agents ( formaldehyde , oil mist , sulphur dioxide ) .	24 2 242 23
23587105-1	METHODS The INTEROCC study included cases diagnosed with glioma during 2000-2004 in sub-regions of seven countries .	
23587105-2	Population controls , selected from various sampling frames in different centers , were frequency or individually matched to cases by sex , age and center .	
23587105-3	Face-to-face interviews with the subject or a proxy respondent were conducted by trained interviewers .	
23587105-4	Detailed information was collected on socio-economic and lifestyle characteristics , medical history and work history .	
23587105-5	Occupational exposure to the 10 selected agents was assessed by a job exposure matrix ( JEM ) which provides estimates of the probability and level of exposure for different occupations .	2 21
23587105-6	Using a 25% probability of exposure in a given occupation in the JEM as the threshold for considering a worker exposed , the lifetime prevalence of exposure varied from about 1% to about 15% for the different agents .	
23587105-7	Associations between glioma and each of the 10 agents were estimated by conditional logistic regression , and using three separate exposure indices : i ) ever vs. never ; ii ) lifetime cumulative exposure ; iii ) total duration of exposure .	
23587105-8	RESULTS The study sample consisted of 1,800 glioma cases and 5,160 controls .	
23587105-9	Most odds ratio estimates were close to the null value .	
23587105-10	None of the ten agents displayed a significantly increased odds ratio nor any indication of dose-response relationships with cumulative exposure or with duration of exposure .	
23587105-11	CONCLUSION Thus , there was no evidence that these exposures influence risk of glioma .	
12573907-0	We reported previously that increases in ambient air pollution in the Los Angeles basin increased the risk of low weight and premature birth .	
12573907-1	However , ambient concentrations measured at monitoring stations may not take into account differential exposure to pollutants found in elevated concentrations near heavy-traffic roadways .	
12573907-2	Therefore , we used an epidemiologic case-control study design to examine whether residential proximity to heavy-traffic roadways influenced the occurrence of low birth weight ( LBW ) and/or preterm birth in Los Angeles County between 1994 and 1996 .	1 11 112
12573907-3	We mapped subject home locations at birth and estimated exposure to traffic-related air pollution using a distance-weighted traffic density ( DWTD ) measure .	2 231 23
12573907-4	This measure takes into account residential proximity to and level of traffic on roadways surrounding homes .	
12573907-5	We calculated odds ratios ( ORs ) and risk ratios ( RRs ) for being LBW and/or preterm per quintile of DWTD .	
12573907-6	The clearest exposure-response pattern was observed for preterm birth , with an RR of 1.08 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.01-1.15 ] for infants in the highest DWTD quintile .	
12573907-7	Although higher risks were observed for LBW infants , exposure-response relations were less consistent .	
12573907-8	Examining the influence of season , we found elevated risks primarily for women whose third trimester fell during fall/winter months ( OR(term LBW ) = 1.39 ; 95% CI , 1.16-1.67 ; OR(preterm and LBW ) = 1.24 ; 95% CI = 1.03-1.48 ; RR(all preterm ) = 1.15 ; 95% CI , 1.05-1.26 ) , and exposure-response relations were stronger for all outcomes .	
12573907-9	This result is consistent with elevated pollution in proximity to sources during more stagnant air conditions present in winter months .	
12573907-10	Our previous research and these latest results suggest exposure to traffic-related pollutants may be important .	
23593421-0	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE High concentrations of air pollutants have been linked to increased incidence of stroke in North America and Europe but not yet assessed in mainland China .	
23593421-1	The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between stroke hospitalization and short-term elevation of air pollutants in Wuhan , China .	2 231 23
23593421-2	METHODS Daily mean NO2 , SO2 and PM10 levels , temperature and humidity were obtained from 2006 through 2008 .	2 231 23
23593421-3	Data on stroke hospitalizations ( ICD 10 : I60-I69 ) at four hospitals in Wuhan were obtained for the same period .	
23593421-4	A time-stratified case-crossover design was performed by season ( April-September and October-March ) to assess effects of pollutants on stroke hospital admissions .	2 231 23
23593421-5	RESULTS Pollution levels were higher in October-March with averages of 136.1 Âµg/m(3) for PM10 , 63.6 Âµg/m(3) for NO2 and 71.0 Âµg/m(3) for SO2 than in April-September when averages were 102.0 Âµg/m(3) , 41.7 Âµg/m(3) and 41.7 Âµg/m(3) , respectively ( p&lt;.001 ) .	
23593421-6	During the cold season , every 10 Âµg/m(3) increase in NO2 was associated with a 2.9% ( 95%C.I. 1.2%-4.6% ) increase in stroke admissions on the same day .	
23593421-7	Every 10 ug/m(3) increase in PM10 daily concentration was significantly associated with an approximate 1% ( 95% C.I. 0.1%-1.4% ) increase in stroke hospitalization .	
23593421-8	A two-pollutant model indicated that NO2 was associated with stroke admissions when controlling for PM10 .	2 231 23
23593421-9	During the warm season , no significant associations were noted for any of the pollutants .	
23593421-10	CONCLUSIONS Exposure to NO2 is significantly associated with stroke hospitalizations during the cold season in Wuhan , China when pollution levels are 50% greater than in the warm season .	
23593421-11	Larger and multi-center studies in Chinese cities are warranted to validate our findings .	
18037156-0	Concentrations of tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA ) and alpha- , beta- , and gamma-isomers of hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-ESI-MS/MS ) in human adipose tissue obtained in New York City , and in three marine top-level predators--bottlenose dolphin , bull shark , and Atlantic sharpnose shark--collected from coastal waters of Florida , USA .	1 121 12
18037156-1	The overall mean concentrations ( mean+/-SD ) of TBBPA and HBCDs were 0.048+/-0.102 and 0.333+/-0.571 ng/g lipid wt in human adipose tissue samples , 1.2+/-3 and 7.38+/-18 ng/g lipid wt in bottlenose dolphin blubber , 9.5+/-12 and 77.7+/-128 ng/g lipid wt in bull shark muscle , and 0.872+/-0.5 and 54.5+/-88 ng/g lipid wt in Atlantic sharpnose shark muscle .	1 121 12
18037156-2	Overall mean concentrations of HBCDs were 5-10-fold higher than mean TBBPA concentrations , in all of the samples analyzed .	
18037156-3	The highest concentrations of TBBPA and HBCDs were detected in the bull shark muscle at concentrations of 35.6 and 413 ng/g , lipid wt , respectively .	
18037156-4	Concentrations of TBBPA and HBCDs , after log-transformation , were significantly correlated with each other in human adipose tissue and bottlenose dolphin blubber , but not in bull shark muscle samples .	
18037156-5	In the human adipose tissue samples , the concentrations of HBCDs were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) previously reported for the same set of tissue samples .	
18037156-6	Concentrations of HBCDs in human samples from the United States were 1-5-fold lower than the concentrations reported from several European countries .	
18037156-7	HBCD concentrations in bottlenose dolphins from the United States were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations reported for other cetacean species from Europe .	
18037156-8	The present report is the first to determine levels of TBBPA and HBCDs in humans , bottlenose dolphins , and sharks from the United States .	
23602974-0	The modified BCR ( the European Community Bureau of Reference ) sequential extraction procedure was applied for partitioning and evaluating the mobility , availability and persistence of trace metals ( Al , Cd , Co , Cr , Cu , Ni , Pb , Sr , V and Zn ) in urban street dusts collected from different areas of Nanjing , China .	
23602974-1	The mobility sequence based on the sum of the BCR sequential extraction stages was : Sr ( 91.65%)&gt;Pb ( 79.16%)&gt;Zn ( 74.26%)&gt;Cu ( 68.53%)&gt;Co ( 45.98%)&gt;Al ( 40.01%)âV ( 38.45%)âNi ( 37.88%)&gt;Cr ( 29.35%)&gt;Cd ( 22.68% ) .	
23602974-2	Almost every trace metal had its highest total concentrations in the industrial area , except for Sr which had its highest concentration in the commercial area .	
23602974-3	Contamination factors ( Cf ) , risk assessment code ( RAC ) and enrichment factor ( Ef ) were then calculated to further assess the environmental risk and provide a preliminary estimate of the main sources of trace metals in street dusts .	
23602974-4	Non-carcinogenic effects and carcinogenic effects due to exposure to urban street dusts were assessed for both children and adults .	24 2 242
23602974-5	For non-carcinogenic effects , ingestion was the main route of exposure to street dusts for these metals , followed by dermal contact and inhalation .	24 242 2 22 23
23602974-6	Hazard index values for all studied metals were lower than the safe level of 1 , and Pb exhibited the highest risk value ( 0.125 ) in the case of children .	
23602974-7	The carcinogenic risk for Cd , Co , Cr and Ni were all below the acceptable level ( &lt;10(-6) ) .	
17996230-0	Despite many claims of broad benefits , especially for in utero development , derived from the consumption of fish as a source of omega-3 fatty acids , individual species of fish and shellfish provide substantially varied levels of these fatty acids .	
17996230-1	Likewise , mean methylmercury ( MeHg ) concentrations for fish and shellfish species differ by greater than an order of magnitude .	
17996230-2	Consideration of within-species variability would increase this variation farther .	
17996230-3	Exposures to both MeHg and to the omega-3 fatty acids reflect dietary choices including species consumed , frequency of consumption , and portion size .	
17996230-4	In view of these sources of variability , data on dietary patterns and blood mercury ( microg/L ) among women of child-bearing age ( e.g. , 16-49 years ) provided an indication of exposures in the United States .	24 12 1 122 2 243
17996230-5	Utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) for survey years 1999--2002 , calculated consumption of MeHg and omega-3 fatty acids from fish and shellfish have been estimated based on results from 3614 women who provided 30-day dietary recall and 24-hours records .	24 2 243
17996230-6	Statistics from NHANES when appropriately weighted are representative of the US population .	
17996230-7	The association between dietary MeHg from fish and shellfish and dietary fish intake yielded a Pearson correlation of 0.68 .	24 2 243
17996230-8	The Pearson correlation between estimated 30-day intake from fish/shellfish consumption for omega-3 fatty acids and MeHg was 0.66 .	24 2 243
17996230-9	Evaluation of the most commonly consumed fish and shellfish species as sources of MeHg and omega-3 fatty acids indicated that salmon followed by shrimp are principal sources of omega-3 fatty acids and are lesser sources of MeHg , in contrast with tuna which provides omega-3 fatty acids , but considerably higher levels of MeHg .	
17996230-10	These data can be used to guide selection of individual fish and shellfish species that are higher in omega-3 content and low in MeHg concentrations .	
17996230-11	This more refined dietary approach contrasts with generic recommendations that simply advise increasing fish consumption as a path toward improving cardiovascular health and providing benefits for in utero development or avoiding fish altogether .	
12568764-0	Trail , British Columbia has been the site of an active lead-zinc smelter for approximately 95 years .	
12568764-1	Since 1989 , the community has been monitoring blood lead levels in children , studying exposure pathways and conducting comprehensive education and case management programs .	
12568764-2	From 1989 through 1996 , mean blood lead levels of pre-school children declined at an average rate of 0.6 microg/dl per year .	24 245 12 1 122 2 242
12568764-3	From 1996 to 1999 , mean blood lead levels fell at an average rate of 1.8 microg/dl per year , from 11.5 in 1996 to 5.9 in 1999 .	
12568764-4	The recent rapid decline appears to be mainly attributable to the start-up of a new lead smelter using modern flash-smelting technology in May of 1997 .	
12568764-5	In 1998 , the annual arithmetic mean air lead level in Trail was 0.28 microg/m(3) , compared with 1.1 microg/m(3) in 1996 .	2 23
12568764-6	Reductions of approximately 50% were observed in lead loadings and concentrations in outdoor dustfall , street dust and indoor dustfall after smelter emissions were reduced .	
12568764-7	Slight reductions ( statistically insignificant ) have been observed in carpet dust and soil lead concentrations .	245 24 2 242
12568764-8	During the summer of 2001 , the smelting and refining operations at Trail were shut down completely for 3 months .	
12568764-9	During this period , average air lead levels in Trail dropped to 0.03 microg/m(3) .	2 23
12568764-10	The average blood lead level in Trail pre-school children at the end of the shutdown was 4.7 microg/dl .	1 122 12
12568764-11	These results challenge prevailing theories about the relative importance of various environmental lead sources .	
12568764-12	For example , the US EPA Integrated Biokinetic Uptake Model for Lead ( IEUBK ) , with its emphasis on soil concentrations , would not have predicted the dramatic decline in children's blood lead levels seen in Trail following the reductions in air lead levels .	24 245 12 1 122 2
12568764-13	The Trail experience suggests that increased attention should be paid to the importance of active sources of highly bioavailable and mobile lead bearing dusts .	
17980403-0	The use of iridium in the latest catalytic converters to further reduce nitrogen oxide emission in the exhaust of lean-burn engines could result in increased atmospheric levels of this element in high-density vehicle traffic areas .	
17980403-1	The objective of this study is to assess environmental Ir pollution and its urinary levels in workers and an urban control group .	1 12 127
17980403-2	Environmental monitoring inside a tram consisted in air samplings of total suspended particles ( TSP ) , PM10 and PM2.5 carried out during November 2005 .	2 232 23
17980403-3	Urinary Ir levels were evaluated in 64 municipal tram drivers and in 58 administrative employees as controls .	1 12 127
17980403-4	Quantification of Ir in air samples and urine was performed by means of Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry .	1 2 127 12 23
17980403-5	Means+/-standard deviation of Ir levels in TSP , in PM10 and PM2.5 fractions were 1.43+/-1.66 , 0.44+/-0.27 and 0.36+/-0.19 pg m(-3) , respectively .	
17980403-6	No statistically significant differences were observed among urinary Ir values in the exposed subjects and control group .	
17980403-7	The Ir levels in Rome air are still sufficiently low , even if the increased use of new Ir-based catalysts could be of some concern in the near future .	
17980403-8	The results of our study are of interest as they are a first attempt to explore airborne levels and urinary concentrations of Ir in an urban context at medium-high density of vehicle traffic .	1 12 127
17980403-9	Particular attention should be given to the fact that Ir was found in the finest dust particles as the effects of fine particles containing Ir have not yet been studied .	
23618881-0	OBJECTIVE In this retrospective cohort ( 1998 to 2007 ) , 145,445 singleton live births in Hillsborough , Florida , were analyzed to elucidate the relationship between fetal morbidity and prenatal exposure to six criteria air pollutants .	2 231 23
23618881-1	METHODS This study was based on three linked databases : Florida Hospital Discharge , vital statistics records , and air pollution meteorological data from the Environmental Protection Agency .	2 231 23
23618881-2	The primary outcomes of interest were low birth weight , preterm births , and small for gestational age .	1 11 112
23618881-3	This study used structural equation modeling and trimester groupings to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and birth outcomes of pregnant residents .	11 1 2 112 23
23618881-4	RESULTS The latent variables of structural equation modeling yielded a significant B value of 0.35 , indicating that exposure to the criteria pollutants in pregnancy may have a significant relationship to fetal morbidity .	
23618881-5	CONCLUSION Exposure to criteria air pollutants in pregnancy is associated with fetal morbidity outcomes .	2 231 23
17961541-0	UNLABELLED Children may be at particular risk from toxic effects of mercury ( Hg ) .	
17961541-1	Previous studies of hair ( organic ) and urine ( inorganic ) Hg levels in US children were unable to assess Hg levels while accounting for exposure to amalgam dental restorations .	
17961541-2	This analysis describes , over a 5-year period , levels and correlates/predictors of scalp hair ( H-Hg ) and urinary ( U-Hg ) mercury in 534 New England Children's Amalgam Trial ( NECAT ) participants , aged 6-10 years and without exposure to dental amalgam at baseline .	24 12 1 244 123 127 2
17961541-3	RESULTS Mean H-Hg levels were between 0.3 and 0.4 microg/g over 5 years. 17-29% of children had H-Hg levels &gt ; or = 0.5 microg/g , and 5.0 to 8.5% of children had levels &gt ; or = 1 microg/g , in any given study year .	24 12 1 244 123 243 127 2
17961541-4	In adjusted models , fish consumption frequency was the most robust predictor of high H-Hg .	24 2 243
17961541-5	U-Hg mean levels were between 0.7 and 0.9 microg/g creatinine over two years .	
17961541-6	The percentage of those with U-Hg &gt ; or 2.3 microg/g creatinine ranged from 4% to 6% .	
17961541-7	Number of amalgam restorations had a significant dose-response relationship with U-Hg level .	24 244 2
17961541-8	Daily gum chewing in the presence of amalgam was associated with high U-Hg .	24 2 243
18439655-0	This study was conducted to explore the exposure potential of Chinese residents to PBBs , PBDEs , and PCBs in e-waste disassembly sites in Zhejiang province .	
18439655-1	The contents of 23 PBB congeners , 12 PBDE congeners , and 27 PCB congeners in hair and in their potential sources , including soil and e-waste , were measured via GC-MS .	24 245 12 1 123 2
18439655-2	The levels of PHAHs in the three subfamilies ( i.e. , the PBBs , PBDEs , and PCBs ) were all considerably higher ( P&lt;0.05 ) in hair samples collected from the disassembly sites than from the control site .	1 123 12
18439655-3	The highest levels of PBBs ( 57.77 ng g(-1) dw ) , PBDEs ( 29.64 ng g(-1) dw ) , and PCBs ( 181.99 ng g(-1) dw ) in hair were all found in those from the disassembly site Xinqiu , which are respectively 2 , 2 , and 10 times more than those observed in hair from the control site Yandang .	
18439655-4	Among the three subfamilies of PHAHs , PCBs were the most predominant pollutants detected .	
18439655-5	PBBs , which have very limited information available in China , can be detected at a comparable level with PBDEs in these samples in the study .	
18439655-6	Therefore , these observations suggested that more attention should be given over the potential for environmental or occupational exposure to PHAHs present in e-waste .	
18439655-7	By and large , the PHAH levels measured in the hair samples were consistent with those detected in the soil .	24 245 12 1 123 2
18439655-8	Hair analysis could thus be a valid screening tool for assessing human PHAHs exposure in and around e-waste disassembly sites .	1 123 12
12515677-0	In this paper , we present national maps of relative rates of mortality associated with short-term exposure to particulate matter &lt ; 10 micro m in aerodynamic diameter ( PM(10) ) .	2 231 23
12515677-1	We report results for 88 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States from 1987 to 1994 for all-cause mortality , combined cardiovascular and respiratory deaths , and other causes of mortality .	
12515677-2	Maximum likelihood estimates of the relative rate of mortality associated with PM(10)and the degree of statistical uncertainty were obtained for each of the 88 cities by fitting a separate log-linear regression of the daily mortality rate on air pollution level and potential confounders .	2 23
12515677-3	We obtained Bayesian estimates of the relative rates by fitting a hierarchical model that takes into account spatial correlation among the true city-specific relative rates .	
12515677-4	We found that daily variations of PM(10) are positively associated with daily variations of mortality .	2 231 23
12515677-5	In particular , the relative rate estimates of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality associated with PM(10) are larger on average than the relative rate estimates of all-cause and other-cause mortality .	
12515677-6	The estimated increase in the relative rate of death from cardiovascular and respiratory mortality , all-cause mortality , and other-cause mortality were 0.31% ( 95% posterior interval , 0.15-0.5 ) , 0.22% ( 95% posterior interval , 0.1-0.38 ) , and 0.13% ( 95% posterior interval , -0.05 to 0.29 ) , respectively .	
12515677-7	Bayesian estimates of the city-specific relative rates ranged from 0.23% to 0.35% for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality , from 0.18% to 0.27% for all causes , and from 0.10% to 0.20% for other causes of mortality .	
12515677-8	The spatial characterization of effects across cities offers the potential to identify factors that could influence the effect of PM(10) on health , including particle characteristics , offering insights into mechanisms by which PM(10) causes adverse health effects .	
23651776-0	p,p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) is the main metabolite of pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and a marker of past exposure to this organochlorine pesticide. p,p'-DDE is considered a persistent organic pollutant with potential adverse effects on human health .	1 12
23651776-1	The aims of the present study were to assess p,p'-DDE levels in serum and adipose tissue from a cohort of adults in southern Spain and to explore the predictors of exposure from a gender perspective .	1 121 122 12
23651776-2	Chemical analyses were performed using gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry in tandem mode .	
23651776-3	The study population ( n=387 ) was intraoperatively recruited in two areas of Granada Province ( southern Spain ) , and data on potential predictors of these concentrations were gathered by questionnaire .	
23651776-4	The statistical analysis was performed by means of multivariable linear regression models .	
23651776-5	All participants showed detectable concentrations of p,p'-DDE in both serum and adipose tissue , with median concentrations of 175.7 and 93.0 ng/g lipid , respectively ( p&lt;0.001 ) , and the two measurements showed positive correlations .	1 121 122 12
23651776-6	Women showed higher concentrations than men ( 115.8 and 66.2 ng/g lipid , respectively , p&lt;0.001 ) .	
23651776-7	Concentrations in both matrices were positively associated with fatty food consumption , as well as with age and BMI , the latter only in adipose tissue .	24 2 243
23651776-8	The multivariate model showed that , among women , adipose tissue concentrations were approximately 40% higher in those residing in the semi-rural area and 2-fold higher in those whose mothers had participated in agricultural activities during the pregnancy .	1 121 12
23651776-9	In this study population , gender and place of residence play a key role in human exposure to p,p'-DDE and can be used to identify subjects at special risk of long-term exposure .	
18502474-0	BACKGROUND Mercury is a global pollutant that affects neurodevelopment of children .	
18502474-1	OBJECTIVE The objectives were to measure and evaluate mercury concentration of children and mothers , and its association with exposure .	
18502474-2	METHODS A cross-sectional assessment was done using questionnaires and hair mercury were analysed by Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrometry in the National Institute for Minamata Disease in Japan .	1 123 12
18502474-3	RESULTS A total of 112 children and 111 mothers were included ; mean age was 34 months and 32 years , respectively. 17.9% of children and 34.2% of mothers had concentrations greater than 1 parts per million ( ppm ) as reference level .	
18502474-4	Body weight at birth , feeding methods , maternal age , and maternal education level were significantly different in each group ( p&lt;.05 ) .	
18502474-5	Mean maternal hair mercury level ( 0.91 ppm ) was higher than children ( 0.74 ppm ) , and has a positive correlation between them ( p&lt;.05). 68.1% of children , 75% of pregnant period , 63.4% of lactating period , and 78.6% of last six months have been consuming fish .	24 2 243
18502474-6	With multiple regression analysis , hair mercury levels in children aged less than 6 months had a linear relationship with body weight at birth , gestational weeks , feeding methods ( breast- or bottle- feeding ) and maternal educational level .	24 12 1 123 243 2
18502474-7	While children aged over 6 months significantly differed with gender , frequency of fish servings per week , and frequency of maternal fish consumption in lactation period .	24 2 243
18502474-8	And hair mercury levels had inverse linear relationship with maternal monthly income in this age group .	
18502474-9	Maternal mercury levels had linear relationship with maternal age .	
18502474-10	CONCLUSION Mercury levels in children may be affected by their mothers due to similar dietary patterns .	
18502474-11	Further long-term large-scale and follow-up studies are needed .	
17904222-0	Mercury levels in hair of a general population , 237 adults aged between 35-45 , in Naples , Italy , were assessed .	1 123 12
17904222-1	The subjects were asked to fill in a questionnaire about age , gender , body weight , height , body mass index ( BMI ) , fish consumption , number , surface and area of dental amalgam fillings .	24 244 2 243
17904222-2	Total mercury ( THg ) concentrations in human hair ranged from 0.221 to 3.402 microg/g and the mean value for the subjects under study was 0.638 microg/g .	1 123 12
17904222-3	Study participants were divided into three groups in accordance with fish consumption and dental amalgam : ANF ( amalgam and no fish ) ; NAF ( no amalgam but with fish ) and AAF ( amalgam and fish ) .	24 244 2 243
17904222-4	Significant differences in THg were found in the three groups ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
17904222-5	A multiple linear regression analysis showed a weak but significant correlation of THg content in hair with respect to gender and age , but almost no association was found between THg and dental fillings .	1 123 12
17904222-6	Conversely , a strong correlation was obtained between THg and fish consumption regardless of the group evaluated .	
17904222-7	Finally , mercury levels in hair exceeded the levels corresponding to the EPA reference dose ( RfD ) of 0.1 microg Hg/kg body weight per day ( 1 microg Hg/g hair ) in 6% of the population ( 4% men and 2% women ) .	
17904222-8	However , the THg limits in our subjects were not exceeded according to the WHO guidelines , which use a benchmark dose of 0.23 microg Hg/kg bw/day ( 14 microg Hg/g maternal hair ) .	
9926426-0	Seasonal differences in the particle size fractions and mass loadings of household dust deposited on indoor surfaces were examined in four New Jersey homes .	24 2 242
9926426-1	Housedust was collected during a 30-day period on non-electrostatic polyethylene sample plates on which a glass slide had been placed .	24 2 242
9926426-2	In each home two samples were collected at a height of 1.5 m and two were collected at a height of 0.3 m above the floor .	
9926426-3	Dust samples were obtained from each home during a summer and winter collection period .	24 2 242
9926426-4	Particle size measurement was completed using an adaptation of a Meridian ACAS 570 Interactive Laser Cytometer .	
9926426-5	Results indicated that the dust mass deposited on household surfaces during the summer was greater than during the winter .	
9926426-6	The arithmetic mean mass deposition rate for all houses was 0.37 +/- 0.13 microgram/cm2/day during the summer and 0.22 +/- 0.13 microgram/cm2/day during the winter .	
9926426-7	The total number of particles deposited , however , was greater during the winter than during the summer .	
9926426-8	The increase in winter time particle number was caused by greater numbers of particles with an equivalent spherical diameter &lt ; 2.5 microns .	
9926426-9	The most probable source of these particles was winter time combustion emissions within the residences and the subsequent particle deposition on household surfaces .	
9926426-10	The greater mass loadings measured on the low sampling plates during the summer were associated with a greater number of particles with an equivalent spherical diameter &gt ; 5 microns .	
9926426-11	In the winter , however , the particle mass and number loadings were similar at both heights .	
9926426-12	These results suggested that ventilation of the house during the summer allowed resuspended particles to enter which led to the higher levels of settled dust .	24 2 242
9926426-13	Measurement of contaminant levels in housedust for exposure estimation therefore , should account for the seasonal and height differences in dust mass , and collect representative fractions of housedust that are available for human contact .	24 2 242
9926426-14	Furthermore , since over 99% of the particles on indoor surfaces were &lt ; 50 microns any indirect sampling technique for dermal exposure estimation should have collection efficiencies similar to the hand of particles &lt ; 50 microns .	
18522114-0	Estimates of exposure to the flame-retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in dust dust are very poor due to limited knowledge about dust dust ingestion .	
18522114-1	This study was undertaken to determine if PBDEs could be measured on hand hand wipes , and if so , to determine the distribution of levels present on the skin surface area to provide preliminary exposure estimates from hand-to-mouth contact .	
18522114-2	Hand Hand wipes were collected from 33 individuals residing in the United States using sterile gauze pads soaked in isopropyl alcohol .	24 2 242
18522114-3	The total PBDE residue collected on the wipes ranged from 2.60 to 1982 ng , with a median value of 130 ng , or normalized to hand hand surface area , a concentration of 135 pg/cm2 .	
18522114-4	The fully brominated congener , BDE 209 , was also detected and ranged from &lt ; DL to 270 ng with a median value of 26 ng .	
18522114-5	Congener patterns observed on the wipes were similar to patterns observed in house dust dust samples , consisting of congeners associated with the PentaBDE and DecaBDE mixtures , suggesting that the source of PBDEs to the hands may be dust dust particles .	
18522114-6	However , PBDE hand hand residues may also be a result of direct contact with PBDE-laden products , leading to adsorption to the skin surface oils .	
18522114-7	Repeated wipe sampling from three individuals suggests that sigmaPBDE levels on the hand hand may be relatively consistent for some individuals but not for others .	24 2 242
18522114-8	Furthermore , levels of sigmaPBDEs were greater on the bottom of the hands relative to the top of the hands .	
18522114-9	Using these values we have calculated potential human exposure from hand-to-mouth contact .	24 2
18522114-10	The median exposure estimates for children and adults are 1380 and 154 ng/day , respectively , whereas the 95th percentile exposure estimates were 6090 and 677 ng/day , respectively .	24 2 242
18522114-11	These estimates are greater than dietary intake rates and suggest hand-to-mouth contact may be a key exposure route for PBDEs .	
9860917-0	Structural equation modeling is a statistical method for partitioning the variance in a set of interrelated multivariate outcomes into that which is due to direct , indirect , and covariate ( exogenous ) effects .	
9860917-1	Despite this model's flexibility to handle different experimental designs , postulation of a causal chain among the endogenous variables and the points of influence of the covariates is required .	
9860917-2	This has motivated the researchers at the University of Cincinnati Department of Environmental Health to be guided by a theoretical model for movement of lead from distal sources ( exterior soil or dust and paint lead ) to proximal sources ( interior dust lead ) and then finally to biologic outcomes ( handwipe and blood lead ) .	
9860917-3	The question of whether a single structural equation model built from proximity arguments can be applied to diverse populations observed in different communities with varying lead amounts , sources , and bioavailabilities is addressed in this article .	
9860917-4	This reanalysis involved data from 1855 children less than 72 months of age enrolled in 11 studies performed over approximately 15 years .	
9860917-5	Data from children residing near former ore-processing sites were included in this reanalysis .	24 245 12 1 122 2 242
9860917-6	A single model adequately fit the data from these 11 studies ; however , the model needs to be flexible to include pathways that are not frequently observed .	
9860917-7	As expected , the more proximal sources of interior dust lead and handwipe lead were the most important predictors of blood lead ; soil lead often had a number of indirect influences .	24 245 12 1 122 2 242
9860917-8	A limited number of covariates were also isolated as usually affecting the endogenous lead variables .	
9860917-9	The blood lead levels surveyed at the ore-processing sites were comparable to and actually somewhat lower than those reported in the the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .	
9860917-10	Lessened bioavailability of the lead at certain of these sites is a probable reason for this finding .	
18522129-0	As part of a large European Union ( EU)-funded comparative toxicology and human epidemiology study , EU-Compare , a selection of organohalogen compounds ( OHCs ) was analyzed in maternal serum , collected at the 35th week of pregnancy , and in cord serum of a number of their infants to determine maternal concentrations and to investigate the extent of transplacental transfer of these compounds .	1 122 12
18522129-1	Eight neutral OHCs were analyzed : one polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB : CB-153),4,4'-DDE , five polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs : BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , and BDE-154 ) , and hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCDD ) .	
18522129-2	Five phenolic OHCs were analyzed : three hydroxylated PCBs ( 40H-CB-107 , 40H-CB-146 , and 40H-CB-187 ) , one hydroxylated PBDE ( 60H-BDE-47 ) , and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) .	
18522129-3	All OHCs , except 60H-BDE-47 , were present in maternal and cord serum .	
18522129-4	The historically identified OHCs showed the highest concentration : 4,4'-DDE ( median value 89 ng/g lipid in maternal serum and 68 ng/g lipid in cord serum ) and PCP ( median value 970 pg/g serum in maternal serum and 1500 pg/g serum in cord serum ) .	1 122 12
18522129-5	HBCDD and the PBDEs were present at much lower concentrations .	
18522129-6	We conclude that OHCs are present in the serum of pregnant women , and all compounds tested are transferred over the placenta .	1 122 12
18522129-7	Because transfer is occurring at a critical stage of infant development , investigation of the health impact is urgent .	
17889848-0	Amazonian gold mining activity results in human exposure to mercury vapor .	
17889848-1	We evaluated the visual system of two Amazonian gold miners ( 29 and 37 years old ) by recording the transient pattern electroretinogram ( tPERG ) and transient pattern visual evoked potential ( tPVEP ) .	11 1 112
17889848-2	We compared these results with those obtained from a regional group of control subjects .	
17889848-3	For both tPERG and tPVEP , checkerboards with 0.5 or 2 cycles per degree ( cpd ) of spatial frequency were presented in a 16 degrees squared area , 100% Michelson contrast , 50cd/m2 mean luminance , and 1 Hz square-wave pattern-reversal presentation .	
17889848-4	Two averaged waveforms ( n=240 sweeps , 1s each ) were monocularly obtained for each subject in each condition .	
17889848-5	Both eyes were monocularly tested only in gold miners .	
17889848-6	Normative data were calculated using a final pooled waveform with 480 sweeps .	
17889848-7	The first gold miner , LCS , had normal tPERG responses .	
17889848-8	The second one , RNP , showed low tPERG ( P50 component ) amplitudes at 0.5 cpd for both eyes , outside the normative data , and absence of response at 2 cpd for his right eye .	
17889848-9	Delayed tPVEP responses ( P100 component ) were found at 2 cpd for LCS but the implicit times were inside the normative data .	
17889848-10	Subject RNP also showed delayed tPVEP responses ( all components ) , but only the implicit time obtained with his right eye was outside the normative data at 2 cpd .	
17889848-11	We conclude that mercury exposure levels found in the Amazon gold miners is high enough to damage the visual system and can be assessed by non-invasive electrophysiological techniques .	
9842745-0	Twenty primary schools in three areas ( Merebank , Austerville and Bluff ) of south-central Durban , South Africa were studied to determine if dust lead loading ( microgram/m2 ) is high enough to constitute a risk to children .	
9842745-1	Atmospheric lead fallout rates in the schools varied from 9 to 264 micrograms/m2 per day and were higher than the values now being reported in the developed countries .	
9842745-2	Mean outside dust lead loadings were 425 micrograms/m2 in Merebank , 771 micrograms/m2 in Austerville and 1174 micrograms/m2 in Bluff areas , and 25% of the primary schools were found to have mean outside dust lead loading above 1000 micrograms/m2 .	
9842745-3	Mean dust lead loadings inside classrooms were 2-4 times lower than the outside rates , and showed no significant difference among schools in the three areas .	24 2 242
9842745-4	Dust lead loadings were correlated with lead concentrations in dust but not with distance from the highway or with atmospheric lead deposition rates .	
9842745-5	Exposure to dust lead in classrooms and in the school yard is considered to be an important contributor to blood lead levels in , and hence a potential health hazard to , children in many urban areas of the city .	24 2 242
17851450-0	A pilot observational exposure study was performed to evaluate methods for collecting multimedia measurements ( air , dust , food , urine ) and activity patterns to assess potential exposures of young children to pesticides in their homes .	24 12 23 242 1 2 243 127
17851450-1	Nine children ( mean age=5 years ) and their caregivers participated in this study , performed in the Duval County , Florida , in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Duval County Health Department .	24 12 23 242 1 244 2 243 127 232
17851450-2	For all nine children , the total time reported for sleeping and napping ranged from 9.5 to 14 h per day , indoor quiet time from 0 to 5.5 h per day , indoor active time from 0.75 to 5.5 h per day , outdoor quiet time from 0 to 1.5 h per day , and outdoor active time from 0.5 to 6.5 h per day .	
17851450-3	Each home had one to three pesticide products present , with aerosols being most common .	24 244 2
17851450-4	Pesticide inventories , however , were not useful for predicting pesticide levels in the home .	
17851450-5	Synthetic pyrethroids were the most frequently identified active ingredients in the products present in each home .	
17851450-6	Fifteen pesticide active ingredients were measured in the application area wipes ( not detected ( ND ) to 580 ng/cm(2) ) , 13 in the play area wipes ( ND-117 ng/cm(2) ) , and 14 in the indoor air samples ( ND-378 ng/m(3) ) and the socks ( ND-1000 ng/cm(2) ) .	24 2 232 242 23
17851450-7	Cis-permethrin , trans-permethrin , and cypermethrin were measured in all nine homes .	
17851450-8	Chlorpyrifos was measured in all nine homes even though it was not reported used by the participants .	
17851450-9	All urine samples contained measurable concentrations of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ( 3-PBA ) .	1 12 127
17851450-10	The median 3-PBA urinary concentration for the nine children was 2.2 mug/l .	1 12 127
17851450-11	A wide variety of pesticide active ingredients were measured in these nine homes at median concentrations that were often higher than reported previously in similar studies .	
17851450-12	These data highlight the need for additional observational studies in regions where pesticides are used in order to understand the factors that affect young children's exposures and the education/mitigation strategies that can be used to reduce children's exposures .	
17851449-0	Dental amalgam is a mercury-based filling containing approximately 50% of metallic mercury ( Hg(0) ) .	
17851449-1	Human placenta does not represent a real barrier to the transport of Hg(0) ; hence , fetal exposure occurs as a result of maternal exposure to Hg , with possible subsequent neurodevelopmental disabilities in infants .	
17851449-2	This study represents a substudy of the international NIH-funded project " Early Childhood Development and polychlorinated biphenyls Exposure in Slovakia " .	
17851449-3	The main aim of this analysis was to assess the relationship between maternal dental amalgam fillings and exposure of the developing fetus to Hg .	24 244 2
17851449-4	The study subjects were mother-child pairs ( N=99 ) .	
17851449-5	Questionnaires were administered after delivery , and chemical analyses of Hg were performed in the samples of maternal and cord blood using atomic absorption spectrometry with amalgamation technique .	1 122 12
17851449-6	The median values of Hg concentrations were 0.63 microg/l ( range 0.14-2.9 microg/l ) and 0.80 microg/l ( range 0.15-2.54 microg/l ) for maternal and cord blood , respectively .	
17851449-7	None of the cord blood Hg concentrations reached the level considered to be hazardous for neurodevelopmental effects in children exposed to Hg in utero ( EPA reference dose for Hg of 5.8 microg/l in cord blood ) .	
17851449-8	A strong positive correlation between maternal and cord blood Hg levels was found ( rho=0.79 ; P&lt;0.001 ) .	
17851449-9	Levels of Hg in the cord blood were significantly associated with the number of maternal amalgam fillings ( rho=0.46 , P&lt;0.001 ) and with the number of years since the last filling ( rho=-0.37 , P&lt;0.001 ) ; these associations remained significant after adjustment for maternal age and education .	24 244 2
17851449-10	Dental amalgam fillings in girls and women of reproductive age should be used with caution , to avoid increased prenatal Hg exposure .	
9830609-0	Respiratory symptoms , lung function , and radiographic changes among 100 actively employed electricians in Edmonton , Alberta , Canada , with 20 or more years of union membership were compared with those of 100 telephone workers .	
9830609-1	Posteroanterior chest radiographs were evaluated by two experienced chest physicians , with a third arbitrating films that were disagreed upon .	
9830609-2	Employment in a number of industrial sectors was compared for time and for time-weighted exposure to dust and fumes .	2 23
9830609-3	Compared with telephone workers , electricians had more usual cough ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 3.36 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.36-8.31 ) , usual phlegm ( OR = 2.44 ; 95% CI , 1.01-5.86 ) , chronic phlegm ( OR = 2.74 ; 95% CI , 1.13-6.60 ) , and shortness of breath ( OR = 2.26 ; 95% CI , 1.10-4.67 ) , but no differences in lung function .	11 1 112
9830609-4	The prevalence of radiographic changes in both groups was low .	
9830609-5	The electricians had more radiographic changes , but only for the category " any change " was the difference statistically significant ( OR = 5.2 ; 95% CI , 1.06-23.93 ) .	
9830609-6	Only two electricians had small irregular opacities .	
9830609-7	Phlegm , chronic phlegm , and chest tightness were significantly associated with cumulative exposure to fumes in the gas and oil industry and to total industrial construction .	2 23
9810721-0	The preservation of lead within human tissue makes it possible to monitor long-term exposure to the element and to model changing sources of lead pollution throughout the lifetime of an individual .	
9810721-1	Dental tissues have recently been shown to be particularly useful for this purpose .	
9810721-2	Enamel , for instance , forms at known stages of life and is chemically stable in vivo whereas dentine is remodelled in a predictable fashion .	
9810721-3	The relative stability of enamel is reflected in its excellent post-mortem preservation .	
9810721-4	This raises the possibility of using historical or archaeological material to reconstruct long-term trends and establish baseline data relating to exposure among pre-industrial or even prehistoric populations .	
9810721-5	The use of archaeological material is currently problematic , however , because of the site-specific nature of diagenesis and incomplete understanding of its chemistry , particularly in respect of lead uptake into dental tissue from the burial environment .	
9810721-6	A detailed study of lead distribution within both ancient and modern human teeth is presented .	1 12 125
9810721-7	Conclusions are drawn on the pattern of lead distribution resulting from tissue formation and the manner of its alteration in the burial environment .	
9810721-8	In particular , attention is drawn to a consistent enrichment of lead within the outer 30 microns of the enamel of both ancient and modern teeth which appears to be unrelated to diagenesis .	1 12 125
9810721-9	The implications for current approaches to long-term monitoring and for the reconstruction of historical and archaeological exposure patterns are discussed .	
18678038-0	In 2000 , 3M Company , the primary global manufacturer , announced a phase-out of perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride ( POSF , C8F17SO2F)-based materials after perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS , C8F17SO3- ) was reported in human populations and wildlife .	
18678038-1	The purpose of this study was to determine whether PFOS and other polyfluoroalkyl concentrations in plasma samples , collected in 2006 from six American Red Cross adult blood donor centers , have declined compared to nonpaired serum samples from the same locations in 2000-2001 .	1 122 12
18678038-2	For each location , 100 samples were obtained evenly distributed by age ( 20-69 years ) and sex .	
18678038-3	Analytes measured , using tandem mass spectrometry , were PFOS , perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , perfluorohexanesulfonate ( PFHxS ) , perfluorobutanesulfonate ( PFBS ) , N-methyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate ( Me-PFOSA-AcOH ) , and N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetate ( Et-PFOSA-AcOH ) .	
18678038-4	The geometric mean plasma concentrations were for PFOS 14.5 ng/mL ( 95% CI 13.9-15.2 ) , PFOA 3.4 ng/ mL ( 95% CI 3.3-3.6 ) , and PFHxS 1.5 ng/mL ( 95% CI 1.4-1.6 ) .	1 122 12
18678038-5	The majority of PFBS , Me-PFOSA-AcOH , and Et-PFOSA-AcOH concentrations were less than the lower limit of quantitation .	
18678038-6	Age- and sex-adjusted geometric means were lower in 2006 ( approximately 60% for PFOS , 25% for PFOA , and 30% for PFHxS ) than those in 2000-2001 .	
18678038-7	The declines for PFOS and PFHxS are consistent with their serum elimination half-lives and the time since the phase-out of POSF-based materials .	
18678038-8	The shorter serum elimination half-life for PFOA and its smaller percentage decline than PFOS suggests PFOA concentrations measured in the general population are unlikely to be solely attributed to POSF-based materials .	
18678038-9	Direct and indirect exposure sources of PFOA could include historic and ongoing electrochemical cell fluorination ( ECF ) of PFOA , telomer production of PFOA , fluorotelomer-based precursors , and other fluoropoly-mer production .	
9801023-0	For estimating reliable exposure-response relations it is necessary that random variation in both the response and the exposure variables be sufficiently small .	
9801023-1	Variability in cumulative exposures can arise from uncertainties in self-reported work histories from interviews .	
9801023-2	In most epidemiologic surveys , the information gathered from questionnaires is used without knowing the validity or reproducibility of these data .	
9801023-3	This paper investigates the reliability of occupational histories reported by the same individuals on two occasions separated by 9 years in the US National Study of Coal Workers ' Pneumoconiosis and its implications on the exposure-response relation for simple coal workers ' pneumoconiosis .	2 232 23
9801023-4	For 480 coal miners , from whom occupational histories were obtained twice ( in 1969-1971 and 1977-1981 ) , the reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient ) of the cumulative exposures generated from each work history was 87% .	2 21
9801023-5	Logistic model fitting of simple coal workers ' pneumoconiosis prevalence to the cumulative coal dust exposure produced almost identical results .	2 232 23
9801023-6	After accounting for intersurvey variability in the occupational histories , the authors found that the exposure-response coefficients estimated from information reported at the surveys were attenuated by 12% .	
9801023-7	In epidemiologic studies , knowledge of the reproducibility of self-reported occupational history information is important to ascertain whether the true exposure effect is underestimated .	
17764717-0	The aim of the present study was to understand the placental transfer of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , specific hydroxylated PCB metabolites ( OH-PCBs ) , and pentachlorophenol ( PCP ) in blood serum , in a birth cohort from eastern Slovakia .	1 122 12
17764717-1	During the period 2002-2004 , cord blood specimens were collected in parallel with maternal specimens from women delivering in the two eastern Slovak districts of Michalovce and Svidnik/Stropkov .	1 122 12
17764717-2	A total of 92 pairs of mother-cord specimens at delivery were selected for this study. 4-OH-CB107 , 3-OH-CB153 , 4-OH-CB146 , 3'-OH-CB138 , 4-OH-CB187 , and 4'-OH-CB172 were quantified .	
17764717-3	The median concentrations of Sigma(17)PCBs , Sigma(6)OH-PCBs , and PCP in cord serum were 0.92 , 0.33 , and 0.69 ng/g wet wt. , respectively and highly correlated with the corresponding maternal serum levels ( correlations were R(2)=0.61 , 0.78 , and 0.82 , respectively ) .	1 122 12
17764717-4	The median cord to mother ratios of the Sigma(17)PCBs , Sigma(6)OH-PCBs , and PCP were 0.18 , 0.75 , and 1.10 , respectively .	
17764717-5	The median ratio of the Sigma(6)OH-PCBs to the Sigma(17) PCBs in the cord serum was 0.38 from wet weight based concentrations , which was about four times higher than the ratio of these compounds in maternal serum ( 0.09 ) .	
17764717-6	PCP was more abundant than any PCB or OH-PCB congener measured in cord serum .	
17764717-7	The higher cord to maternal ratios of OH-PCB metabolites as compared with the parent compounds suggests either a higher placental transfer rate or greater metabolism in the fetus as compared with the maternal compartment .	
17764717-8	These findings are consistent with their preferential binding to TTR that can cross the placenta .	
17764717-9	The cord to maternal ratio varies by congener ( e.g. , 4-OH-CB107=0.58 , 4-OH-CB146=0.74 , 3'-OH-CB138=1.01 ) .	
18767701-0	To learn the extent of human exposure to polyfluoroalkyl compounds ( PFCs ) in a remote fishing population , we measured , in Faroese children and pregnant women , the serum concentrations of nine PFCs , including perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , and perfluorononanoate ( PFNA ) , by using online solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .	24 12 1 122 2 243
18767701-1	The serum samples analyzed had been collected between 1993 and 2005 from 103 children 7 years of age , 79 of these children at 14 years of age , and from 12 pregnant women and their children 5 years later .	1 122 12
18767701-2	PFOS was detected in all samples analyzed , and both PFOA and PFNA were detected in all but one of the samples .	
18767701-3	The concentrations found are comparable tothose reported elsewhere .	
18767701-4	Correlations between paired concentrations were poor .	
18767701-5	However , PFOS and PFNA concentrations correlated well with the frequency of pilotwhale dinners and with concentrations of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls .	24 2 243
18767701-6	One whale meal every two weeks increased the PFOS concentration in 14-year-olds by about 25% and PFNA by 50% .	24 2 243
18767701-7	The high frequency of detection of most PFCs suggests widespread exposure in the Faroe Islands already by the early 1990s , with whale meat being an important source .	
23786648-0	Engineered nanoparticles ( ENP ) are increasingly used to functionalize textiles taking advantage , e.g. , of the antimicrobial activity of silver ( Ag)-ENP or the UV-absorption of titania ( TiO2)-ENP .	
23786648-1	Mobilization and migration of ENPs from the textile into human sweat can result in dermal exposure to these nanoobjects and their aggregates and agglomerates ( NOAA ) .	
23786648-2	In this study we assessed exposure to NOAA migrating from commercially available textiles to artificial sweat by an experimental setup that simulates wear-and-tear during physical activity .	
23786648-3	By combining physical stress with incubation in alkaline and acidic artificial sweat solutions we experimentally realized a worst case scenario for wearing functionalized textiles during sports activities .	
23786648-4	This experimental approach is not limited to NOAA , but can be used for any other textile additive .	
23786648-5	Out of four investigated textiles , one T-shirt and one pair of trousers with claimed antimicrobial properties were found to release Ag &lt;450 nm in detectable amounts ( 23-74 Î¼g/g/L ) .	
23786648-6	Textiles containing TiO2 for UV protection did not release significant amounts of TiO2 &lt;450 nm , but the antimicrobial T-shirt released both TiO2 and Ag &lt;450 nm .	
23786648-7	The silver was present in dissolved and particulate form , whereas TiO2 was mainly found as particulate .	
23786648-8	On the basis of our experimental results we calculated external dermal exposure to Ag and TiO2 for male and female adults per use .	2 22
23786648-9	For silver , maximal amounts of 17.1 and 8.2 Î¼g/kg body weight were calculated for total and particulate Ag &lt;450 nm , respectively .	
23786648-10	For TiO2 , the exposure levels amount to maximal 11.6 Î¼g/kg body weight for total ( mainly particulate ) TiO2 .	2
23786648-11	In comparison with other human exposure pathways , dermal exposure to NOAA from textiles can be considered comparably minor for TiO2-NOAA , but not for Ag-NOAA .	24 244 2 22
9778177-0	The detection of mutagenic and carcinogenic chlorination by-products in chlorinated drinking water has raised concern in many countries over the potential health effects of long-term exposure to these products .	
9778177-1	The relation between estimated exposure to historical drinking water mutagenicity and cancer was studied in Finland by using a population-based case-control study comprising 732 bladder cancer cases , 703 kidney cancer cases , and 914 controls .	24 2 241
9778177-2	The cases were obtained from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry for the years 1991-1992 .	
9778177-3	The controls , frequency matched by age and sex , were randomly selected from the national population registry .	
9778177-4	Information on past drinking water sources and confounding factors was acquired through a questionnaire .	24 2 241
9778177-5	Historical exposure to drinking water mutagenicity was estimated by using information on past residence , past water source , and historical data on water quality and treatment .	24 2 241
9778177-6	Odds ratios were calculated for an increase of 3,000 net revertants per liter ( net rev/liter ) in average exposure from 1950 to 1987 , adjusting for age , sex , socioeconomic status , and smoking in logistic regression models .	
9778177-7	A small , statistically significant , exposure-related excess risk was found for kidney cancer for men ( odds ratio = 1.49 , 95 percent confidence interval ( CI ) 1.05-2.13 ) for 3,000 net rev/liter exposure level .	
9778177-8	For women , the association remained nonsignificant , with a lower odds ratio of 1.08 ( 95% CI 0.69-1.68 ) .	
9778177-9	For bladder cancer , the odds ratio for both men and women was 1.22 ( 95% CI 0.92-1.62 ) for 3,000 net rev/liter exposure .	
9778177-10	However , a higher odds ratio of 2.59 ( 95% CI 1.13-5.94 ) for 3,000 net rev/liter exposure was observed for male nonsmokers .	
23787103-0	In this study , the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) in soil profiles and the soil properties were analyzed in Hunpu , a typical wastewater irrigation area , northeast of China .	
23787103-1	The total concentrations of 16 priority control PAHs ranged from 7.88 to 2,231.42 Î¼g/kg .	
23787103-2	Among 16 PAHs , the most abundant was Phenanthrene and the 3- or 4- ring PAHs were predominant .	
23787103-3	The PAH concentrations were higher in the upland fields near the oil wells , whereas leaching of PAH into the groundwater caused low concentrations in the paddy fields .	
23787103-4	The geochemical indices and the results from the principal component analysis of all 16 PAHs indicated that PAHs were mainly from atmospheric dusts in the top soil in I-1P/I-3P/I-7P and through soil profiles in I-4U/I-5P/I-8U , whereas those in the bottom layers were mainly from petroleum production and wastewater irrigation in I-1P/I-3P/I-7P and through soil profiles in I-2U and I-6U .	
23787103-5	In the redundancy analysis , PAHs exhibited negative correlation with pH , depth , silt , and clay , but had positive correlation with sand and organic matter .	
23787103-6	Finally , total toxic equivalent in the soil profiles and the calculated health risk of PAHs in the surface soil using contaminated land exposure assessment model elucidated the cancer risk that PAHs pose on human health in the Hunpu region .	245 24 2
18817946-0	Mercury [ Hg ] emissions from old plant collections treated with mercuric chloride ( HgCl(2) ) may present a high health risk for staff working in certain herbaria .	
18817946-1	The present study evaluated Hg concentrations in ambient air , plant specimens and biological samples from staff working in the Pretoria National Herbarium ( PRE ) and the H.G.W.J. Schweickerdt Herbarium ( PRU ) , University of Pretoria .	
18817946-2	Biological samples from a group of 15 people exposed to HgCl(2) in herbaria and a non-exposed control group of five people were studied .	
18817946-3	Additionally , plant samples from herbarium specimens treated and non-treated with HgCl(2) were analysed .	
18817946-4	Plant materials treated with HgCl(2) had persistent high concentrations of Hg in the range of 114-432 microg g(-1) , whereas untreated materials were in the range of 0.20-0.45 microg g(-1) .	
18817946-5	The HgCl(2)-treated plant specimens induced elevated concentrations of Hg into the herbarium rooms near storage cabinets , where up to 1 microg m(-3) of Hg was measured in the air of both herbaria .	2 232 23
18817946-6	However , no significant difference in mean Hg concentrations in hair was found between herbarium workers and members of the control group , 0.46 and 0.64 microg g(-1) respectively ( p0.05 , Student's t-test ) .	1 123 12
18817946-7	For both groups , Hg concentrations were lower than that indicated by the World Health Organization [ WHO ] for non-exposed adults , namely 2 microg g(-1) .	
18817946-8	The mean concentration of total Hg in urine from the mercury-exposed herbarium group , 2.28 microg g(-1) creatinine , was significantly higher than in the control group , 1.05 microg g(-1) of creatinine .	1 12 127
18817946-9	For both populations , the concentrations of Hg in their urine were below the threshold Hg values set by the WHO , i.e. , 5 microg g(-1) creatinine .	
18817946-10	We concluded that there was no strong response by individual herbarium staff from long-term exposure to Hg concentrations in the range of 0.28-1.1 microg m(-3) .	
23787566-0	OBJECTIVE Evidence linking short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution with hemorrhagic stroke is inconclusive .	
23787566-1	METHODS We evaluated the effects of suspended particulate matter ( SPM ) on cardiovascular disease mortality , focusing on types of stroke , from March 2005 to December 2010 , in five selected prefectures in western Japan .	
23787566-2	A multicity time-series analysis was used , and Asian dust was adjusted in the models .	
23787566-3	RESULTS Even after adjusting for Asian dust , the same-day SPM was positively associated with several types of stroke mortality .	
23787566-4	Following a 10-Î¼g/m increase in SPM , rate ratios were 1.014 ( 90% confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.002 to 1.026 ) for stroke , 1.030 ( 90% CI : 1.004 to 1.056 ) for intracerebral hemorrhage , and 1.016 ( 90% CI : 1.003 to 1.030 ) for ischemic stroke mortality .	
23787566-5	CONCLUSIONS Short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution may increase the risks of hemorrhagic stroke as well as ischemic stroke mortality .	2 231 23
17660003-0	BACKGROUND Endocrine dysfunction related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid ( HPT ) and/or the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis ( HPG ) is being discussed as underlying developmental adversity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .	
17660003-1	This study was done to evaluate effects related to the HPG axis .	
17660003-2	METHODS A birth-cohort study was initiated in the year 2000 .	
17660003-3	Healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited in the industrialized city of Duisburg , Germany .	
17660003-4	Dioxins , dioxin-like PCBs and six indicator PCBs were measured in maternal blood during pregnancy and in maternal milk .	1 122 12 124
17660003-5	Testosterone and estradiol levels were measured in maternal and cord serum of 104 mother-infant pairs representing a subsample with a complete data set of the total basic sample of 232 participants .	11 1 1112 111 11121
17660003-6	Linear regression analysis was used to describe the association of PCDD/Fs or PCB in maternal blood or milk with sex steroid concentrations after adjustment for confounding .	11 1 1112 111 11121
17660003-7	RESULTS Median concentrations for PCDD/Fs in maternal blood fat and milk fat in terms of WHO-TEq were 15.3 and 13.1pg WHO-TEq/g , respectively , and for the sum of the indicator PCBs ( #28 , #52 , #101 , #138 , #153 , #180 ) 149 and 177ng/g .	1 122 12
17660003-8	The adjusted ratio of geometric means when doubling the concentration of PCDD/Fs in maternal blood fat was 0.86 , 95% confidence interval ( 95% CI ) : 0.72-1.03 for testosterone and 0.73 ( 0.61-0.87 ) for estradiol in cord serum .	
17660003-9	Typically , testosterone reduction was more pronounced in cord serum of female and estradiol reduction in that of male babies .	
17660003-10	Reduction of hormone levels was generally more pronounced for dioxins than for indicator PCBs .	1 11 1112 111
17660003-11	CONCLUSIONS The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of newborn babies is influenced by prenatal exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs in a manner suggestive of AhR-mediation .	
17660003-12	The clinical relevance of this finding remains to be established , however .	
18845316-0	OBJECTIVES This study is to examine the effect of cadmium exposure on blood pressure in Korean general population .	
18845316-1	METHODS The study population consisted of 958 men and 944 women who participated in the 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES ) , in which blood pressure and blood cadmium were measured from each participant .	11 1 122 12 112
18845316-2	RESULTS The mean blood cadmium level was 1.67 microg/L ( median level 1.55 ) .	1 122 12
18845316-3	The prevalence of hypertension was 26.2% .	
18845316-4	The blood cadmium level was significantly higher among those subjects with hypertension than those without ( mean level 1.77 versus 1.64 microg/dL ) .	
18845316-5	After adjusting for covariates , the odds ratio of hypertension comparing the highest to the lowest tertile of cadmium in blood was 1.51 ( 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.05 ) , and a dose-response relationship was observed .	1 11 112
18845316-6	Systolic , diastolic , and mean arterial blood pressure were all positively associated with blood cadmium level , and this effect of cadmium on blood pressure was markedly stronger when the kidney function was reduced .	
18845316-7	CONCLUSIONS Cadmium exposures at the current level may have increased the blood pressure of Korean general population .	
9750945-0	BACKGROUND Construction boilermakers may be exposed to a variety of substances , including asbestos and welding fumes .	
9750945-1	Past studies of boilermakers have shown increases in mortality from lung cancer and asbestosis and radiographic changes consistent with asbestos exposure .	
9750945-2	METHODS Respiratory symptoms , lung function , and radiographic changes were compared for 102 actively employed boilermakers with 20 or more years of union membership and 100 telephone workers .	
9750945-3	Posteroanterior chest radiographs were evaluated by two experienced chest physicians , with a third arbitrating disagreed films .	
9750945-4	Union members were further categorized as boilermakers ( n = 50 ) or welders ( n = 52 ) , based on longest service .	
9750945-5	Lung health was also compared with employment in a number of work sectors for time , and time-weighted exposure to dust and fumes .	2 23
9750945-6	RESULTS Boilermakers had more respiratory symptoms than telephone workers , but lung function did not differ .	
9750945-7	Radiographic changes were more common among the boilermakers ( 20% with any change , 8% circumscribed , and 9% diffuse pleural thickening ) .	
9750945-8	None of the boilermakers had small radiographic opacities .	
9750945-9	Several symptoms suggestive of bronchial responsiveness were associated with fume exposures in the gas and oil industry .	2 23
9750945-10	Workers whose longest service was as a boilermaker demonstrated more symptoms than did welders .	
9750945-11	FEV1 , FEV1/FVC , FEF25-75 , and FEF50 were significantly lower among boilermakers compared with welders .	
9750945-12	CONCLUSION Health screening programs for these workers are warranted .	
23818037-0	BACKGROUND In this study we describe a general-population job-exposure matrix ( MatEmESp ) for Spanish workers covering the period 1996-2005 .	2 21
23818037-1	METHODS The Finnish job-exposure matrix ( FINJEM ) provided the default value estimates for occupational exposure to chemical , physical and biological agents .	2 21
23818037-2	These estimates were adapted to Spanish working conditions by local experts .	
23818037-3	Spanish surveys were used to obtain exposure estimates for ergonomic and psychosocial risk factors .	
23818037-4	Employment and socio-demographic conditions for Spanish workers were obtained from the Spanish National Statistics Institute .	
23818037-5	RESULTS MatEmESp provides a large amount of national and occupation-specific data on the major occupational exposures in Spain .	
23818037-6	As some examples , the data show that the most prevalent occupational hazards are repetitive movements and a lack of support from co-workers .	
23818037-7	In addition , 10% of the Spanish working population perform night shifts , and bricklayers and concrete workers are the job titles with the highest risk of exposure to quartz dust .	
23818037-8	CONCLUSIONS MatEmESp can be a useful tool for research and surveillance , and can help set priorities for occupational illness and injury prevention in Spain .	
18939566-0	Traffic-related air pollutants have been associated with adverse health effects .	
18939566-1	We hypothesized that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , elemental carbon ( EC , diesel indicator ) , particulate matter ( PM2.5 ) , and a suite of metals declined from 1998 to 2006 in NYC due to policy interventions .	
18939566-2	PAH levels from personal monitoring of pregnant mothers participating in the Columbia's Center for Children's Environmental Health birth cohort study , and EC , PM2.5 , and metal data from five New York State Department of Environmental Conservation stationary monitors were compared across sites and over time ( 1998-2006 ) .	23 2 233
18939566-3	Univariate analysis showed a decrease in personal PAHs exposures from 1998 to 2006 ( p &lt ; 0.0001 ) .	2 233 23
18939566-4	After controlling for environmental tobacco smoke , indoor heat , and cooking , year of personal monitoring remained a predictor of decline in sigmaPAHs ( beta = -0.269 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
18939566-5	Linear trend analysis also suggested that PM2.5 declined ( p = 0.09 ) .	
18939566-6	Concentrations of EC and most metals measured by stationary site monitors , as measured by ANOVA , did not decline .	
18939566-7	Across stationary sites , levels of airborne EC and metals varied considerably .	
18939566-8	By contrast PM2.5 levels were highly intercorrelated ( values ranged from 0.725 to 0.922 , p &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
18939566-9	Further policy initiatives targeting traffic-related air pollutants may be needed for a greater impact on public health .	
17508260-0	To estimate exposure to cadmium ( Cd ) and lead ( Pb ) through cigarette smoking , the concentrations of both metals in the blood or/and urine of smokers ( 20 cigarettes or more per day for 10 years or longer ) and their non-smoking counterparts inhabiting an environmentally unpolluted area ( Bialystok , Poland ) were evaluated , as well as Cd and Pb contents in the cigarette brands ( produced in Poland ) smoked by the participants , including intact cigarettes , pre-smoking ( tobacco , paper and filter ) and post-smoking ( butt , ash and smoke ) cigarette components .	12 23 1 122 2 127 232
17508260-1	Blood and urinary Cd concentrations in the smokers have been already reported by us to be 2-4 times higher than in the non-smokers ( Galazyn-Sidorczuk et al .	1 122 12 127
17508260-2	Polish Journal of Environmental Studies , 13 ( Suppl.1):91-95 , 2004 ) .	
17508260-3	All the other measurements are the subject of the present paper .	
17508260-4	Pb concentration in the blood of the cigarette smokers ( 52.12 +/- 15.51 microg l(-1) ) was higher by 29% than in the non-smokers ( 40.42 +/- 11.19 microg l(-1) ) .	1 122 12
17508260-5	The mean Cd and Pb contents in the cigarettes were 0.6801 +/- 0.1765 and 0.6853 +/- 0.0746 microg per cigarette , respectively .	
17508260-6	Under cigarette burning , performed using a machine for self-acting burning , on average 33% of Cd and 11% of Pb present in the whole cigarette was released into the smoke .	
17508260-7	For Cd , unlike Pb , there was a high positive correlation between the metal content in cigarettes and tobacco and its release into the smoke .	
17508260-8	Moreover , the subjects smoking cigarettes containing the highest Cd amount had higher blood Cd concentration than smokers of other cigarette brands .	
17508260-9	The results give clear evidence that in the case of inhabitants of areas unpolluted with Cd and Pb habitual cigarette smoking , due to tobacco contamination , creates a serious source of chronic exposure to these metals , especially to Cd .	
23820848-0	BACKGROUND Evidence suggests that air pollution is associated with atherosclerosis and that traffic-related particles are a particularly important contributor to the association .	
23820848-1	OBJECTIVES We investigated the association between long-term exposure to black carbon , a correlate of traffic particles , and intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery ( CIMT ) in elderly men residing in the greater Boston , Massachusetts , area .	1 11 112
23820848-2	METHODS We estimated 1-year average exposures to black carbon at the home addresses of Normative Aging Study participants before their first CIMT measurement .	2 231 23
23820848-3	The association between estimated black carbon levels and CIMT was estimated using mixed effects models to account for repeated outcome measures .	
23820848-4	In secondary analyses , we examined whether living close to a major road or average daily traffic within 100 m of residence was associated with CIMT .	
23820848-5	RESULTS There were 380 participants ( 97% self-reported white race ) with an initial visit between 2004 and 2008 .	
23820848-6	Two or three follow-up CIMT measurements 1.5 years apart were available for 340 ( 89% ) and 260 ( 68% ) men , respectively .	
23820848-7	At first examination , the average Â± SD age was 76 Â± 6.4 years and the mean Â± SD CIMT was 0.99 Â± 0.18 mm .	
23820848-8	A one-interquartile range increase in 1-year average black carbon ( 0.26 Âµg/m3 ) was associated with a 1.1% higher CIMT ( 95% CI : 0.4 , 1.7% ) based on a fully adjusted model .	
23820848-9	CONCLUSIONS Annual mean black carbon concentration based on spatially resolved exposure estimates was associated with CIMT in a population of elderly men .	
23820848-10	These findings support an association between long-term air pollution exposure and atherosclerosis .	2 23
17458512-0	Simultaneous indoor and outdoor PM10 and PM2.5 concentration measurements were conducted in seven primary schools in the Athens area .	2 232 23
17458512-1	Both gravimetric samplers and continuous monitors were used .	
17458512-2	Filters were subsequently analyzed for anion species .	
17458512-3	Moreover ultrafine particles number concentration was monitored continuously indoors and outdoors .	
17458512-4	Mean 8-hr PM10 concentration was measured equal to 229 +/- 182 microg/m3 indoors and 166 +/- 133 microg/m3 outdoors .	
17458512-5	The respective PM2.5 concentrations were 82 +/- 56 microg/m3 indoors and 56 +/- 26 microg/m3 outdoors .	
17458512-6	Ultrafine particles 8-h mean number concentration was measured equal to 24,000 +/- 17,900 particles/cm3 indoors and 32,000 +/- 14,200 particles/cm3 outdoors .	
17458512-7	PM10 outdoor concentrations exhibited a greater spatial variability than the corresponding PM2.5 ones .	
17458512-8	I/O ratios were close or above 1.00 for PM10 and PM2.5 and smaller than 1.00 for ultrafine particles .	
17458512-9	Very high I/O ratios were observed when intense activities took place .	
17458512-10	The initial results of the chemical analysis showed that SO4(-2) accounts for the 6.6 +/- 3.5% of the PM10 and NO3(1) for the 3.1 +/- 1.4%.The corresponding results for PM2.5 are 12.0 +/- 7.7% for SO4(-2) and 3.1 +/- 1.9% for NO3- .	
17458512-11	PM2.5 SO4(-2) indoor concentrations were highly correlated with outdoor ones and the regression line had the largest slope and a very low intercept , indicative of no indoor sources of fine particulate SO4(-2) .	
17458512-12	The results of the statistical analysis of indoor and outdoor concentration data support the use of SO4(-2) as a proper surrogate for indoor PM of outdoor origin .	
23820868-0	BACKGROUND Air pollution and obesity are hypothesized to contribute to accelerated decline in lung function with age through their inflammatory properties .	
23820868-1	OBJECTIVE We investigated whether the previously reported association between improved air quality and lung health in the population-based SAPALDIA cohort is modified by obesity .	
23820868-2	METHODS We used adjusted mixed-model analyses to estimate the association of average body mass index ( BMI ) and changes in particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter â¤ 10 Âµm ( PM10 ; ÎPM10 ) with lung function decline over a 10-year follow-up period .	
23820868-3	RESULTS Lung function data and complete information were available for 4,664 participants .	1 11 112
23820868-4	Age-related declines in lung function among participants with high average BMI were more rapid for FVC ( forced vital capacity ) , but slower for FEV1/FVC ( forced expiratory volume in 1 sec/FVC ) and FEF25-75 ( forced expiratory flow at 25-75% ) than declines among those with low or normal average BMI .	1 11 112
23820868-5	Improved air quality was associated with attenuated reductions in FEV1/FVC , FEF25-75 , and FEF25-75/FVC over time among low- and normal-BMI participants , but not overweight or obese participants .	2 23
23820868-6	The attenuation was most pronounced for ÎFEF25-75/FVC ( 30% and 22% attenuation in association with a 10-Î¼g/m3 decrease in PM10 among low- and normal-weight participants , respectively. )	
23820868-7	CONCLUSION Our results point to the importance of considering health effects of air pollution exposure and obesity in parallel .	2 23
23820868-8	Further research must address the mechanisms underlying the observed interaction .	
9721256-0	The research presented in this article assessed geochemical factors relating to dust produced during primary lead smelting .	
9721256-1	Bulk dust samples and size-selective airborne dust samples were collected from four areas of a primary lead smelter and analyzed by X-ray diffraction and sequential chemical extraction .	24 2 232 242 23
9721256-2	X-ray diffraction showed that the smelter dusts were composed primarily of sulfides , oxides , sulfates , and silicates of metal ores , with galena being the primary dust component .	24 2 242
9721256-3	Sequential extraction revealed the solubility of lead compounds at less than 7% in the exchangeable and mildly acidic steps for the bulk dusts collected from four smelter areas .	24 2 242
9721256-4	The later steps of the extraction procedure were more effective in dissolving the lead compounds associated with the bulk dust samples , with 43% , 26% , and 8% of the total lead , in the ore storage , sinter , and blast/dross smelter areas , respectively , being extracted in the residual step .	
9721256-5	Sequential extraction of coarse airborne dust samples from the ore storage and sinter plant showed that 1.2% and 4.1% of the total lead , respectively , was exchangeable .	24 23 2 242
9721256-6	The finer particle size fractions from these areas of the smelter showed higher percentages of exchangeable lead .	
9721256-7	Of the course airborne dust from the blast/dross furnace processes , 65% of the total lead was exchangeable .	
9721256-8	However , the largest percentage of lead from these areas was associated with the finer particle-size fractions .	
9721256-9	If lead bioavailability is related to its solubility as determined through sequential extraction , the health hazards associated with lead exposure may be appreciably enhanced in the blast and dross furnace processes .	
19027142-0	Arsenic ( As ) poisoning has become a worldwide public health concern .	
19027142-1	The skin is quite sensitive to As and skin lesions are the most common and earliest nonmalignant effects associated to chronic As exposure .	
19027142-2	In 2005-2007 , a survey was carried out on surface and groundwater arsenic contamination and relationships between As exposure via the drinking water and related adverse health effects ( melanosis and keratosis ) on villagers resides on the banks of Manchar lake , southern part of Sindh , Pakistan .	1 11 112
19027142-3	We screened the population from arsenic-affected villages , 61 to 73% population were identified patients suffering from chronic arsenic toxicity .	
19027142-4	The effects of As toxicity via drinking water were estimated by biological samples ( scalp hair and blood ) of adults ( males and females ) , have or have not skin problem ( n=187 ) .	24 12 1 122 123 241 2
19027142-5	The referent samples of both genders were also collected from the areas having low level of As ( &lt;10 microg/L ) in drinking water ( n=121 ) .	
19027142-6	Arsenic concentration in drinking water and biological samples were analyzed using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry .	
19027142-7	The range of arsenic concentrations in lake surface water was 35.2-158 microg/L , which is 3-15 folds higher than World Health Organization [ WHO , 2004 .	
19027142-8	Guidelines for drinking-water quality third ed. , WHO Geneva Switzerland. ] .	
19027142-9	It was observed that As concentration in the scalp hair and blood samples were above the range of permissible values 0.034-0.319 microg As/g for hair and &lt;0.5-4.2 microg/L for blood .	1 12 122 123
19027142-10	The linear regressions showed good correlations between arsenic concentrations in water versus hair and blood samples of exposed skin diseased subjects ( R2=0.852 and 0.718 ) as compared to non-diseased subjects ( R2=0.573 and 0.351 ) , respectively .	
19031915-0	An improved extraction ( ion pairing ) and cleanup ( ENVI-carb and solid phase extraction ) method was developed for analysis of perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) in human whole blood samples from China .	1 122 12
19031915-1	Ten PFCs including PFOS , PFHxS , PFOSA , PFDoDA , PFUnDA , PFDA , PFNA , PFOA , PFHpA , and PFHxA were detected in the blood samples ( n=30 ) from five cities ( Jintan , Nanjing , Guiyang , Beijing , and Shenyang ) .	1 122 12
19031915-2	PFOS was found to be the dominant PFC ranging from 0.446-83.1 ng/mL .	
19031915-3	Total fluorine ( TF ) and extractable organic fluorine ( EOF ) also were measured in the blood samples using combustion ion chromatography for fluorine .	1 122 12
19031915-4	Analysis of known PFCs and extractable organic fluorine showed that known PFCs could account for &gt;70% of EOF in samples from Beijing , Shenyang , and Guiyang , whereas known PFCs could only account for approximately 30% of EOF in samples from Jintan .	
19031915-5	Results of the present study indicated the presence of substantial amounts of unidentified organic fluorine in human blood samples from Jintan .	1 122 12
19031915-6	Characterization and identification of these unidentified fluorinated compounds will be instructive .	
17426733-0	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers , PBDEs , are a class of brominated flame retardants that , like other persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) , have been found in humans , wildlife , and biota worldwide .	
17426733-1	Unlike other POPs , however , the key routes of human exposure are not thought to be food and fish , but rather are from their use in household consumer products , and to the high levels of PBDEs found in house dust .	
17426733-2	The exposure of Americans to PBDEs was systematically evaluated in this study .	
17426733-3	First , exposure media data on PBDE congeners were compiled .	
17426733-4	Then , an adult intake dose was derived using exposure factors in combination with these data .	
17426733-5	The exposure pathways evaluated included food and water ingestion , inhalation , and ingestion and dermal contact to house dust .	24 23 2 241 243 242
17426733-6	These intakes were converted to a body burden using a simple pharmacokinetic ( PK ) model .	2 21
17426733-7	The predicted body burdens were compared with representative profiles of PBDEs in blood and milk .	1 122 12 124
17426733-8	The adult intake dose of total PBDEs was estimated to be 7.7 ng/kg body weight/day , and children's estimated intakes were higher at 49.3 ng/kg/day for ages 1-5 , 14.4 ng/kg/day for 6-11 , and 9.1 ng/kg/day for 12-19 .	24 2 241 243 242
17426733-9	The much higher dose for the child age 1-5 was due to the doubling of dust ingestion from 50 to 100 mg/day .	24 2 242
17426733-10	The predicted adult body burden of total PBDEs was 33.8 ng/kg lipid weight ( lwt ) , compared to representative measurements in blood and milk at 64.0 and 93.7 ng/g lwt , respectively Most of this apparent underprediction in total concentration was due to an underprediction of the key congener , BDE 47 .	
17426733-11	The value for BDE 47 half-life in the body was identified as the variable most likely in error in this exercise .	
17426733-12	Other congener predictions compared well with measurements , suggesting general validity with the approach .	
17426733-13	An important finding from this assessment is that the food intake estimate of about 1.3 ng/kg/day ( of the 7.7 ng/kg/day total ) cannot explain current US body burdens ; exposures to PBDEs in house dust accounted for 82% of the overall estimated intakes .	24 2 243 242
23838152-0	BACKGROUND Decreased heart rate variability ( HRV ) has been associated with future cardiac morbidity and mortality and is often used as a marker of altered cardiac autonomic balance in studies of health effects of airborne particulate matter .	11 1 112
23838152-1	Fewer studies have evaluated associations between air pollutants and cardiac arrhythmia .	
23838152-2	OBJECTIVES We examined relationships between cardiac arrhythmias , HRV , and exposures to airborne particulate matter .	11 1 2 112 23
23838152-3	METHODS We measured HRV and arrhythmia with ambulatory electrocardiograms in a cohort panel study for up to 235 hr per participant among 50 nonsmokers with coronary artery disease who were â¥ 71 years of age and living in four retirement communities in the Los Angeles , California , Air Basin .	
23838152-4	Exposures included hourly outdoor gases , hourly traffic-related and secondary organic aerosol markers , and daily size-fractionated particle mass .	2 231 23
23838152-5	We used repeated measures analyses , adjusting for actigraph-derived physical activity and heart rate , temperature , day of week , season , and community location .	
23838152-6	RESULTS Ventricular tachycardia was significantly increased in association with increases in markers of traffic-related particles , secondary organic carbon , and ozone .	1 11 112
23838152-7	Few consistent associations were observed for supraventricular tachycardia .	
23838152-8	Particulates were significantly associated with decreased ambulatory HRV only in the 20 participants using ACE ( angiotensin I-converting enzyme ) inhibitors .	
23838152-9	CONCLUSIONS Although these data support the hypothesis that particulate exposures may increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia for elderly people with coronary artery disease , HRV was not associated with exposure in most of our participants .	
23838152-10	These results are consistent with previous findings in this cohort for systemic inflammation , blood pressure , and ST segment depression .	
9647904-0	In this paper , we present results from the SAPALDIA study ( Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Lung Diseases in Adults ) regarding associations between lung function [ forced vital capacity ( FVC ) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1) ] , as assessed during the cross-sectional study in 1991 , and average levels of NO2 exposure within the eight study communities .	1 11 112
9647904-1	We distinguished average home outdoor exposure and average personal exposure to NO2 and obtained exposure estimates by computing regional averages of passive sampler measurements performed by a random subsample of SAPALDIA participants in 1993 .	2 233 23
9647904-2	Previous analyses had revealed associations between average lung function and average air pollution levels between communities .	
9647904-3	The present results show that such associations may also be seen within communities : a 10-micrograms per m3 increase in average home outdoor and personal exposure to NO2 between zones of residence of the same community was associated with a change in average FVC by -0.59% [ 95% confidence limits ( CL ) = 0.01 , -1.19 ] and -0.74% ( 95% CL = -0.07 , -1.41 ) , respectively .	2 233 23
9647904-4	These values , however , are smaller than the ones found for the corresponding associations between study communities : -1.67% ( 95% CL = -1.01 , -2.33 ) and -2.93% ( 95% CL = -2.11 , -3.75 ) , respectively .	
9647904-5	The different magnitudes of these two types of associations might be explained by differences in spatial variation between various components of air pollution .	
23842601-0	BACKGROUND Environmental determinants of appendicitis are poorly understood .	
23842601-1	Past work suggests that air pollution may increase the risk of appendicitis .	
23842601-2	OBJECTIVES We investigated whether ambient ground-level ozone ( O3 ) concentrations were associated with appendicitis and whether these associations varied between perforated and nonperforated appendicitis .	
23842601-3	METHODS We based this time-stratified case-crossover study on 35,811 patients hospitalized with appendicitis from 2004 to 2008 in 12 Canadian cities .	
23842601-4	Data from a national network of fixed-site monitors were used to calculate daily maximum O3 concentrations for each city .	2 231 23
23842601-5	Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate city-specific odds ratios ( ORs ) relative to an interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in O3 adjusted for temperature and relative humidity .	
23842601-6	A random-effects meta-analysis was used to derive a pooled risk estimate .	
23842601-7	Stratified analyses were used to estimate associations separately for perforated and nonperforated appendicitis .	
23842601-8	RESULTS Overall , a 16-ppb increase in the 7-day cumulative average daily maximum O3 concentration was associated with all appendicitis cases across the 12 cities ( pooled OR = 1.07 ; 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.13 ) .	2 231 23
23842601-9	The association was stronger among patients presenting with perforated appendicitis for the 7-day average ( pooled OR = 1.22 ; 95% CI : 1.09 , 1.36 ) when compared with the corresponding estimate for nonperforated appendicitis [ 7-day average ( pooled OR = 1.02 , 95% CI : 0.95 , 1.09) ] .	
23842601-10	Heterogeneity was not statistically significant across cities for either perforated or nonperforated appendicitis ( p &gt ; 0.20 ) .	
23842601-11	CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of ambient O3 exposure may increase the risk of perforated appendicitis .	
9646530-0	Pediatric heavy metal ( particularly lead ) poisoning is a widespread , yet preventable problem in many parts of the world .	
9646530-1	Interior floor dust is found to be one of the major pathways of childhood exposure .	
9646530-2	However , school and health authorities in most countries do not have any stipulations nor guidelines in regulating heavy metal contamination in floor dusts in schools .	24 2 242
9646530-3	This study attempts to examine the level of heavy metal contamination in 53 nursery schools and kindergartens in Hong Kong and study its relationship with the environmental factors .	
9646530-4	The results of this study reveal that the arithmetic mean level of lead in exterior dust is 280.01 mg/kg , with a minimum level of 48.80 mg/kg and a maximum of 2108.31 mg/kg , which is somewhat lower than other studies , such as those reported by Chan et al .	24 2 242

9646530-7	Sci. 1989;2:131-140 ) and Akhter and Madany ( Water Air Soil Pollut. 1993;66:111-119 ) , but those of the manganese ( mean = 532.16 mg/kg , range = 102.51-1736.25 mg/kg ) and zinc levels ( mean = 2694.23 mg/kg , range = 898.33-9899.85 mg/kg ) are much higher .	
9646530-8	Out of the 10 districts examined , Kwun Tong and North Point are found to be the most polluted .	
9646530-9	They are older districts with polluting industries and heavy traffic .	
9646530-10	The results of the analysis of variance suggest that the heavy metal particulate may originate from the exterior .	
9646530-11	Auto-vehicles are a likely source .	
9646530-12	The toxins are blown inside through the opened windows .	
9646530-13	Other factors that may affect the content of metal in floor dusts are the time since the school was last painted , the age of the housing complex , the condition of the school and the use of vacuum cleaners .	
23849834-0	Synthetic musks ( SMs ) have been widely used as fragrance ingredients in personal care and sanitary commodities .	
23849834-1	Due to their high volatility and particle-binding affinity , the indoor dust is a major reservoir of SMs , and dust ingestion could be an important exposure way to special populations , such as hairdressers .	
23849834-2	In spite of the known toxicity of SMs , there is no information regarding the occurrence of SMs in barbershop dusts and the exposure of hairdressers through indoor dust ingestion .	
23849834-3	In the present study , the levels of two nitro musks and five polycyclic musks were measured from indoor dust samples collected from barbershops , and some other indoor dust samples were also collected from dormitories , bathhouses and households for comparison .	24 2 242
23849834-4	The concentrations of âSMs in barbershop dusts were 10-100 times higher than those from the other three indoor microenvironments .	24 2 242
23849834-5	Polycyclic musks accounted for 89.4% of âSMs on average in all samples , of which two compounds , HHCB and AHTN jointly dominated 97.9% of polycyclic musks .	
23849834-6	The levels of HHCB and AHTN varied from 12.2 to 8.39Ã10(5) and from 13.2 to 3.49Ã10(5) ng g(-1) , respectively .	
23849834-7	The daily intakes ( DIs ) of âSMs through house dust ingestion were estimated using the model of high dust ingestion and worst-case exposure ( P95 ) , and the corresponding exposure rates were 2791 , 135 and 727 ng d(-1) for the hairdressers , general population and toddlers .	24 2 242
23849834-8	SMs were also detected in blood samples collected from the hairdressers and normal adults ( n=50 and 10 , respectively ) .	1 122 12
23849834-9	There was no significant difference between these two groups .	
23849834-10	Despite the absence of higher SM concentrations in hairdresser's blood , we should not overlook the potential occupational health risks due to their high SMs ingestion rate .	1 122 12
9600800-0	The present study aimed to evaluate methylmercury in fish and human hair samples from an important hydroelectrical reservoir , Balbina ( Brazil , Amazon ) .	1 123 12
9600800-1	It presents a quite intense fishing activity and there is no known goldmining activity in its watershed .	
9600800-2	Fish and human hair were analyzed with a new extraction technique and measured by GC-ECD .	1 123 12
9600800-3	Analytical quality was checked through intercomparisons between two laboratories with local samples and certified standards from IAEA .	
9600800-4	Methylmercury in hair ranged from 2.0 to 21.6 microg . g-1 with a mean of 8.76+/-5.20 microg . g-1 ( N=20 ) , while the methylmercury percentages were above 90 .	
9600800-5	Fish presented methylmercury levels ranging from 0.03 to 0.9 microg small middle dot g-1 wet wt with a mean of 0.24+/-0.18 microg small middle dot g-1 wet wt ( N=32 ) , which is below the limit established for food by Brazilian legislation ( 0.5 microg small middle dot g-1 wet wt ) and methylmercury mean percentages were above 95% .	
9600800-6	The total mean daily methylmercury intake ranged from 11 to 55 microg for 70% of the sampled population from the village based on a daily consumption of about 110 g of fish with methylmercury concentrations in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 microg . g-1 .	24 2 243
9600800-7	This calculation is consistent with methylmercury concentrations in hair samples in the range of 2.6 to 13.1 microg . g-1 .	1 123 12
23872246-0	Lifetime exposure to disinfection byproducts ( DBPs ) in municipal water may pose risks to human health .	
23872246-1	Current approaches of exposure assessments use DBPs in cold water during showering , while warming of chlorinated water during showering may increase trihalomethane ( THM ) formation in the presence of free residual chlorine .	
23872246-2	Further , DBP exposure through dermal contact during showering is estimated using steady-state condition between the DBPs in shower water impacting on human skin and skin exposed to shower water .	24 2 241 22
23872246-3	The lag times to achieve steady-state condition between DBPs in shower water and human skin can vary in the range of 9.8-391.2 min , while shower duration is often less than the lag times .	
23872246-4	Assessment of exposure without incorporating these factors might have misinterpreted DBP exposure in some previous studies .	
23872246-5	In this study , exposure to THMs through ingestion was estimated using cold water THMs , while THM exposure through inhalation and dermal contact during showering was estimated using THMs in warm water .	24 2 241 22 23
23872246-6	Inhalation of THMs was estimated using THM partition into the shower air , while dermal uptake was estimated by incorporating lag times ( e.g. , unsteady and steady-state phases of exposure ) during showering .	2 22 232 23
23872246-7	Probabilistic approach was followed to incorporate uncertainty in the assessment .	
23872246-8	Inhalation and dermal contact during showering contributed 25-60% of total exposure .	2 22 232 23
23872246-9	Exposure to THMs during showering can be controlled by varying shower stall volume , shower duration and air exchange rate following power law equations .	
23872246-10	The findings might be useful in understanding exposure to THMs , which can be extended to other volatile compounds in municipal water .	
9618348-0	The associations among daily counts of intrauterine mortality and pollutant concentrations ( NO2 , SO2 , CO , O3 , and particulate matter ( 3/4)10 microm ) were investigated for the period ranging from January 1991 to December 1992 in the city of SÃ£o Paulo , Brazil .	2 231 23
9618348-1	We used Poisson regression techniques , adjusted for season and weather .	
9618348-2	The association between intrauterine mortality and air pollution was strong for NO2 ( coefficient = 0.0013/ microg/m3 ; p&lt;0.01 ) but lesser for SO2 ( coefficient = 0.0005/ microg/m3 ; p&lt;0.10 ) and CO ( coefficient = 0.0223/ppm ; p&lt;0.10 ) .	2 23
9618348-3	A significant association was observed when an index that combined these three pollutants was considered in the models instead of considering each pollutant individually ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
9618348-4	These associations exhibited a short time lag , not over 5 days .	2 231 23
9618348-5	In addition , some evidence of fetal exposure to air pollution was obtained by disclosing a significant association between the levels of carboxyhemoglobin of blood sampled from the umbilical cord and ambient CO levels in children delivered by nonsmoking pregnant women in the period from May to July 1995 .	12 23 1 122 2 231
9618348-6	Our results suggest that air pollution in SÃ£o Paulo may promote adverse health effects on fetuses .	
22208757-0	A total of 27 per- and polyfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) were determined in both house dust ( n=10 ) and indoor air ( n=10 ) from selected homes in Catalonia , Spain .	24 2 232 242 23
22208757-1	Concentrations were found to be similar or lower than those previously reported for household microenvironments in other countries .	
22208757-2	Ten PFCs were detected in all house dust samples .	24 2 242
22208757-3	The highest mean concentrations corresponded to perfluorodecanoic acid ( PFDA ) and perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) , 10.7 ng/g ( median : 1.5 ng/g ) and 10.4 ng/g ( median : 5.4 ng/g ) , respectively , while the 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol ( FTOH ) was the dominating neutral PFC at a concentration of 0.41 ng/g ( median : 0.35 ng/g ) .	
22208757-4	The indoor air was dominated by the FTOHs , especially the 8:2 FTOH at a mean ( median ) concentration of 51 pg/m(3) ( median : 42 pg/m(3) ) .	2 232 23
22208757-5	A limited number of ionic PFCs were also detected in the indoor air samples .	2 232 23
22208757-6	Daily intakes of PFCs were estimated for average and worst case scenarios of human exposure from indoor sources .	2
22208757-7	For toddlers , this resulted in average intakes of âionic PFCs of 4.9ng/day ( 0.33 ng/kg(bw)/day for a 15 kg toddlers ) and âneutral PFCs of 0.072 ng/day ( 0.005 ng/kg(bw)/day ) from house dust .	24 2 242
22208757-8	For adults , the average daily intakes of dust were 3.6 and 0.053 ng/day ( 0.05 and 0.001 ng/kg(bw)/day for a 70 kg adult ) for âionic and âneutral PFCs , respectively .	24 2 242
22208757-9	The average daily inhalation of âneutral PFCs was estimated to be 0.9 and 1.3 ng/day ( 0.06 and 0.02 ng/kg(bw)/day ) for toddlers and adults , respectively .	2 232 23
22208757-10	For PFOS , the main ionic PFC detected in indoor air samples , the median intakes ( based on those samples where PFOS was detected ) , resulted in indoor exposures of 0.06 and 0.11 ng/day ( 0.004 and 0.002 ng/kg(bw)/day ) for toddlers and adults , respectively .	2 232 23
22208757-11	Based on previous studies on dietary intake and drinking water consumption , both house dust and indoor air contribute significantly less to PFC exposure within this population .	
19118595-0	The objective of this study was to examine the effects of environmental cadmium ( Cd ) exposure on the gene expression profile of peripheral blood cells , using an original oligoDNA microarray .	1111 1 111 11
19118595-1	The study population consisted of 20 female residents in a Cd-polluted area ( Cd-exposed group ) and 20 female residents in a non-Cd-polluted area individually matched for age ( control group ) .	
19118595-2	The mRNA levels in Cd-exposed subjects were compared with those in respective controls , using a microarray containing oligoDNA probes for 1867 genes .	
19118595-3	Median Cd concentrations in blood ( 3.55 microg/l ) and urine ( 8.25 microg/g creatinine ) from the Cd-exposed group were 2.4- and 1.9-times higher than those of the control group , respectively .	1 122 12 127
19118595-4	Microarray analysis revealed that the Cd-exposed group significantly up-regulated 137 genes and down-regulated 80 genes , compared with the control group .	1111 1 111 11
19118595-5	The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Application ( IPA ) revealed that differentially expressed genes were likely to modify oxidative stress and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways .	1111 1 111 11
19118595-6	Among differentially expressed genes , the expression of five genes was positively correlated with Cd concentrations in blood or urine .	1 122 12 127
19118595-7	Quantitative real-time PCR ( RT-PCR ) analysis validated the significant up-regulation of CASP9 , TNFRSF1B , GPX3 , HYOU1 , SLC3A2 , SLC19A1 , SLC35A4 and ITGAL , and down-regulation of BCL2A1 and COX7B .	
19118595-8	After adjustment for differences in the background characteristics of the two groups , we finally identified seven Cd-responsive genes ( CASP9 , TNFRSF1B , GPX3 , SLC3A2 , ITGAL , BCL2A1 , and COX7B ) , all of which constituted a network that controls oxidative stress response by IPA .	
19118595-9	These seven genes may be marker genes useful for the health risk assessment of chronic low level exposure to Cd .	1111 1 111 11
19126424-0	Although the concentrations of the toxic metal cadmium in breast milk are generally low ( &lt ; 1 microg/L ) , experimental studies indicated neurobehavioral and endocrine effects in the suckling offspring .	
19126424-1	The aim of the present study was to elucidate how cadmium is transported to breast milk by assessing interactions with essential micronutrients .	
19126424-2	The study is nested into a food and micronutrient supplementation trial conducted among pregnant women in Matlab , a rural area in Bangladesh , where malnutrition is prevalent and the cadmium exposure is relatively high .	1 122 12 127
19126424-3	We measured cadmium in breast milk ( BM-Cd ; median 0.14 microg/kg ; range &lt;0.050-1.0 microg/kg ) , in erythrocytes ( Ery-Cd ; median 1.5 microg/kg ; range 0.46-4.8 microg/kg ) and in urine ( U-Cd ; median 0.63 microg/L ; range 0.050-4.5 microg/L ) , using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICPMS ) .	1 122 12 124 127
19126424-4	We found a significant positive association between Ery-Cd and BM-Cd and a breast milk-plasma ratio of approximately 3-4 , indicating no barrier against cadmium transport from plasma to breast milk .	1 122 12 124
19126424-5	BM-Cd was positively associated with manganese ( r(s)=0.56 ; p&lt;0.01 ) and iron ( r(s)=0.55 ; p&lt;0.01 ) in breast milk , but not with plasma ferritin .	
19126424-6	On the other hand , BM-Cd was negatively associated with BM-Ca ( r(s)=-0.17 ; p=0.05 ) , indicating that cadmium inhibits the transport of calcium to breast milk .	
19126424-7	In conclusion , the present study may indicate that cadmium shares common transporters with iron and manganese for transfer to breast milk , but inhibits secretion of calcium to breast milk .	
22208742-0	Flame retardant dechlorane plus ( DP ) and several polybrominated diphenylether ( PBDE ) congeners have been measured in 87 human milk samples collected in two Canadian cities : Kingston and Sherbrooke .	1 12 124
22208742-1	The levels of PBDEs in human milk ( mean ( median ) , ng g(-1) lipid weight=10 ( 5.9 ) , 4.1 ( 2.8 ) , 3.0 ( 1.6 ) , 5.12 ( 1.6 ) , and 15 ( ND ) for BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , and BDE-209 , respectively ) were comparable to those reported in Europe , U.S.A. and China .	1 12 124
22208742-2	The levels of DP , with a mean value of 0.98 ng g(-1) and a median value of 0.60 ng g(-1) ( lipid weight ) , were two to ten times lower than those of concurrently measured major PBDEs including BDE-209 .	
22208742-3	While there is little difference in the levels of measured contaminants in milk samples collected from the two cities , the contaminants levels in human milk show , indicated by Principal Components Analysis , that DP , deca-BDE , and penta-BDE come from three distinct sources .	1 12 124
22208742-4	The mean and median isomer ratio values of DP in milk were 0.67 and 0.69 , respectively , very similar to that of DP commercial products .	
19192827-0	This study investigated the association between dietary variables and plasma levels of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid ( PFOS ) and perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) among 1076 pregnant women .	1 122 12
19192827-1	Diet was assessed at midpregnancy by a food-frequency questionnaire .	24 2 243
19192827-2	Mean first trimester plasma PFOS and PFOA levels were 35.1 and 5.6 ng/mL respectively .	1 122 12
19192827-3	PFOS levels were positively associated ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) with intake of red meat , animal fats , and snacks ( e.g. , popcorn , potato chips ) , whereas intake of vegetables and poultry was inversely associated .	24 2 243
19192827-4	The adjusted mean differences between the 75th and 25th intake percentiles were 4.3 ng/mL [ 95% CI : 2.1 , 6.5 ] for red meat 3.4 ng/mL [ 95% CI : 1.2 , 5.6 ] for animal fats , and 2.0 ng/mL [ 95% CI : 0.3 , 3.6 ] for snacks .	
19192827-5	Similar but weaker associations were observed for PFOA .	
19192827-6	Furthermore , a comparison between women reporting low ( &lt ; or =25th percentile ) red meat and high ( &gt ; or =75th percentile ) vegetable intake and women reporting low vegetable and high red meat intake resulted in differences in plasma PFOS and PFOA concentrations equal to 31% and 18% of mean levels , respectively .	
19192827-7	Studies quantifying levels of perfluorinated compounds in food have suggested that diet could be an important route of human exposure .	
19192827-8	The observed associations in our study between dietary variables and maternal exposure further support that conclusion .	24 2 243
22208737-0	BACKGROUND We monitored urinary benzene excretion to examine factors affecting benzene uptake in a sample of the general population living near a petrochemical plant .	
22208737-1	METHODS Our study population included 143 subjects : 33 petrochemical plant workers ( W ) with low level occupational benzene exposure ; 30 residents in a small town 2 km from the plant ( 2kmR ) ; 26 residents in a second small town located 2 to 4 km from the plant ( 4kmR ) ; and 54 urban residents 25km from the plant ( 25kmR ) .	
22208737-2	Exposure to benzene was evaluated by personal air sampling during one work-shift for the W group , and from 8.00 to 20:00 for general population subgroups , and by urinary benzene ( BEN-U ) .	12 23 1 2 127 233
22208737-3	RESULTS Median airborne benzene exposure was 25 , 9 , 7 and 6 Î¼g/m(3) benzene among the W , 2kmR , 4kmR , and 25kmR subgroups , respectively ; the highest level was found among the workers , while there was no significant difference among the other groups .	2 23
22208737-4	Median BEN-U was 2 to 14-fold higher in smokers compared to non-smokers ; among non-smokers BEN-U was the highest in W ( median 236 ng/L ) , and lower in the 2kmR ( 48 ng/L ) and 4kmR ( 63 ng/L ) subgroups than in the 25kmR ( 120 ng/L ) subgroup .	
22208737-5	A multiple linear regression analysis , explaining up to 73% of BEN-U variability , confirmed that active smoking and airborne benzene most strongly affected BEN-U .	
22208737-6	Among the non-smoking , non-occupationally exposed study subjects , a positive association was found between BEN-U and the distance of residence from the plant .	
22208737-7	This association was explained by increased exposure to urban traffic emissions in the study group residing at a greater distance from the plant .	
22208737-8	Environmental tobacco smoke had a marginally positive role .	
22208737-9	CONCLUSION Among factors affecting benzene uptake in non-occupationally exposed individuals , urban residence contributes to benzene exposure more than residing in close proximity to a petrochemical plant .	
23912598-0	BACKGROUND Parabens are preservatives commonly used in personal care products , pharmaceuticals , and foods .	
23912598-1	There is documented widespread human exposure to parabens , and some experimental data suggest that they act as estrogenic endocrine disruptors .	
23912598-2	As far as we are aware , no epidemiologic studies have assessed female reproductive health effects in relation to paraben exposure .	
23912598-3	OBJECTIVE We examined the association of urinary paraben concentrations with markers of ovarian reserve in a prospective cohort study of women seeking fertility treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts .	11 1 12 127
23912598-4	METHODS Measures of ovarian reserve were day-3 follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , antral follicle count ( AFC ) , and ovarian volume .	11 1 11123 111 112 1112
23912598-5	Paraben concentrations [ methylparaben ( MP ) , propylparaben ( PP ) , and butylparaben ( BP) ] were measured in spot urine samples collected prior to the assessment of outcome measures .	1 12 127
23912598-6	We used linear and Poisson regression models to estimate associations of urinary paraben concentrations ( in tertiles ) with ovarian reserve measures .	1 12 127
23912598-7	RESULTS Of the women enrolled in 2004-2010 , 192 had at least one ovarian reserve outcome measured ( mean age Â± SD , 36.1 Â± 4.5 years ; range , 21.0-46.7 years ) .	
23912598-8	MP and PP were detected in &gt ; 99% of urine samples and BP in &gt ; 75% .	1 12 127
23912598-9	We found a suggestive trend of lower AFC with increasing urinary PP tertiles [ mean percent change ( 95% CI ) for tertiles 2 and 3 compared with tertile 1 , respectively , were -5.0% ( -23.7 , 18.4 ) and -16.3% ( -30.8 , 1.3 ) ; trend p-value ( ptrend ) = 0.07 ] as well as higher day-3 FSH with higher urinary PP tertiles [ mean change ( 95% CI ) for tertiles 2 and 3 compared with tertile 1 were 1.16 IU/L ( -0.26 , 2.57 ) and 1.02 IU/L ( -0.40 , 2.43 ) ; ptrend = 0.16 ] .	
23912598-10	We found no consistent evidence of associations between urinary MP or BP and day-3 FSH or AFC , or between urinary MP , PP , or BP and ovarian volume .	
23912598-11	CONCLUSIONS PP may be associated with diminished ovarian reserve .	
23912598-12	However , our results require confirmation in further studies .	
22197513-0	The aim of this study is to evaluate personal exposure to As in urban air in two groups of outdoor workers ( traffic policemen and police drivers ) of a big Italian city through : ( a ) environmental monitoring of As obtained by personal samples and ( b ) biological monitoring of total urinary As .	12 23 1 2 127 233
22197513-1	The possible influence of smoking habit on urinary As was evaluated .	
22197513-2	We studied 122 male subjects , all Municipal Police employees : 84 traffic policemen and 38 police drivers exposed to urban pollutants .	
22197513-3	Personal exposure to As in air was significantly higher in traffic policemen than in police drivers ( p=0.03 ) .	23 2 233
22197513-4	Mean age , length of service , alcohol drinking habit , number of cigarettes smoked/day and BMI were comparable between the groups of subjects studied .	
22197513-5	All subjects were working in the same urban area where they had lived for at least 5 yrs .	
22197513-6	Dietary habits and consumption of water from the water supply and/or mineral water were similar in traffic policemen and in police drivers .	
22197513-7	The values of total urinary As were significantly higher in traffic policemen ( smokers and non smokers ) than in police drivers ( smokers and non smokers ) ( p=0.02 ) .	
22197513-8	In the subgroup of non-smokers the values of total urinary As were significantly higher in traffic policemen than in police drivers ( p=0.03 ) .	
22197513-9	In traffic policemen and in police drivers total urinary As values were significantly correlated to the values of As in air ( respectively r=0.9 and r=0.8 , p&lt;0.001 ) .	
22197513-10	This is the first research in literature studying the exposure to As in outdoor workers occupationally exposed to urban pollutants , such as traffic policemen and police drivers .	
22197513-11	Personal exposure to As in the air , as well as the urinary excretion of As , is significantly higher in traffic policemen compared to drivers .	12 23 1 2 127 233
22197513-12	These results can provide information about exposure to As in streets and in car for other categories of outdoor workers similarly exposed .	
9521180-0	To investigate the validity of outdoor particulate matter with a 50% cutoff diameter of 10-microm ( PM10 ) concentrations as a measure of exposure in time series studies , the association between personal and outdoor concentrations , within subjects , over time was investigated .	2 233 23
9521180-1	Repeated measurements of personal , indoor , and outdoor PM10 were conducted among 37 nonsmoking , 50- to 70-year-old adults , living in Amsterdam , Netherlands , 1994 .	2 233 232 23
9521180-2	Regression analyses were conducted for each subject separately , and the distribution of the individual regression and correlation coefficients was investigated .	
9521180-3	Furthermore , the extent to which differences among personal , indoor , and outdoor concentrations could be explained was studied .	
9521180-4	The median Pearson's R between personal and outdoor concentrations was 0.50 .	
9521180-5	Excluding days with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) improved the correlation to a median R of 0.71 .	
9521180-6	The estimated cross-sectional correlations were lower , 0.34 and 0.50 , respectively .	
9521180-7	Outdoor concentrations ( mean , 42 microg/m3 ) exceeded indoor concentrations ( mean , 35 microg/m3 ) but underestimated personal exposures ( mean , 62 microg/m3 ) .	2 233 232 23
9521180-8	The major part of the difference between personal and outdoor concentrations could be attributed to exposure to ETS , living along a busy road , and time spent in a vehicle .	
9521180-9	The results show a reasonably high correlation between personal and outdoor PM10 within individuals , providing support for the use of ambient PM10 concentrations as a measure of exposure in epidemiologic studies linking the day-to-day variation in particulate matter air pollution to the day-to-day variation in health endpoints such as mortality , hospital admissions , respiratory symptoms , and lung function .	2 231 23
22192840-0	Environmental exposure to cadmium ( Cd ) is known to induce oxidative stress , a state of imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and the ability to detoxify them , in adults .	
22192840-1	However , data are lacking on potential effects in early-life .	
22192840-2	We evaluated urinary concentrations of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodG ) , a recognized marker of oxidative DNA damage , in relation to Cd exposure in 96 predominantly breast-fed infants ( 11-17 weeks of age ) in rural Bangladesh .	11 1 12 1111 11122 1112 111 1114 127
22192840-3	Urinary 8-oxodG was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and Cd in urine and breast milk by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .	1 12 124 127
22192840-4	Median concentration of 8-oxodG was 3.9 nmol/L , urinary Cd 0.30 Î¼g/L , and breast-milk Cd 0.13 Î¼g/L .	1 12 124 127
22192840-5	In linear regression analyses , urinary 8-oxodG was positively associated with Cd in both urine ( p=0.00067 ) and breast milk ( p=0.0021 ) , and negatively associated with body weight ( kg ; p=0.0041 ) .	
22192840-6	Adjustment for age , body weight , socio-economic status , urinary arsenic , as well as magnesium , calcium , and copper in breast milk did not change the association between Cd exposure and urinary 8-oxodG .	
22192840-7	These findings suggest that early-life low-level exposure to Cd via breast milk induces oxidative stress .	
22192840-8	Further studies are warranted to elucidate whether this oxidative stress is associated with impaired child health and development .	
22192581-0	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDE ) are used in high amounts as flame retardants in plastic materials and textiles .	
22192581-1	Due to their persistence , their accumulation in the food chain and their toxic properties they have been integrated in the human biomonitoring program of the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg State Health Office since 2002 .	
22192581-2	In repeated cross-sectional studies in winter 2002/03 ( n=162 ) , 2004/05 ( n=194 ) , 2005/06 ( n=411 ) and 2008/09 ( n=770 ) blood samples of 9-11-year-old pupils were taken , pooled and analysed for PBDE after extraction and purification by silica gel using HRGC/HRMS .	1 122 12
22192581-3	Samples were pooled according to region , gender , and breast feeding .	
22192581-4	PBDE in the pooled samples ranged from 1.9 to 12.5 ng/g blood fat ( sum of all PBDE ) .	
22192581-5	Mean concentrations of PBDE , calculated for the four investigation periods , were 6.2 ng/g ( 2002/03 ) , 5.4 ng/g ( 2004/05 ) , 7.8 ng/g ( 2005/06 ) and 6.7 ng/g ( 2008/09 ) .	
22192581-6	While the concentration of the decabrominated diphenyl ether ( BDE-209 ) increased , the concentration of other congeners ( BDE-47 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , BDE-154 , BDE-183 ) decreased slightly or remained at the same level .	
22192581-7	Consistent differences with respect to gender and breast-feeding were not recognizable .	
22192581-8	Concentrations of PBDE in children range on the same level as in adults and do not seem to be critical from the toxicological point of view .	1 122 12
22192581-9	Because of the slight increase of BDE 209 , the internal concentrations of BDE should be monitored in the future .	
22192581-10	The strong variations in PBDE concentration between the different pooled samples indicate that , apart from ingestion , other routes of exposure ( dermal , inhalation ) and additional sources ( textiles , building materials ) must be taken into consideration .	
9504280-0	Trihalomethanes ( chloroform , bromoform , bromodichloromethane , and chlorodibromomethane ) are common contaminants of chlorinated drinking water .	
9504280-1	Although animal data indicate that these compounds may be reproductive toxicants , little information exists on their relation to spontaneous abortion in humans .	
9504280-2	We examined exposure to trihalomethanes and spontaneous abortion in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women in a prepaid health plan .	11 24 1 2 241 112
9504280-3	Seventy-eight drinking water utilities provided concurrent trihalomethane sampling data .	24 2 241
9504280-4	We calculated total trihalomethane levels by averaging all measurements taken by the subject's utility during her first trimester .	
9504280-5	We calculated exposures to individual trihalomethanes in an analogous manner .	
9504280-6	Women who drank &gt ; or = 5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing &gt ; or = 75 micrograms per liter total trihalomethanes had an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of 1.8 for spontaneous abortion [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.1-3.0 ] .	24 2 241
9504280-7	Of the four individual trihalomethanes , only high bromodichloromethane exposure ( consumption of &gt ; or = 5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing &gt ; or = 18 micrograms per liter bromodichloromethane ) was associated with spontaneous abortion both alone ( adjusted OR = 2.0 ; 95% CI = 1.2-3.5 ) and after adjustment for the other trihalomethanes ( adjusted OR = 3.0 ; 95% CI = 1.4-6.6 ) .	
16084569-0	BACKGROUND Much attention has been paid to the level of dioxins in breast milk in Japan but few large-scale studies have been conducted on the subject .	1 12 124
16084569-1	METHODS From 1997 to 2002 , we collected 839 samples of breast milk from primiparas residing throughout Japan .	
16084569-2	Starting in 1999 , breast milk was also collected from secundiparas .	1 12 124
16084569-3	Seven isomers of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , 10 of polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , 4 of coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) and 8 of mono-orthochlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls ( mono-ortho PCBs ) were analyzed by employing gas chromatography and mass spectrometry .	
16084569-4	A correlation between the level of dioxins in human milk and the age of the mothers was noted for the primiparas and the secundiparas ; and the levels were compared between the first and the second deliveries .	1 12 124
16084569-5	Grouped by parity and prefecture in each year , observations were also made on the trends in these levels .	
16084569-6	Dioxin levels are shown by using geometric means because their distributions were skewed to the left .	
16084569-7	RESULTS The sum of PCDDs and PCDFs , Co-PCBs , mono-ortho PCBs , and total dioxins in the breast milk of primiparas were 13.9 , 5.4 , 3.4 , and 22.7 pg TEQ/g fat , respectively .	
16084569-8	In the samples obtained from secundiparas , these levels were 63-68 percents of those taken from the primiparas .	
16084569-9	The correlation coefficients between the PCDDs/DFs , Co-PCBs , mono-ortho PCBs , and total dioxins and the age of the primiparas were 0.19 , 0.17 , 0.36 , and 0.24 , respectively .	
16084569-10	All these correlations were statistically significant ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
16084569-11	The positive correlations between these contaminants and the age of the secundiparas were also examined .	
16084569-12	The total dioxins as well as PCDDs/DFs , Co-PCBs , and mono-ortho PCBs in the breast milk of the primiparas declined significantly between 1998 and 2002 ( regression coefficients : -0.04 , -0.05 , -0.03 , and -0.03 , respectively ) .	
16084569-13	However , no significant decline in these levels was observed when sorted by prefectures .	
16084569-14	CONCLUSIONS Much attention should be paid to the age and parity of nursing mothers when investigating the relationship between the level of dioxins in breast milk and the body burden of infants .	
9481425-0	We studied 308 female and 92 male textile workers employed in a factory that produced synthetic fiber hosiery .	
9481425-1	The mean age of the women was 38 years , their mean duration of employment 16 years .	
9481425-2	The mean age of the men was 39 years with a mean duration of employment of 16 years .	
9481425-3	A control group of 160 female and 78 male nonexposed workers was also studied .	
9481425-4	Chronic and acute work related symptoms were recorded for all workers .	
9481425-5	Ventilatory capacity was measured by recording maximum expiratory flow-volume ( MEFV ) curves from which the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , the 1-sec forced expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) and maximum expiratory flow rates at 50% and the last 25% ( FEF50 , FEF75 ) were read .	1 11 112
9481425-6	There was a higher prevalence of all chronic respiratory symptoms in exposed than in control workers , although the differences were statistically significant only for dyspnea , sinusitis , and nasal catarrh ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) in female synthetic textile workers , and for nasal catarrh ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) in male synthetic textile workers .	
9481425-7	Occupational asthma was recorded in 3 ( 0.9% ) of the women textile workers , and in 1 ( 1.1% ) of male textile workers .	
9481425-8	There was a high prevalence of acute symptoms during the work shift , which was greatest for cough ( female : 46% ; male : 59% ) , dryness of the throat ( female : 49% ; male : 40% ) , dryness of the nose ( female : 53% ; male : 43% ) and eye irritation ( female : 46% ; male : 36% ) .	
9481425-9	Ventilatory capacity data among the synthetic textile workers demonstrated significantly decreased FEF75 compared to predicted ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
9481425-10	Our data suggest that inhalation of dust in synthetic textile plants causes the respiratory impairment .	
16139869-0	The study is a part of an ongoing prospective cohort study on the relationship between the exposure to environmental factors during pregnancy and birth outcomes and health of newborns .	
16139869-1	We have measured personal PM(2.5) level in the group of 407 non-smoking pregnant women during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy .	23 2 233
16139869-2	On average , the participants from the city center were exposed to higher exposure than those from the outer city area ( GM=42.0 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 36.8-48.0 vs. 35.8 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 33.5-38.2 microg/m(3) ) .	
16139869-3	More than 20% of study subjects were affected by high level of PM(2.5) pollution ( above 65 microg/m(3) ) .	
16139869-4	PM(2.5) concentrations were higher during the heating season ( GM=43.4 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 40.1-46.9 microg/m(3) ) compared to non-heating season ( GM=29.8 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 27.5-32.2 microg/m(3) ) .	
16139869-5	Out of all potential outdoor air pollution sources ( high traffic density , bus depot , waste incinerator , industry etc. ) considered in the bivariate analysis , only the proximity of industrial plant showed significant impact on the personal exposure ( GM=54.3 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 39.4-74.8 microg/m(3) ) compared with corresponding figure for those who did not declare living near the industrial premises ( GM=36.2 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 34.1-38.4 microg/m(3) ) .	2 233 23
16139869-6	The subjects declaring high exposure to ETS ( &gt;10 cigarettes daily ) have shown very high level of personal exposure ( GM=88.8 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 73.9-106.7 microg/m(3) ) compared with lower ETS exposure ( &lt ; or =10 cigarettes ) ( GM=46.3 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 40.0-53.5 microg/m(3) ) and no-ETS exposure group ( GM=33.9 microg/m(3) , 95% CI : 31.8-36.1 microg/m(3) ) .	
16139869-7	The contribution of the background ambient PM(10) level was very strong determinant of the total personal exposure to PM(2.5) and it explained about 31% of variance between the subjects followed by environmental tobacco smoke ( 10% ) , home heating by coal/wood stoves ( 2% ) , other types of heating ( 2% ) and the industrial plant localization in the proximity of household ( 1% ) .	2 233 23
16139870-0	Daily intakes of metals in drinking water are of extreme importance in risk assessment to human health .	
16139870-1	Some papers focused on this topic , but most of them did not consider the effect of age , gender and work location on daily intakes of metals in drinking water .	
16139870-2	The objective of present paper is to estimate the levels of Cu , Zn and As ingestion in drinking water in Shanghai , China and the effect of age , gender and work location on daily intakes of these metals .	24 2 241
16139870-3	It was also the first time that such a detailed investigation on daily intakes of metals in drinking water was carried out in China in recent years .	24 2 241
16139870-4	Drink/Sample ( D/S ) method was used to estimate the daily intakes of Cu , Zn and As in drinking water .	24 2 241
16139870-5	The mean concentrations of Cu , Zn and As in drinking water were 10.8 microg/l , 0.29 mg/l and 0.91 microg/l , which were lower than U.S. EPA's Drinking Water Equivalent Level ( DWEL ) and WHO guideline values .	
16139870-6	The average daily intakes of Cu , Zn and As in drinking water was 21.12 microg/d , 0.65 mg/d , and 1.83 microg/d , which were on average 0.01% , 1.1% and 1.5% of the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake ( PMTDI ) set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee .	24 2 241
16139870-7	There was a significant difference in daily intake of Zn for different work locations ( P=0.04 ) .	
16139870-8	But no other significant differences in daily intakes of metals in drinking water were found according to age , gender and work location .	
22177084-0	We investigate the relationship between maternal exposure to benzene and birth weight outcomes for resident births in the United States in 1996 and 1999 , taking advantage of a natural experiment afforded by the regulation of benzene content of gasoline in various American cities .	11 23 1 2 112 231
22177084-1	Regression results show that a unit increase ( Î¼g/m(3) ) in maternal exposure to benzene reduces birth weight by 16.5 g ( 95% CI , 17.6 to 15.4 ) .	11 23 1 2 112 231
22177084-2	A unit increase in benzene exposure increases the odds of a low birth weight event by 7% .	
22177084-3	Similarly , a 1 Î¼g/m(3) increase in benzene concentration increases the odds of very low birth weight event by a multiplicative factor of 1.23 ( 95% CI , 1.19 to 1.28 ) .	
22177084-4	Difference-in-differences analyses show that birth weight increased by 13.7 g ( 95% CI , 10.7 to 16.8 ) and the risk of low birth weight decreased by a factor of .95 ( 95% CI , .93 to .98 ) in counties experiencing a 25% decline in benzene concentrations from 1996 to 1999 .	
22177084-5	Public health policy and economic implications of results are discussed .	
9430265-0	We evaluated the association between chlorination byproducts and colon and rectal cancer risk in a population-based case-control study conducted in Iowa in 1986-1989 .	
9430265-1	Data were gathered from 685 colon cancer cases , 655 rectal cancer cases , and 2,434 controls .	
9430265-2	We calculated odds ratios for the 560 colon cancer cases , 537 rectal cancer cases , and 1,983 controls for whom water exposure information was available for at least 70% of their lifetime .	
9430265-3	We estimated exposure to chlorination byproducts with two types of measures : duration of lifetime at residences served by chlorinated water and estimated lifetime trihalomethane exposure .	24 2 241
9430265-4	For rectal cancer , we observed an association with duration of chlorinated surface water use , with adjusted odds ratios of 1.1 , 1.6 , 1.6 , and 2.6 for 1-19 , 20-39 , 40-59 , and &gt ; or =60 years of exposure , compared with no exposure .	24 2 241
9430265-5	Rectal cancer risk was also associated with several different measures of estimated lifetime trihalomethane exposure .	
9430265-6	For colon cancer and subsites , we detected no important increase in risk associated with duration of chlorinated surface water , nor with trihalomethane estimates .	
9430265-7	When we evaluated chlorination byproducts jointly with other factors , we found larger relative risk estimates for rectal cancer among subjects with low dietary fiber intake .	24 2 243
9430265-8	The risk related to &gt ; or =40 years of exposure to a chlorinated surface water source was 2.4 ( 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.0 ) for persons with low fiber intake and 0.9 ( 95% confidence interval = 0.4-1.8 ) for persons with high fiber intake , relative to the risk of persons with high-fiber diets and no exposure to chlorinated surface water .	24 2 241 243
9430265-9	We observed a similar risk differential for low and high levels of physical activity .	
16140361-0	Exposure to benzene and toluene from the combustion of solid biomass fuels is one of the important causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries .	
16140361-1	In this study , we assessed the exposure of cooks to benzene and toluene from biomass fuel combustion in 55 rural homes .	
16140361-2	The GC-MS was used for quantification while a personnel sampler was used for environmental monitoring .	2 233 23
16140361-3	The benzene exposure differed significantly ( p &lt ; 0.0001 ) across different types of indoor kitchen fuel combinations .	2 23
16140361-4	The geometrical mean ( GM ) of benzene exposure for cooks during cooking hours in an indoor kitchen using mixed fuel was 75.3 microg/m3 ( with partition ) and 63.206 microg/m3 ( without partition ) , while the exposure was 11.7 microg/m3 for open type .	
16140361-5	The benzene exposure was significantly higher ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) in an indoor kitchen with respect to open type using mixed fuels .	
16140361-6	Concentration of benzene ( 114.1 microg/m3 ) for cooks in an indoor kitchen with partition using dung fuel was significantly higher in comparison to non-cooks ( 5.1 microg/m3 ) for open type .	
16140361-7	Benzene exposure was not significantly different for kitchen with ventilation ( 31.2 microg/m3 ) and without ventilation ( 45.0 microg/m3 ) using wood fuel .	
16140361-8	However , this value was significantly ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) lower than in indoor kitchens with or without partition .	
16140361-9	An almost similar trend was observed for toluene but the difference was statistically non-significant .	
16140361-10	This study may be helpful in developing a regional exposure database and in the facilitation of health risk assessment due to volatile organic pollutants in our day-to-day environment .	
16160703-0	Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study ( HEALS ) , a multidisciplinary and large prospective cohort study in Araihazar , Bangladesh , was established to evaluate the effects of full-dose range arsenic ( As ) exposure on various health outcomes , including premalignant and malignant skin tumors , total mortality , pregnancy outcomes , and children's cognitive development .	
16160703-1	In this paper , we provide descriptions of the study methods including study design , study population , data collection , response rates , and exposure and outcome assessments .	
16160703-2	We also present characteristics of the study participants including the distribution of exposure and the prevalence of skin lesion at baseline recruitment .	
16160703-3	A total of 11,746 married men and women between 18 and 75 years of age participated in the study at baseline ( a response rate of 98% ) and completed a full questionnaire interview that included a food frequency questionnaire , with a response rate of 98% .	24 2 243
16160703-4	Among the 98% of the participants who completed the clinical evaluation , over 90% provided blood samples and spot urine samples .	1 122 12 127
16160703-5	Higher educational status , male gender , and presence of premalignant skin lesions were associated with an increased likelihood of providing blood and urine samples .	
16160703-6	Older participants were less likely to donate a blood sample .	1 122 12
16160703-7	About one-third of the participants consumed water from a well with As concentration in each of three groups : &gt;100 microg/l , 25-100 microg/l , and &lt;25 microg/l .	24 2 241
16160703-8	Average urinary As concentrations were 140 and 136 microg/l for males and females , respectively .	1 12 127
16160703-9	HEALS has several unique features , including a prospective study design , comprehensive assessments of both past and future changes in As exposure at the individual level , a large repository of biological samples , and a full dose range of As exposures in the study population .	
16160703-10	HEALS is a valuable resource for examining novel research questions on the health effects of As exposure .	
22169700-0	Several studies have pointed out associations between various metals and cardiovascular disease .	
22169700-1	Since cardiovascular disease prevalence is different between males and females , we investigated whether circulating levels of metals related differently to coronary risk in men and women .	
22169700-2	In the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors ( PIVUS ) study , coronary risk was assessed by the Framingham Risk Score together with circulating blood levels of 11 different trace and heavy metals in 1016 subjects aged 70 years .	1 122 12
22169700-3	Circulating levels of cadmium , copper and manganese were significantly higher in women than in men , while mercury , zinc and lead were significantly lower following adjustment for kidney function ( measured by glomerular filtration rate , GFR ) .	
22169700-4	No significant differences between women and men were seen regarding levels of aluminium , molybdenum , cobalt , chromium and nickel .	
22169700-5	When all 11 metals were entered as independent variables together with GFR in multiple models in the Framingham Risk Score as the dependent variable , cadmium was the major determinant of the Framingham Risk Score in women ( p&lt;0.0001 , followed by zinc p=0.03 ) , while copper was the major determinant of the Framingham Risk Score in men ( p&lt;0.0001 , followed by inverse relations vs. aluminium p=0.01 and nickel p=0.01 ) .	
22169700-6	There are gender differences in levels of metals and also regarding the association between metals and coronary risk , with cadmium levels being most important for women and copper levels for men in this elderly population .	
8266934-0	In eight greenhouses used for carnation culture , workers engaged in harvesting ( n = 16 ) , were monitored for dermal and respiratory exposure and urinary excretion of propoxur .	12 22 23 1 2 127 233
8266934-1	Dermal exposure of hands and forearms was estimated from dislodgable foliar residue , using a transfer factor ( a measure of transfer of pesticides from leaves to the skin ) and the total number of working hours .	2 22
8266934-2	Total estimated dermal and respiratory exposure during harvesting ranged from 0.2 to 46 mg and from 3 to 278 micrograms , respectively .	2 22 23
8266934-3	To study the relationship between external and internal exposure to propoxur , respiratory and dermal exposure levels were compared with the total amount of 2-isopropoxyphenol ( IPP ) , the major metabolite of propoxur , excreted in urine in 24 hr .	12 22 23 1 2 127
8266934-4	The Pearson correlation coefficient between dermal exposure and the total amount of excreted IPP was 0.95 .	
8266934-5	A correlation coefficient of 0.84 was found between respiratory exposure and the amount of IPP excreted .	
8266934-6	The latter association was probably caused by the covariation of respiratory and dermal exposure levels ( r = 0.85 ) .	
8266934-7	Assuming negligible oral absorption , calculations indicated that dermal exposure could account for &gt ; 80% of the amount of excreted IPP .	
8266934-8	On the basis of the amount of IPP excreted , there was no reason to suspect increased health risks for workers from exposure to propoxur during harvesting .	
24045428-0	A hybrid approach is proposed to estimate exposure to fine particulate matter ( PM(2.5) ) at a given location and time .	
24045428-1	This approach builds on satellite-based aerosol optical depth ( AOD ) , air pollution data from sparsely distributed Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) sites and local time-space Kriging , an optimal interpolation technique .	2 231 23
24045428-2	Given the daily global coverage of AOD data , we can develop daily estimate of air quality at any given location and time .	2 231 23
24045428-3	This can assure unprecedented spatial coverage , needed for air quality surveillance and management and epidemiological studies .	
24045428-4	In this paper , we developed an empirical relationship between the 2âkm AOD and PM(2.5) data from EPA sites .	
24045428-5	Extrapolating this relationship to the study domain resulted in 2.3 million predictions of PM(2.5) between 2000 and 2009 in Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA ) .	
24045428-6	We have developed local time-space Kriging to compute exposure at a given location and time using the predicted PM(2.5) .	2 231 23
24045428-7	Daily estimates of PM(2.5) were developed for Cleveland MSA between 2000 and 2009 at 2.5âkm spatial resolution ; 1.7âmillion ( â¼79.8% ) of 2.13âmillion predictions required for multiyear and geographic domain were robust .	2 231 23
24045428-8	In the epidemiological application of the hybrid approach , admissions for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD ) was examined with respect to time-space lagged PM(2.5) exposure .	
24045428-9	Our analysis suggests that the risk of AECOPD increases 2.3% with a unit increase in PM(2.5) exposure within 9 days and 0.05Â° ( â¼5âkm ) distance lags .	
24045428-10	In the aggregated analysis , the exposed groups ( who experienced exposure to PM(2.5) &gt;15.4âÎ¼g/m(3) ) were 54% more likely to be admitted for AECOPD than the reference group .	
24045428-11	The hybrid approach offers greater spatiotemporal coverage and reliable characterization of ambient concentration than conventional in situ monitoring-based approaches .	
24045428-12	Thus , this approach can potentially reduce exposure misclassification errors in the conventional air pollution epidemiology studies .	
16171797-0	Arsenic , cadmium , lead , and mercury are neurotoxins , and some studies suggest that these elements might also be teratogens .	
16171797-1	Using a case-control study design , we investigated the relation between exposure to these heavy metals and neural tube defects ( NTDs ) in offspring of Mexican-American women living in 1 of the 14 Texas counties bordering Mexico .	
16171797-2	A total of 184 case-women with NTD-affected pregnancies and 225 control-women with normal live births were interviewed about their environmental and occupational exposures during the periconceptional period .	1 122 12 127
16171797-3	Biologic samples for blood lead and urinary arsenic , cadmium , and mercury were also obtained for a subset of these women .	1 122 12 127
16171797-4	Overall , the median levels of these biomarkers for heavy metal exposure did not differ significantly ( P &gt ; 0.05 ) between case- and control-women .	1 12
16171797-5	However , among women in the highest income group , case-women were nine times more likely ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 1.4-57 ) than control-women to have a urinary mercury 5.62 microg/L .	
16171797-6	Case-women were 4.2 times more likely ( 95% CI 1.1-16 ) to report burning treated wood during the periconceptional period than control-women .	
16171797-7	Elevated odds ratios ( ORs ) were observed for maternal and paternal occupational exposures to arsenic and mercury , but the 95% CIs were consistent with unity .	
16171797-8	The 95% CIs of the ORs were also consistent with unity for higher levels of arsenic , cadmium , lead , and mercury in drinking water and among women who lived within 2 miles at the time of conception to industrial facilities with reported emissions of any of these heavy metals .	24 2 241
16171797-9	Our findings suggest that maternal exposures to arsenic , cadmium , or lead are probably not significant risk factors for NTDs in offspring .	
16171797-10	However , the elevated urinary mercury levels found in this population and exposures to the combustion of treated wood may warrant further investigation .	
24053404-0	Manganese ( Mn ) is an essential nutrient , but overexposure can be neurotoxic .	
24053404-1	Over 800â000 kg of Mn-containing fungicides are applied each year in California .	
24053404-2	Manganese levels in teeth are a promising biomarker of perinatal exposure .	1 12 125
24053404-3	Participants in our analysis included 207 children enrolled in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas ( CHAMACOS ) , a longitudinal birth cohort study in an agricultural area of California .	
24053404-4	Mn was measured in teeth using laser-ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry .	1 12 125
24053404-5	Our purpose was to determine environmental and lifestyle factors related to prenatal Mn levels in shed teeth .	
24053404-6	We found that storage of farmworkers ' shoes in the home , maternal farm work , agricultural use of Mn-containing fungicides within 3 km of the residence , residence built on Antioch Loam soil and Mn dust loading ( Î¼g/m(2) of floor area ) during pregnancy were associated with higher Mn levels in prenatal dentin ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
24053404-7	Maternal smoking during pregnancy was inversely related to Mn levels in prenatal dentin ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
24053404-8	Multivariable regression models explained 22-29% of the variability of Mn in prenatal dentin .	
24053404-9	Our results suggest that Mn measured in prenatal dentin provides retrospective and time specific levels of fetal exposure resulting from environmental and occupational sources .	
24056321-0	Pyrethroid insecticides have been applied in the production of cotton , wool and textile .	
24056321-1	In order to examine whether textile workers are exposed to pyrethroid insecticides , we recruited 50 textile workers in two textile plants in Eastern China .	
24056321-2	Their urine samples were collected for the measurement of pyrethroid metabolites : cis- and trans-isomers of 2,2-dichlorovinyl-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ( cis-Cl2CA and trans-Cl2CA ) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ( 3-PBA ) .	1 12 127
24056321-3	Our results showed that textile workers were exposed to high levels of pyrethroid insecticides. cis-Cl2CA and 3-PBA were dominant metabolites with concentrations of 0.17-261Î¼g/L , while concentrations of trans-Cl2CA were in the range of 0.26-11Î¼g/L .	1 12 127
24056321-4	Levels of three metabolites were in a descending order : cis-Cl2CA , 3-PBA , and trans-Cl2CA .	
24056321-5	Levels of the metabolites were associated with ages and job responsibilities of textile workers .	
24056321-6	Sewing workers , cutting workers , machine operators , reorganizers , and older workers were more likely in contact with pyrethroid insecticides in the textile production. trans- to cis-Cl2CA ratios might indicate that exposure of textile workers was via dermal absorption and inhalation .	
24061053-0	Detectable concentrations of the flame retardant hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD ) have been reported in human tissues worldwide , but investigations to determine fetal exposure to this brominated flame retardant are lacking .	
24061053-1	This study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of Î±- , Î²- and Î³-HBCD in human tissues ( fetal liver and placenta ) from Canada .	1 12 125 126
24061053-2	Tissue samples were collected over a thirteen year period following elective pregnancy terminations in Montreal , Quebec , Canada .	
24061053-3	Samples were extracted using homogenisation with solvent , cleaned up using adsorption chromatography and analysis was performed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry .	
24061053-4	Total HBCD concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection ( &lt;LOD ; &lt;1 ng g(-1) ) to 4500 ng g(-1) lipid in fetal livers and &lt;LOD ( &lt;1 ng g(-1) ) to 5600 ng g(-1) lipid in placental tissue .	1 12 125 126
24061053-5	No clear temporal trend was established in liver samples , nor was a significant relationship observed between fetal age and Î£HBCD concentrations .	
24061053-6	Temporal differences , however , were noted in placental tissues before and after 2005 .	
24061053-7	HBCD concentrations in liver:placental paired tissue samples did not show a correlation .	
24061053-8	HBCD was found in placental tissues from Canadian women and results indicate that HBCD was present , at measurable concentrations , in developing fetuses from as early as 6.5 weeks .	
22142368-0	Our objectives were to determine relative contributions of diet and dust exposure from multiple microenvironments to PentaBDE body burden , and to explore the role of handwipes as a measure of personal exposure to PentaBDE .	2
22142368-1	We administered a food frequency questionnaire and collected serum , dust ( office , main living area , bedroom , and vehicle ) , and handwipe samples from 31 participants. Î£PentaBDEs ( sum of BDE 28/33 , 47 , 99 , 100 , and 153 ) in handwipes collected in the office environment were weakly correlated with dust collected from offices ( r = 0.35 , p = 0.06 ) and bedrooms ( r = 0.39 , p = 0.04 ) , but not with dust from main living areas ( r = -0.05 , p = 0.77 ) or vehicles ( r = 0.17 , p = 0.47). Î£PentaBDEs in serum were correlated with dust from main living areas ( r = 0.42 , p = 0.02 ) and bedrooms ( r = 0.49 , p = 0.008 ) , but not with dust from offices ( r = 0.22 , p = 0.25 ) or vehicles ( r = 0.20 , p = 0.41 ) .	24 12 1 122 2 243 242
22142368-2	Our final regression model included variables for main living area dust and handwipes , and predicted 55% of the variation in serum Î£PentaBDE concentrations ( p = 0.0004 ) .	
22142368-3	Diet variables were not significant predictors of Î£PentaBDEs in serum .	24 2 243
22142368-4	Our research suggests that exposure to dust in the home environment may be the most important factor in predicting PentaBDE body burden in North Americans , and potential exposure pathways may involve PBDE residues on hands .	
24066101-0	BACKGROUND Elevated exposure to the essential element manganese ( Mn ) can be toxic .	
24066101-1	Manganese concentrations in ground water vary considerably , and reported associations between Mn and early-life mortality and impaired development have raised concern .	
24066101-2	We assessed the effects of drinking water Mn exposure during pregnancy upon fetal and infant survival .	24 2 241
24066101-3	METHODS In this population-based cohort study , we identified the outcomes of pregnancies registered between February 2002 and April 2003 in Matlab , Bangladesh .	
24066101-4	Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry , we measured the concentrations of Mn and other elements in the pregnant women's drinking water .	24 2 241
24066101-5	RESULTS A total of 1,875 women were included in the analysis of spontaneous abortions ( n=158 ) and 1,887 women in the perinatal mortality analysis ( n=70 ) .	1 11 112
24066101-6	Water Mn ranged from 3.0-6,550 Âµg/L ( median=217 Âµg/L ) .	
24066101-7	The adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) for spontaneous abortion was 0.65 ( 95% CI 0.43-0.99 ) in the highest water Mn tertile ( median=1,292 Âµg/L ) as compared to the lowest tertile ( median=56 Âµg/L ) .	
24066101-8	The corresponding OR for perinatal mortality was 0.69 ( 95% CI 0.28-1.71 ) , which increased to 0.78 ( 95% CI 0.29-2.08 ) after adjustment for BMI and place of delivery ( home/health facility ; n=1,648 ) .	
24066101-9	CONCLUSIONS Elevated water Mn concentrations during pregnancy appear protective for the fetus , particularly in undernourished women .	24 2 241
24066101-10	This effect may be due to the element's role in antioxidant defense .	
22137652-0	BACKGROUND Environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) is one of the most important sources for indoor air pollution and a substantial threat to human health , but data on the concentrations of the trace metals cerium ( Ce ) and lanthanum ( La ) in context with ETS exposure are scarce .	
22137652-1	Therefore the aim of our study was to quantify Ce and La concentrations in indoor air with high ETS load .	2 232 23
22137652-2	METHODS In two subsequent investigations Ce , La and cadmium ( Cd ) in 3 smokers ' ( 11 samples ) and 7 non-smokers ' ( 28 samples ) households as well as in 28 hospitality venues in Southern Germany were analysed .	
22137652-3	Active sampling of indoor air was conducted continuously for seven days in every season in the smokers ' and non-smokers ' residences , and for 4h during the main visiting hours in the hospitality venues ( restaurants , pubs , and discotheques ) .	2 232 23
22137652-4	RESULTS In terms of residences median levels of Cd were 0.1 ng/m(3) for non-smokers ' and 0.8 ng/m(3) for smokers ' households .	
22137652-5	Median concentrations of Ce were 0.4 ng/m(3) and 9.6 ng/m(3) , and median concentrations of La were 0.2 ng/m(3) and 5.9 ng/m(3) for non-smokers ' and for smokers ' households , respectively .	
22137652-6	In the different types of hospitality venues median levels ranged from 2.6 to 9.7 ng/m(3) for Cd , from 18.5 to 50.0 ng/m(3) for Ce and from 10.6 to 23.0 ng/m(3) for La with highest median levels in discotheques .	
22137652-7	CONCLUSIONS The high concentrations of Ce and La found in ETS enriched indoor air of smokers ' households and hospitality venues are an important finding as Ce and La are associated with adverse health effects and data on this issue are scarce .	
22137652-8	Further research on their toxicological , human and public health consequences is urgently required .	
22136759-0	BACKGROUND The use of biomass for cooking and heating is considered an important factor associated with respiratory diseases .	
22136759-1	However , few studies evaluate the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5 Î¼m in diameter ( PM2.5 ) , symptoms and lung function in the same population .	
22136759-2	OBJECTIVES To evaluate the respiratory effects of biomass combustion and compare the results with those of individuals from the same community in Brazil using liquefied petroleum gas ( Gas ) .	
22136759-3	METHODS 1402 individuals in 260 residences were divided into three groups according to exposure ( Gas , Indoor-Biomass , Outside-Biomass ) .	
22136759-4	Respiratory symptoms were assessed using questionnaires .	
22136759-5	Reflectance of paper filters was used to assess particulate matter exposure .	2 232 23
22136759-6	In 48 residences the amount of PM2.5 was also quantified .	2 232 23
22136759-7	Pulmonary function tests were performed in 120 individuals .	
22136759-8	RESULTS Reflectance index correlated directly with PM2.5 ( r=0.92 ) and was used to estimate exposure ( ePM2.5 ) .	
22136759-9	There was a significant increase in ePM2.5 in Indoor-Biomass and Outside-Biomass , compared to Gas .	
22136759-10	There was a significantly increased odds ratio ( OR ) for cough , wheezing and dyspnea in adults exposed to Indoor-Biomass ( OR=2.93 , 2.33 , 2.59 , respectively ) and Outside-Biomass ( OR=1.78 , 1.78 , 1.80 , respectively ) compared to Gas .	
22136759-11	Pulmonary function tests revealed both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas individuals to have decreased %predicted-forced expiratory volume in the first second ( FEV1 ) and FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC ) as compared to Non-Smoker-Gas .	1 11 112
22136759-12	Pulmonary function tests data was inversely correlated with duration and ePM2.5 .	
22136759-13	The prevalence of airway obstruction was 20% in both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas subjects .	
22136759-14	CONCLUSION Chronic exposure to biomass combustion is associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms , reduced lung function and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .	
22136759-15	These effects are associated with the duration and magnitude of exposure and are exacerbated by tobacco smoke .	
16221470-0	The influence of cadmium ( Cd ) body burden on mortality remains controversial .	
16221470-1	Excess mortality and the dose-response relationship between mortality and urinary cadmium excretion were investigated in this study among environmentally exposed subjects .	
16221470-2	A 15-year follow-up study was carried out on 3119 inhabitants ( 1403 men and 1716 women ) of the Cd-polluted Kakehashi River basin , whose urinary Cd concentration was examined in a 1981-1982 health impact survey .	1 12 127
16221470-3	The mortality risk of high urinary Cd ( &gt ; or = 10 microg/g Cr ) subjects after adjustment for age using Cox's proportional hazard model was higher than that of moderate urinary Cd ( &lt ; 10 microg/g Cr ) subjects in both sexes .	1 12 127
16221470-4	When the subjects were divided into five groups according to the amount of urinary Cd ( &lt;3 , 3-5 , 5-10 , 10-20 , &gt ; or = 20 microg/g Cr ) , the mortality risk was significantly increased among the subjects with urinary Cd &gt ; or = 3 microg/g Cr in proportion to the increases in the amount of urinary Cd concentration after adjustment for age , especially in women .	
16221470-5	Furthermore , special causes of death among high and moderate urinary Cd were investigated , and mortality risk ratio for heart failure , which is a cause of death often diagnosed in cases with a gradual deterioration culminating in death , was significantly increased in both sexes , compared with the moderate urinary Cd subjects .	
16221470-6	Also , in women the mortality risk for renal diseases in the high urinary Cd subjects was significantly higher than that in the moderate urinary Cd subjects .	
16221470-7	These results suggest that a causal association between Cd body burden and mortality exists among inhabitants environmentally exposed to Cd but that no special disease may be induced except renal diseases .	
22134029-0	Nitric oxide ( NO ) , produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) , is a potent vasodilator and plays a prominent role in regulating the cardiovascular system .	
22134029-1	Decreased basal NO release may predispose to cardiovascular diseases .	
22134029-2	Evidence suggests that the 27 nt repeat polymorphism of the intron 4 in the eNOS gene may regulate eNOS expression .	
22134029-3	On the other hand , some recent reports strongly suggest an association between methylmercury ( MeHg ) exposures and altered NO synthesis .	
22134029-4	In the present study , we investigate the contribution of the 27-pb tandem repeat polymorphism on nitric oxide production , which could enhance susceptibility to cardiovascular disease in the MeHg-exposed study population .	
22134029-5	Two-hundred-two participants ( 98 men and 104 women ) , all chronically exposed to MeHg through fish consumption were examined .	
22134029-6	Mean blood Hg concentration and nitrite plasma concentration were 50.5 Â± 35.4 Î¼g/L and 251.4 Â± 106.3n M , respectively .	1 122 12
22134029-7	Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 120.1 Â± 19.4mm Hg and 72.0 Â± 10.6mm Hg , respectively .	
22134029-8	Mean body mass index was 24.5 Â± 4.3 kg/m(2) and the mean heart rate was 69.8 Â± 11.8 bpm .	
22134029-9	There were no significant differences in age , arterial blood pressure , body mass index or cardiac frequency between genotype groups ( all P&gt;0.05 ) .	
22134029-10	However , we observed different nitrite concentrations in the genotypes groups , with lower nitrite levels for the 4a4a genotype carriers .	
22134029-11	Age , gender and the presence of intron 4 polymorphism contributed to nitrite reduction as a result of blood Hg concentration .	
22134029-12	Taken together , our results show that the 27 nt repeat polymorphism of the intron 4 in the eNOS gene increases susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases after MeHg exposure by modulating nitric oxide levels .	
8394648-0	A quantitative retrospective exposure assessment method was developed for use in a nested case-control study of lung cancer among mine and pottery workers exposed to silica dust in the People's Republic of China .	
8394648-1	Exposure assessment was carried out in 20 mines ( 10 tungsten , 6 iron/copper , and 4 tin ) and nine pottery factories .	
8394648-2	A job title dictionary was developed and used in both the collection of historical exposure information and work histories of 1,668 ( 316 cases and 1,352 controls ) study subjects .	2 21
8394648-3	Several data abstraction forms were developed to collect historical and current exposure information and employees ' work histories , starting in 1950 .	2 21
8394648-4	A retrospective exposure matrix was developed on the basis of facility/job title/calendar year combinations using available historical exposure information and current exposure profiles .	2 21
8394648-5	Information on the amount of respirable , thoracic , and free silica content in total dust was used in estimating exposure to silica .	
8394648-6	Starting in 1950 , 6,805 historical estimates had been carried out for 14 calendar-year periods .	
8394648-7	We estimated the average total dust concentration to be 9 mg/M3 , with a range from 28 mg/M3 in earlier years to 3 mg/M3 in recent years .	
8394648-8	Several exposure indices [ such as cumulative dust , average dust , cumulative respirable ( &lt ; 5 mu in particle size ) and thoracic ( &lt ; 10 mu in particle size ) silica dust , average respirable and thoracic silica dust , exposure-weighted duration , and the highest/longest exposure ] were calculated for individuals by merging work history and historical exposure matrix for each study subject .	2 21 232 23
8394648-9	We developed these various measures of exposure to allow investigators to compare and contrast different indices of historical exposure to silica .	
23757599-0	BACKGROUND Arsenic exposure is a risk factor for atherosclerosis in adults , but there is little information on arsenic and early risk biomarkers for atherosclerosis in children .	
23757599-1	Carotid intima-media thickness ( cIMT ) is an indicator of subclinical atherosclerotic burden that has been associated with plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) , a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk .	1 11 112
23757599-2	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate associations of arsenic exposure with cIMT , ADMA , and endothelial adhesion molecules [ soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) ; soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sVCAM-1) ] in children who had been exposed to environmental inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) .	11 1 11123 111 1112
23757599-3	METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study in 199 children 3-14 years of age who were residents of Zimapan , MÃ©xico .	1 12 127
23757599-4	We evaluated cIMT using ultrasonography , and plasma lipid profiles by standard methods .	
23757599-5	We analyzed ADMA , sICAM-1 , and sVCAM-1 by ELISA , and measured the concentrations of total speciated arsenic ( tAs ) in urine using hydride generation cryotrapping atomic absorption spectrometry .	1 12 127
23757599-6	RESULTS In the multiple linear regression model for cIMT , tAs categories were positively associated with cIMT increase .	
23757599-7	The estimated cIMT diameter was greater in 35- to 70-ng/mL and &gt ; 70-ng/mL groups ( 0.035 mm and 0.058 mm per 1-ng/mL increase in urinary tAs , respectively ) , compared with the &lt ; 35-ng/mL group .	1 12 127
23757599-8	In addition to tAs level , plasma ADMA was a significant predictor of cIMT .	
23757599-9	In the adjusted regression model , cIMT , percent iAs , and plasma sVCAM-1 were significant predictors of ADMA levels ( e.g. , 0.419-Î¼mol/L increase in ADMA per 1-mm increase in cIMT ) .	
23757599-10	CONCLUSIONS Arsenic exposure and plasma ADMA levels were positively associated with cIMT in a population of Mexican children with environmental arsenic exposure through drinking water .	
23853121-0	BACKGROUND Pesticides used in agriculture can be taken into worker homes and pose a potential risk for children and other family members .	
23853121-1	This study focused on identification of potential intervention points at the workplace .	
23853121-2	METHODS Workers ( N = 46 ) recruited from two tree fruit orchards in Washington State were administered a 63-item pesticide safety questionnaire .	24 2 242
23853121-3	Dust was collected from commuter vehicles and worker homes and analyzed for four organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides ( azinphosmethyl , phosmet , chlorpyrifos , malathion ) .	24 2 242
23853121-4	RESULTS Geometric mean azinphosmethyl concentrations in dust for three worker groups ( 16 pesticide handlers , 15 green fruit thinners , 15 organic orchard workers ) ranged from 0.027-1.5 Î¼g/g , with levels in vehicle dust higher than in house dust , and levels in house dust from handlers ' homes higher than levels from tree fruit thinners ' homes .	24 2 242
23853121-5	Vehicle and house dust concentrations of azinphosmethyl were highly associated ( R(2) = 0.44 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
23853121-6	Significant differences were found across worker groups for availability of laundry facilities , work boot storage , frequency of hand washing , commuter vehicle use , parking location , and safety training .	
23853121-7	CONCLUSIONS These findings support a focus on intervention activities to reduce take home pesticide exposure closer to the source of contamination ; specifically , the workplace and vehicles used to travel to the workplace .	
7601077-0	A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine whether environmental exposure of children to lead may cause renal effects .	
7601077-1	The study involved a total of 195 children aged 12 to 15 years .	
7601077-2	One hundred forty-four children ( 63 boys and 81 girls ) were recruited from two schools in the vicinity of a lead smelter and 51 ( 25 boys and 26 girls ) from a school in a rural area .	24 12 1 122 2 242
7601077-3	Compared to their referents , boys and girls from the two schools in the polluted area had significantly higher levels of lead in blood ( PbB ) but similar levels of cadmium ( CdB ) and zinc protoporphyrins ( ZPP ) .	1 122 12
7601077-4	The functional integrity of the kidney was assessed by measuring the urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin , Clara cell protein , retinol-binding protein ( RBP ) , albumin and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase .	11 1 11123 111 1112
7601077-5	The most significant and consistent finding of the study was that children from the two schools in the polluted area showed a significant elevation of the urinary excretion of RBP that paralleled the level of lead in blood or in the dust collected on the school playgrounds .	24 12 1 122 2 242
7601077-6	A similar pattern was observed for the prevalence of elevated values of urinary RBP which increased from 3.9% in the control area up to 17% in the most polluted school .	
7601077-7	Urinary RBP was found to be associated with PbB ( partial r2 = 0.046 , P = 0.005 ) in a stepwise regression analysis testing also the influence of age , sex , CdB , and ZPP .	
7601077-8	In conclusion , the present study suggests that lead contaminating the environment may cause slight effects on the proximal tubule function in children at exposure levels close to those associated with CNS deficit .	
8243397-0	Certain complications of pregnancy , e.g. , threatened spontaneous abortion , toxemia , emesis , and anemia , were studied in pregnant women living in industrial areas contaminated by smelters and the petrochemical industry .	1 122 12 127
8243397-1	Exposure to lead or aromatic hydrocarbons was assessed in parallel by the determination of these agents or their metabolites in blood and urine .	1 122 12 127
8243397-2	Comparison of respective exposure levels was made between women with normal pregnancies and those with complications .	
8243397-3	Significantly higher levels of lead in blood and increased excretion of the metabolic products of organic solvents were found in women with complicated pregnancies compared to those with normal pregnancies .	
8243397-4	Threatened spontaneous abortion , toxemia , and anemia were associated with higher lead exposure in the vicinity of smelters .	1 11 112
8243397-5	In these patients , evidence of disturbances of blood glutathione equilibrium and increased lipid peroxidation were found indicating a decreased ability to compensate for the effects of exposure .	11 1 11121 11123 111 1114 1112
8243397-6	Styrene exposure in a petrochemical industrial area was associated mainly with late toxemia and nephropathy .	
8243397-7	Patients with these complications also had a tendency to elevated exposure to other aromatic hydrocarbons .	
8243397-8	It is suggested that complications of pregnancy may be induced by environmental agents at levels lower than those that result in pregnancy loss or preterm birth .	
23764934-0	Millions of people worldwide are exposed to arsenic in drinking water .	
23764934-1	The International Agency for Research on Cancer has concluded that ingested arsenic causes lung , bladder , and skin cancer .	
23764934-2	However , a similar conclusion was not made for kidney cancer because of a lack of research with individual data on exposure and dose-response .	
23764934-3	With its unusual geology , high exposures , and good information on past arsenic water concentrations , northern Chile is one of the best places in the world to investigate the carcinogenicity of arsenic .	
23764934-4	We performed a case-control study in 2007-2010 of 122 kidney cancer cases and 640 population-based controls with individual data on exposure and potential confounders .	2
23764934-5	Cases included 76 renal cell , 24 transitional cell renal pelvis and ureter , and 22 other kidney cancers .	
23764934-6	For renal pelvis and ureter cancers , the adjusted odds ratios by average arsenic intakes of &lt;400 , 400-1,000 , and &gt;1,000 Âµg/day ( median water concentrations of 60 , 300 , and 860 Âµg/L ) were 1.00 , 5.71 ( 95% confidence interval : 1.65 , 19.82 ) , and 11.09 ( 95% confidence interval : 3.60 , 34.16 ) ( Ptrend &lt ; 0.001 ) , respectively .	24 2
23764934-7	Odds ratios were not elevated for renal cell cancer .	
23764934-8	With these new findings , including evidence of dose-response , we believe there is now sufficient evidence in humans that drinking-water arsenic causes renal pelvis and ureter cancer .	24 2 241
23769261-0	Arsenic ( As ) , a ubiquitous environmental toxicant , has recently been linked to disrupted immune function and enhanced infection susceptibility in highly exposed populations .	
23769261-1	In drinking water , as levels above the EPA maximum contaminant level occur in our US study area and are a particular health concern for pregnant women and infants .	
23769261-2	As a part of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study , we investigated whether in utero exposure to As affects risk of infant infections .	
23769261-3	We prospectively obtained information on 4-month-old infants ( n=214 ) using a parental telephone survey on infant infections and symptoms , including respiratory infections , diarrhea and specific illnesses , as well as the duration and severity of infections .	1 11 112
23769261-4	Using logistic regression and Poisson models , we evaluated the association between maternal urinary As during pregnancy and infection risks adjusted for potentially confounding factors .	1 12 127
23769261-5	Maternal urinary As concentrations were related to total number of infections requiring a physician visit ( relative risk ( RR ) per one-fold increase in As in urine=1.5 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI)=1.0 , 2.1 ) or prescription medication ( RR=1.6 ; 95% CI=1.1 , 2.4 ) , as well as lower respiratory infections treated with prescription medication ( RR=3.3 ; 95% CI=1.2 , 9.0 ) .	
23769261-6	Associations were observed with respiratory symptoms ( RR=4.0 ; 95% CI=1.0 , 15.8 ) , upper respiratory infections ( RR=1.6 ; 95% CI=1.0 , 2.5 ) , and colds treated with prescription medication ( RR=2.3 ; 95% CI=1.0 , 5.2 ) .	
23769261-7	Our results provide initial evidence that in utero As exposure may be related to infant infection and infection severity and provide insight into the early life impacts of fetal As exposure .	
23770579-0	Inuit living in the Arctic are exposed to elevated levels of environmental contaminants primarily due to long-range atmospheric transport .	
23770579-1	Blood sampling and contaminant biomonitoring was conducted as part of the International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey in 2007-2008 .	1 122 12
23770579-2	The body burden of metals ( e.g .	
23770579-3	Cd , Pb ) and persistent organic pollutants ( e.g .	
23770579-4	PCBs , DDT &amp ; DDE , toxaphene , chlordane , PBDEs ) were measured for Inuit participants ( n=2172 ) from 36 communities in Nunavut , Nunatsiavut , and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region , in Canada .	
23770579-5	The geometric mean of blood concentrations for Cd , Pb , PCBs , DDE &amp ; DDT , toxaphene , and chlordane were higher than those in the Canadian general population .	1 122 12
23770579-6	A total of 9% of study participants exceeded the intervention guideline of 100Î¼gL(-1) for Pb , 11% of participants exceeded the trigger guideline of 5Î¼gL(-1) for Cd , and 1% exceeded the intervention guideline of 100Î¼gL(-1) for PCBs .	
23770579-7	Also , 3% of women of child-bearing age exceeded blood Pb of 100Î¼gL(-1) while 28% of women of child-bearing age exceeded 5Î¼gL(-1) of PCBs .	
23770579-8	This work showed that most Inuit Health Survey participants were below blood contaminant guidelines set by Health Canada but that metal and POP body burdens commonly exceed exposures observed in the general population of Canada .	
23773573-0	BACKGROUND Environmental exposure to cadmium causes renal dysfunction and bone damage .	
23773573-1	Cadmium contamination in food is regarded as the main environmental source of non-occupational exposure .	
23773573-2	The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of dietary cadmium exposure in environmental cadmium exposure and its health risk among adults in Shanghai , China .	
23773573-3	METHODS A cross-sectional survey about food consumption was conducted in 2008 among 207 citizens aged over 40 years in Shanghai , China .	
23773573-4	The food frequency questionnaire was combined with food , tobacco and water cadmium exposure to estimate the daily environmental cadmium exposure in both point and probabilistic estimations .	24 2 241 21 243
23773573-5	Urine and blood samples of the participants were analyzed for internal exposure to total cadmium .	1 122 12 127
23773573-6	Correlation analysis was conducted between the internal cadmium exposure and environmental cadmium exposure .	
23773573-7	RESULTS According to the point estimation , average daily environmental cadmium exposure of the participants was 16.7 Î¼g/day and approached 33.8% of the provisional tolerable daily intake ( PTDI ) .	2
23773573-8	Dietary and tobacco cadmium exposure approached 25.8% and 7.9% of the PTDI , respectively .	
23773573-9	Males had higher levels of dietary cadmium exposure than females ( p?=?0.002 ) .	
23773573-10	The probabilistic model showed that 93.4% of the population did not have any health risks from dietary cadmium exposure .	
23773573-11	By sensitivity analysis , tobacco consumption , tobacco cadmium level , cadmium in vegetables and cadmium in rice accounted for 27.5% , 24.9% , 20.2% and 14.6% of the total cadmium exposure , respectively .	
23773573-12	The mean values of urinary and blood cadmium among the study population were 0.5 Î¼g/L and 1.9 Î¼g/L , respectively .	1 12 127
23773573-13	Positive correlations were observed between environmental cadmium exposure and blood cadmium ( R?=?0.52 , P&lt;0.01 ) , tobacco cadmium intake and blood cadmium excluding non-smokers ( R?=?0.26 , P?=?0.049&lt;0.05 ) , and urine cadmium and age ( R?=?0.15 , P?=?0.037 ) .	
23773573-14	CONCLUSIONS It has been suggested that there is no increased health risk among adult residents in Shanghai , China because of recent total cadmium exposure .	
23773573-15	Vegetables and rice were the main sources of dietary cadmium intake .	24 2 243
23773573-16	Tobacco cadmium exposure , which accounted for approximately 25% of the total dietary cadmium exposure , was another important source of non-occupational cadmium exposure .	2 232 23
23838280-0	BACKGROUND Previous research suggests perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes .	
23838280-1	OBJECTIVE We conducted a population-based study of PFOA and PFOS and birth outcomes from 2005 through 2010 in a Mid-Ohio Valley community exposed to high levels of PFOA through drinking-water contamination .	
23838280-2	METHODS Women provided serum for PFOA and PFOS measurement in 2005-2006 and reported reproductive histories in subsequent follow-up interviews .	1 122 12
23838280-3	Reported singleton live births among 1,330 women after 1 January 2005 were linked to birth records ( n = 1,630 ) to identify the outcomes of preterm birth ( &lt ; 37 weeks gestation ) , pregnancy-induced hypertension , low birth weight ( &lt ; 2,500 g ) , and birth weight ( grams ) among full-term infants .	1 11 112
23838280-4	RESULTS We observed little or no evidence of association between maternal serum PFOA or PFOS and preterm birth ( n = 158 ) or low birth weight ( n = 88 ) .	1 122 12
23838280-5	Serum PFOA and PFOS were both positively associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension ( n = 106 ) , with adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) per log unit increase in PFOA and PFOS of 1.27 ( 95% CI : 1.05 , 1.55 ) and 1.47 ( 95% CI : 1.06 , 2.04 ) , respectively , but associations did not increase monotonically when categorized by quintiles .	1 11 112
23838280-6	Results of subanalyses restricted to pregnancies conceived after blood collection were consistent with the main analyses .	1 122 12
23838280-7	There was suggestion of a modest negative association between PFOS and birth weight in full-term infants ( -29 g per log unit increase ; 95% CI : -66 , 7 ) , which became stronger when restricted to births conceived after the blood sample collection ( -49 g per log unit increase ; 95% CI : -90 , -8 ) .	
23838280-8	CONCLUSION Results provide some evidence of positive associations between measured serum perfluorinated compounds and pregnancy-induced hypertension and a negative association between PFOS and birth weight among full-term infants .	1 122 12
7713018-0	Measurements of intake and uptake of cadmium in relation to diet composition were carried out in 57 nonsmoking women , 20-50 years of age .	
7713018-1	A vegetarian/high-fiber diet and a mixed-diet group were constructed based on results from a food frequency questionnaire .	24 2 243
7713018-2	Duplicate diets and the corresponding feces were collected during 4 consecutive days in parallel with dietary recording of type and amount of food ingested for determination of the dietary intake of cadmium and various nutrients .	24 12 1 2 125 243
7713018-3	Blood and 24-hr urine samples were collected for determination of cadmium , hemoglobin , ferritin , and zinc .	1 122 12 127
7713018-4	There were no differences in the intake of nutrients between the mixed-diet and the high-fiber diet groups , except for a significantly higher intake of fiber ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) and cadmium ( p &lt ; 0.002 ) in the high-fiber group .	
7713018-5	Fecal cadmium corresponded to 98% in the mixed-diet group and 100% in the high-fiber diet group .	1 12 125
7713018-6	No differences in blood cadmium ( BCd ) or urinary cadmium ( UCd ) between groups could be detected .	1 122 12 127
7713018-7	There was a tendency toward higher BCd and UCd concentrations with increasing fiber intake ; however , the concentrations were not statistically significant at the 5% level , indicating an inhibitory effect of fiber on the gastrointestinal absorption of cadmium .	
7713018-8	Sixty-seven percent of the women had serum ferritin &lt ; 30 micrograms/l , indicating reduced body iron stores , which were highly associated with higher BCd ( irrespective of fiber intake ) .	
7713018-9	BCd was mainly correlated with UCd , serum ferritin , age , anf fibre intake .	
7713018-10	UCd and serum ferritin explained almost 60% of the variation in BCd.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )	
23777639-0	Although consumption of drinking water contaminated with inorganic arsenic is usually considered the primary exposure route , aggregate exposure to arsenic depends on direct consumption of water , use of water in food preparation , and the presence in arsenicals in foods .	
23777639-1	To gain insight into the effects of biological and behavioral factors on arsenic exposure , we determined arsenic concentrations in urine and toenails in a U.S. population that uses public or private water supplies containing inorganic arsenic .	1 123 12 127
23777639-2	Study participants were 904 adult residents of Churchill County , Nevada , whose home tap water supplies contained &lt;3 to about 1200 Âµg of arsenic per liter .	24 2 241
23777639-3	Biomarkers of exposure for this study were summed urinary concentrations of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites ( speciated arsenical ) , of all urinary arsenicals ( total arsenical ) , and of all toenail arsenicals ( total arsenical ) .	1 12 127
23777639-4	Increased tap water arsenic concentration and consumption were associated with significant upward trends for urinary speciated and total and toenail total arsenical concentrations .	24 2 241
23777639-5	Significant gender differences in concentrations of speciated and total arsenicals in urine and toenails reflected male-female difference in water intake .	
23777639-6	Both recent and higher habitual seafood consumption significantly increased urinary total but not speciated arsenical concentration .	24 2 243
23777639-7	In a stepwise general linear model , seafood consumption significantly predicted urinary total arsenical but not urinary speciated or toenail total arsenical concentrations .	24 2 243
23777639-8	Smoking behavior significantly predicted urinary speciated or total arsenical concentration .	
23777639-9	Gender , tap water arsenic concentration , and primary drinking water source significantly predicted urinary speciated and total concentrations and toenail total arsenical concentrations .	
23777639-10	These findings confirm the primacy of home tap water as a determinant of arsenic concentration in urine and toenails .	
23777639-11	However , biological and behavioral factors can modify exposure-response relations for these biomarkers .	
23777639-12	Refining estimates of the influence of these factors will permit better models of dose-response relations for this important environmental contaminant .	
23831542-0	We examine the balance between intake , intrinsic elimination half-lives and human body burdens measured in biomonitoring for polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in the North American population using the population-level pharmacokinetic model developed by Ritter et al .	2 21
23831542-1	( 2011 ) .	
23831542-2	Empirical data are collected from two studies that made total intake estimates for the North American population for the years 2004 and 2005 , and eight biomonitoring studies for the years 1992 to 2009 .	
23831542-3	We assume intake of PBDEs increased exponentially to a peak in 2004 , and has since exponentially declined .	
23831542-4	The model is fitted to the empirical PBDE intake and biomonitoring data on PBDE body burden using a least-square optimization method by adjusting the intake in 2004 and 2038 , and the intrinsic elimination rate constants , which can be expressed as equivalent half-lives .	
23831542-5	We fit the model in two types of scenarios using different combinations of PBDE intake estimates and biomonitoring data .	2 21
23831542-6	Our modeling results indicate that there is an inconsistency between the PBDE intake estimates and the biomonitoring data , and that the inconsistency is likely due to underestimation of population-level intake .	2 21
23831542-7	More efforts are needed to better characterize intake rates and identify potentially-unrecognized exposure pathways .	
23831542-8	Additional age-stratified biomonitoring data , and time trends of PBDE intakes would better constrain the model and provide an improved estimation of the intrinsic elimination half-lives .	
23831304-0	For the first nationwide representative survey on the environmental health of children and adolescents in Korea , we designed the Korean Environmental Health Survey in Children and Adolescents ( KorEHS-C ) as a two-phase survey and planned a sampling strategy that would represent the whole population of Korean children and adolescents , based on the school unit for the 6-19 years age group and the household unit for the 5 years or less age group .	1 122 12 127
23831304-1	A pilot study for 351 children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years in elementary , middle , and high school of two cities was performed to validate several measurement methods and tools , as well as to test their feasibility , and to elaborate the protocols used throughout the survey process .	1 122 12 127
23831304-2	Selected exposure biomarkers , i.e. , lead , mercury , cadmium in blood , and bisphenol A , metabolites of diethylhexyl phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate and cotinine in urine were analyzed .	1 12 127
23831304-3	We found that the levels of blood mercury ( Median : 1.7 ug/L ) and cadmium ( Median : 0.30 ug/L ) were much higher than those of subjects in Germany and the US , while metabolites of phthalates and bisphenol A showed similar levels and tendencies by age ; the highest levels of phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A occurred in the youngest group of children .	1 122 12
23831304-4	Specific investigations to elucidate the exposure pathways of major environmental exposure need to be conducted , and the KorEHS-C should cover as many potential environmental hazards as possible .	
23831254-0	Agricultural work is a major contributor to California's and the nation's economy and employs a large number of workers .	
23831254-1	However , agricultural work can have numerous risks , such as exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter ( PM ) and other airborne pollutants with potential adverse health effects .	
23831254-2	To determine the magnitude of occupational exposures , PM levels were assessed for 89 workers from three major crops in California ; almonds , melons and tomatoes .	
23831254-3	Personal samples were collected for PM2.5 and inhalable PM using personal sampling equipment .	2 233 23
23831254-4	Geometric mean concentrations from personal exposure for workers in almonds ( inhalable PM=4368Î¼g/m(3) , PM2.5=122Î¼g/m(3) , N=5 ) , tomatoes ( inhalable PM=1410Î¼g/m(3) , PM2.5=12Î¼g/m(3) , N=33 ) , and melons ( inhalable PM=1118Î¼g/m(3) , PM2.5=19Î¼g/m(3) , N=51 ) showed high PM exposure when working with these three crops .	23 2 233
23831254-5	Large exposure differences by crop were more common than by task ( i.e. harvesting , packing and weeding ) among the three crops studied .	
23831254-6	This is the largest study of agricultural workers engaged in hand harvesting , a significant employer of farm labor , and relatively high levels of exposure to PM were measured .	
8029709-0	Adipose tissue of inhabitants of the GdaÅsk city located at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea and of the province of Skierniewice of inland Poland have been investigated for congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) by the capillary GC-MS technique .	1 121 12
8029709-1	PCB IUPAC No. 153 was a high contributor of the congener occupying 23% of the total PCB content , and together with No. 138 of 18% and No. 180 of 13% were the most prevalent members .	
8029709-2	Samples taken from GdaÅsk citizens in 1990 contained 1.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms/g of total PCBs on a fat weight basis while the citizens from the province of Skierniewice , sampled in 1979 , contained 1.2 +/- 0.4 micrograms/g , which seemed to indicate a persistent PCB exposure in Poland .	
8029709-3	Among GdaÅsk citizens , randomly selected autopsy samples of liver cancer from dead persons contained 4.7 micrograms/g of PCBs , while in all other samples the level was between 0.75 and 1.9 micrograms/g of PCBs .	
8029709-4	TCDD TEQ of 13 detectable coplanar members of PCBs in adipose tissue of GdaÅsk , and Skierniewice inhabitants , was 210 and 190 pg/g on a lipid weight basis , respectively , including 45 and 59 pg/g of non-ortho , 142 and 110 pg/g of mono-ortho and 24 and 16 pg/g of di-ortho chlorobiphenyls .	1 121 12
8029709-5	A fingerprint of chlorobiphenyl composition in the samples examined was virtually the same for human adipose tissue taken in 1990 from the coastal city of GdaÅsk and in 1979 from the inland province of Skierniewice , in spite of geographic variations and sampling intervals .	1 121 12
23785499-0	BACKGROUND Studies relating long-term exposure to persistent organochlorine pollutants ( POPs ) with endocrine activities ( endocrine disrupting chemicals ) on circulating levels of steroid hormones have been limited to a small number of hormones and reported conflicting results .	
23785499-1	OBJECTIVE We examined the relationship between serum concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone , dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate , androstenedione , androstenediol , testosterone , free and bioavailable testosterone , dihydrotestosterone , estrone , estrone sulphate , estradiol , sex-hormone binding globulin , follicle-stimulating hormone , and luteinizing hormone as a function of level of exposure to three POPs known to interfere with hormone-regulated processes in different way : dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene ( DDE ) , polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) congener 153 , and chlordecone .	11 1 11121 11123 111 1112
23785499-2	METHODS We collected fasting , morning serum samples from 277 healthy , non obese , middle-aged men from the French West Indies .	1 122 12
23785499-3	Steroid hormones were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry , except for dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate , which was determined by immunological assay , as were the concentrations of sex-hormone binding globulin , follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone .	11 1 1112 111 11121
23785499-4	Associations were assessed by multiple linear regression analysis , controlling for confounding factors , in a backward elimination procedure , in multiple bootstrap samples .	
23785499-5	RESULTS DDE exposure was negatively associated to dihydrotestosterone level and positively associated to luteinizing hormone level .	
23785499-6	PCB 153 was positively associated to androstenedione and estrone levels .	
23785499-7	No association was found for chlordecone .	
23785499-8	CONCLUSIONS These results suggested that the endocrine response pattern , estimated by determining blood levels of steroid hormones , varies depending on the POPs studied , possibly reflecting differences in the modes of action generally attributed to these compounds .	
23785499-9	It remains to be investigated whether this response pattern is predictive of the subsequent occurrence of disease .	
8016632-0	From a population of 8918 farmers , 237 were selected whose consumption of locally produced foods was high .	
8016632-1	The subjects ' water sources , private wells , were of different degrees of acidity .	24 2 241
8016632-2	Significant associations between pH ( median 6.7 , range 4.7-8.6 ) of the drinking water and element concentrations were found .	
8016632-3	The correlation was negative for aluminium ( Al ; median 0.07 mumol/l ) , cadmium ( Cd ; 0.44 nmol/l ) , copper ( Cu ; 0.24 mumol/l ) and lead ( Pb ; 1.9 nmol/l ) , and positive for calcium ( Ca ; 0.62 mmol/l ) and magnesium ( Mg ; 0.21 mmol/l ) .	
8016632-4	Associations could not be found between the pH of , or element concentrations in , the water and concentrations of A1 ( 0.17 mumol/l ) , Mg ( 0.86 mmol/l ) and selenium ( Se ; 1.0 mumol/l ) in plasma , Cd ( 2.0 nmol/l ) , Pb ( 0.19 mumol/l ) and mercury ( Hg ; 13 nmol/l ) in blood , or A1 ( 12 mumol/mol creatinine ) and Cu ( 11 mumol/mol creatinine ) in urine .	1 122 12 127
8016632-5	The concentrations of Hg in blood and Se in plasma were related to fish consumption , Cd and Pb in blood to smoking , A1 in urine to antacid intake , Pb in blood to rifle activities and hunting , and Hg in blood to hunting .	24 12 1 122 2 243 127
8016632-6	Acid precipitation has an effect on element concentrations in drinking water , but not on the retention of those elements in the subjects investigated .	24 2 241
8381243-0	Sera of 87 industrial workers with a history of occupational exposition to various diisocyanates , toluene diisocyanate , hexamethylene diisocyanate and methylene-diphenyl diisocyanate were analyzed for antibodies to isocyanate-conjugated human serum albumin and for anti-dsDNA autoantibodies .	11 1 11123 111 1112
8381243-1	Ten workers ( approx. 11% ) were shown to have elevated anti-dsDNA autoantibody concentrations and 13 revealed antibodies to isocyanate-modified human serum albumin .	
8381243-2	The overlap of both tests being positive was calculated at about 40% .	
8381243-3	It would seem , therefore , that routine estimation of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies could provide additional useful information for the clinical diagnosis of occupational health impairment due to isocyanate exposure .	
8427025-0	Urinary arsenic ( inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites ) , uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin I and III isomers were determined in 84 smelter workers exposed to arsenic trioxide and in 22 non-exposed controls .	
8427025-1	Both ' high ' and ' low ' exposure groups were defined , based on individual's work area ( arsenic recovery plant and maintenance ) and mean urinary excretion of arsenic was compared to the control group ( 257 and 129 micrograms/g creatinine against 9.9 micrograms/g creatinine ) .	1 12 127
8427025-2	Total coproporphyrin ( I+III ) increased in each exposure group as compared to control ( 63.3 and 59 micrograms/g creatinine against 27.2 micrograms/g creatinine ) , as a consequence of a 2-fold increase in each coproporphyrin isomer .	11 1 11122 1112 111
8427025-3	The mean concentration of uroporphyrin in each exposure group was very similar to that of the non-exposed controls ( 9.5 and 8.8 micrograms/g creatinine against 10.7 micrograms/g creatinine ) .	11 1 11122 1112 111
8427025-4	These results suggest that long-term occupational exposure of humans to arsenic is associated with coproporphyrinuria and raise the question of the use of this parameter in addition to urinary arsenic for biological monitoring .	
8497864-0	Fetal toxicity of cadmium ( Cd ) is well documented in rodents .	
8497864-1	However , little information is available regarding the human fetus .	
8497864-2	To investigate the effect of low levels of Cd on the human placenta and the consequences on birthweight , we conducted a study of 102 mothers and their newborns in an obstetrical care unit .	
8497864-3	Placental and hair samples were collected at delivery to determine Cd concentrations .	1 123 12 126
8497864-4	The main finding of this study was the relationship between a decrease in birthweight and an increase of newborn hair Cd which varied in the presence of placental calcification .	11 1 123 12 112
8497864-5	In cases of parenchymal calcifications , placental Cd levels were higher ( Wilcoxon test , P &lt ; 0.05 ) and newborn hair Cd levels were lower ( Wilcoxon test , P &lt ; 0.01 ) than in the absence of calcification .	1 123 12 126
8497864-6	These relationships remained significant even after taking into account smoking habits and gestational age .	
8497864-7	In the presence of calcification , an increase in the level of Cd in newborn hair was related to a decrease in birthweight which was independent of placental Cd concentration ( rpartial = -0.49 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
8497864-8	In the absence of calcification , a decrease in birthweight was observed for the upper values of newborn hair Cd ( r = -0.44 , P &lt ; 0.05 when Cd &gt ; or = 0.3 ppm ) .	
8497864-9	The difference in birthweight between infants in the first and last quartiles of newborn hair Cd was 472 g in cases of calcifications and 122 g in the absence of calcification .	
8497864-10	Other placental parameters were not significantly related to placental Cd concentration .	
23799652-0	BACKGROUND In some previous studies , prenatal exposure to persistent organochlorines such as 1,1,-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene ( p,pÂ´-DDE ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) has been associated with higher body mass index ( BMI ) in children .	
23799652-1	OBJECTIVE Our goal was to evaluate the association of maternal serum levels of Î²-hexachlorocyclohexane ( Î²-HCH ) , p,pÂ´-DDE , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( p,pÂ´-DDT ) , dieldrin , heptachlor epoxide , HCB , trans-nonachlor , oxychlordane , and PCBs with offspring obesity during childhood .	11 1 122 12 112
23799652-2	METHODS The analysis was based on a subsample of 1,915 children followed until 7 years of age as part of the U.S. Collaborative Perinatal Project ( CPP ) .	
23799652-3	The CPP enrolled pregnant women in 1959-1965 ; exposure levels were measured in third-trimester maternal serum that was collected before these organochlorines were banned in the United States .	1 122 12
23799652-4	Childhood overweight and obesity were defined using age- and sex-specific cut points for BMI as recommended by the International Obesity Task Force .	1 11 112
23799652-5	RESULTS Adjusted results did not show clear evidence for an association between organochlorine exposure and obesity ; however , a suggestive finding emerged for dieldrin .	
23799652-6	Compared with those in the lowest quintile ( dieldrin , &lt ; 0.57 Î¼g/L ) , odds of obesity were 3.6 ( 95% CI : 1.3 , 10.5 ) for the fourth and 2.3 ( 95% CI : 0.8 , 7.1 ) for the highest quintile .	
23799652-7	Overweight and BMI were unrelated to organochlorine exposure .	
23799652-8	CONCLUSIONS In this population with relatively high levels of exposure to organochlorines , no clear associations with obesity or BMI emerged .	
8187709-0	We have measured non-ortho-substituted ( coplanar ) polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) levels as well as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin ( PCDD ) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran ( PCDF ) levels in human adipose tissue and serum collected in Atlanta , Georgia .	1 121 122 12
8187709-1	The results show that the concentrations of the coplanar PCBs can be more than an order of magnitude higher than the concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin .	
8187709-2	Our measurements in pooled serum collected in 1982 , 1988 , and 1989 show a decrease in coplanar PCB levels from 1982 to 1989 .	1 122 12
8187709-3	We found that the pattern of relative amounts of coplanar PCBs in adipose tissue varied greatly from person to person unlike the PCDD and PCDF patterns , which were more nearly the same .	1 121 12
8187709-4	Age was significantly correlated with the concentrations of 2,3,7,8-TCDD,3,3'4,4'-PCB , 3,3',4,4',5-PCB , and 3,3'4,4',5,5'-PCB in adipose tissue .	
8187709-5	We also measured levels of the mono- and di-ortho chlorine-substituted PCBs in human serum .	1 122 12
8187709-6	The levels for some of these PCB congeners were three orders of magnitude higher than the coplanar PCBs , PCDDs , and PCDFs .	
8187709-7	We used the international toxicity equivalency factors ( TEFs ) for PCDDs and PCDFs and the TEFs proposed by Safe for PCBs to calculate the 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents .	
8187709-8	Four PCBs ( 3,3',4,4',5- ; 2,3',4,4',5-;2,3,3',4,4'-;2,3,3',4,4',5- ) make a larger contribution than 2,3,7,8-TCDD , while four other PCBs ( 3,3',4,4'5,5'- ; 2,2',3,4,4',5'-;2,2',4,4',5,5'-;2,2',3,4,4',5,5'- ) make nearly the same contribution as 2,3,7,8-TCDD .	
8187709-9	The mono-ortho-chlorine-substituted 2,3',4,4',5-PCB , however , is the major contributor to the total 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents in general population samples from the United States , Sweden , and Japan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )	
8259485-0	Samples from different tissues were collected from autopsies of individuals of the general population of the Stockholm area , Sweden .	
8259485-1	The samples were analysed for total mercury content using radiochemical neutron activation analysis .	
8259485-2	Average concentrations of mercury in occipital cortex , abdominal muscle , pituitary gland and kidney cortex were , 10.6 ( 2.4-28.7 ) , 3.3 ( 0.9-5.4 ) , 25.0 ( 6.3-77 ) and 229 ( 21.1-810 ) micrograms/kg wet weight , respectively .	1 12 125
8259485-3	Possible predictor variables for mercury concentrations were tested in multiple linear regression models .	
8259485-4	An effect of a number of tooth surfaces with amalgam was seen in occipital lobe cortex , abdominal muscle and pituitary gland , but not in kidney cortex .	24 244 2
8259485-5	In occipital lobe cortex and abdominal muscle , concentrations of mercury increased with age .	
8259485-6	Explanations discussed include : that a significant fraction of the mercury retained from amalgam fillings has a very long biological half-life ; a decreasing capacity of mercury excretion with age ; or higher fish consumption in the older individuals .	
8259485-7	In kidney cortex mercury concentrations decreased with age .	
8259485-8	The reason for this remains unclear , but it might indicate a decreasing capacity of mercury excretion with age .	
8259485-9	Chronic alcohol abuse was associated with decreased concentrations of mercury in occipital cortex .	
8259493-0	The frequencies of 10 diseases in a cadmium ( and zinc ) contaminated region in The Netherlands were analysed by comparing hospital admissions with those of a non-contaminated region and with national values .	
8259493-1	No significant differences were found for diseases which are commonly associated with increased cadmium uptake such as renal insufficiency , nephrolithiasis , hypertension , cancer , immaturity of the new-born .	1 11 112
8259493-2	For the contaminated region a significantly higher frequency was only found for atherosclerosis ; this was relatively strong for men aged &gt ; 40 yrs .	
8259493-3	However , no higher death frequency for atherosclerosis was observed .	
8259493-4	The results are discussed in relation to limitations in the evaluation techniques used .	
8259493-5	The absence of major health risks in the contaminated area is obvious , but the possible influence of long term-low level cadmium uptake on atherosclerosis requires more attention .	
18684440-0	We conducted a cross-sectional study in Sweden , Italy and Poland to assess environmental and occupational exposure to mercury from chloralkali ( CA ) plants and the potential association with biomarkers of early renal dysfunction .	11 1
18684440-1	Questionnaire data and first-morning urine samples were collected from 757 eligible subjects .	1 12 127
18684440-2	Urine samples were analysed for mercury corrected for creatinine ( U-HgC ) , alpha-1-microglobulin ( A1M ) , N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) and albumin .	11 1 11123 111 1112
18684440-3	Determinants of urinary mercury excretion were examined .	1 12 127
18684440-4	Levels of kidney markers were compared in three U-HgC categories , and differences were tested taking age and other covariates into account .	11 1
18684440-5	In the general population , the median U-HgC was higher in Italian ( 1.2 microg/gC ) than in Polish ( 0.22 microg/gC ) or Swedish ( 0.21 microg/gC ) subjects , and no effect of living close to CA plants could be shown .	
18684440-6	Dental amalgam , chewing on amalgam , and fish consumption were positively associated with U-HgC .	24 244 2 243
18684440-7	In subjects from the general population , no effects on the kidney markers could be detected , while in men , including workers occupationally exposed to mercury , U-HgC was positively associated with the kidney markers , especially with NAG , but to some extent also with A1M and albumin .	1 12 127
18684440-8	Differences in urinary mercury and kidney markers in the general population between three studied countries could possibly be due to dietary factors , increased susceptibility to mercury at low selenium intake or co-exposure to other nephrotoxic metals .	
18676020-0	To evaluate the status of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) contamination in poultry and sequentially human exposure through consumption of poultry in an e-waste recycling site in South China , two kinds of free-range domestic birds , chicken and duck , were collected and their muscle and liver tissues were analyzed for 16 PBDE congeners .	
18676020-1	Chicken shows higher PBDE concentrations ( summation of 16 PBDE congeners ) in both muscle and liver tissues , ranged from 5.7 to 4381 and from 1.5 to 7897 ng/g ( lipid weight , the same hereinafter ) , respectively , compared to duck , ranged from 2.4 to 51 and from 1.9 to 134 ng/g .	
18676020-2	Different living habitat and feeding habits between the two species might be responsible for this observation .	
18676020-3	No sex-related differences in PBDE concentrations were found for the two species , while the PBDE concentrations in muscle were higher than those in liver for chicken .	
18676020-4	The PBDE concentrations in muscle of chicken in the present study were higher than the levels of PBDEs in chicken from other studies reported by far .	
18676020-5	BDE209 and nona-BDEs were the major congeners in poultry .	
18676020-6	Comparison of PBDE profiles between birds and environmental matrix implied that the biodebromination of BDE209 might occur in poultry .	
18676020-7	The intake of PBDEs through consumption of poultry ranges from 7.8 ng/day to 3582 ng/day with a medial 68 ng/day , which is comparable to the calculated values through consumption of all foodstuffs in other studies .	24 2 243
18676020-8	The present study suggested that the total dietary PBDEs intake for local residents might be considerably enhanced due to the e-waste recycling activity .	24 2 243
18657289-0	In order to characterize the different sources of exposure to arsenic ( As ) , urinary excretion of total As , the sum of inorganic As+MMA+DMA determined by the hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrophotometry technique , and the species As3 , As5 , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) and arsenobetaine were determined in 49 workers at a steel foundry , with presumed occupational exposure to As , and 50 subjects from the general population , all males .	24 12 1 2 241 243 127
18657289-1	No evidence of occupational exposure to As resulted from environmental monitoring performed in the foundry , although the analysis of minerals used as raw materials showed the presence of As , particularly in fossils and fine ores .	
18657289-2	The urinary concentrations of As3 , MMA , DMA , the sum of inorganic As+MMA+DMA and total As were not different in the two groups , while arsenobetaine appeared significantly higher in the controls than in the workers .	1 12 127
18657289-3	The different species of urinary As were all significantly correlated .	
18657289-4	Urinary excretion of As3 was associated with the consumption of mineral water and with residence in an industrial zone , while MMA , DMA , arsenobetaine , the sum of inorganic As+MMA+DMA and total As urinary excretion were associated with the consumption of crustaceans and/or shellfish 3 days or less before urine collection .	24 12 1 2 241 243 127
18657289-5	Multiple regression analysis confirmed these results .	
18657289-6	In conclusion , in populations with a high consumption of seafood , living in areas characterized by coastal/marine As pollution , only speciation of As can identify a prevalent role of environmental sources , like the consumption of seafood contaminated by As , in determining urinary As excretion , and exclude an occupational origin of the exposure .	
18682306-0	Seventeen polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs ) were quantified in adipose tissue samples of non-occupationally exposed women living in Southern Spain .	1 121 12
18682306-1	Geometric mean levels of sum of congeners and WHO(PCDD/F)-TEQ(2005) were 410 and 17.9pgg(-1) fat , respectively .	
18682306-2	Among PCDDs , octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( OCDD ) showed the highest concentration with a mean value of 265pgg(-1) fat , followed by 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD ( 49.3pgg(-1) fat ) and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD ( 45.2pgg(-1) fat ) .	
18682306-3	These three congeners were responsible for around 90% of the sum of all PCDD/F congeners in adipose tissue .	
18682306-4	The geometric mean 2,3,7,8-TCDD value was 1.87pgg(-1) fat. 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF ( 8.43pgg(-1) fat ) showed the highest concentration among the PCDFs , followed by 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF ( 4.17pgg(-1) fat ) and 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF ( 3.28pgg(-1) fat ) , and these three congeners were responsible for 4% of the sum of all studied PCDD/F congeners in adipose tissue and 76% of the sum of ten PCDFs. 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF was the only congener not quantified in any sample , while 1,2,3,4,7,8,9-HpCDF , 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF , OCDF and 2,3,7,8-TCDF were found in 5 , 16 , 16 and 19 samples , respectively .	
18682306-5	All other congeners were quantifiable in all 20 samples .	
18682306-6	Congeners contributing most to the WHO(PCDD/F)-TEQ(2005) were 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD ( 31.6% ) , 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD ( 28.3% ) and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF ( 14.6% ) .	
18682306-7	The body burden of log-transformed WHO(PCDD/F)-TEQ(2005) levels increased with age ( B=0.02 ; 95% CI=0.01 , 0.03 ; p=0.02 ) .	
18682306-8	Although these adipose tissue PCDD/F levels are similar to previously published findings in Spain and other European countries , further research is needed to determine trends in the exposure of women to these chemical residues .	
18709138-0	BACKGROUND One problem of interpreting population-based biomonitoring data is the reconstruction of corresponding external exposure in cases where no such data are available .	
18709138-1	OBJECTIVES We demonstrate the use of a computational framework that integrates physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) modeling , Bayesian inference , and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to obtain a population estimate of environmental chloroform source concentrations consistent with human biomonitoring data .	2 21
18709138-2	The biomonitoring data consist of chloroform blood concentrations measured as part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) , and for which no corresponding exposure data were collected .	1 122 12
18709138-3	METHODS We used a combined PBPK and shower exposure model to consider several routes and sources of exposure : ingestion of tap water , inhalation of ambient household air , and inhalation and dermal absorption while showering .	24 22 23 2 241 232
18709138-4	We determined posterior distributions for chloroform concentration in tap water and ambient household air using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Total Exposure Assessment Methodology ( TEAM ) data as prior distributions for the Bayesian analysis .	24 2 241
18709138-5	RESULTS Posterior distributions for exposure indicate that 95% of the population represented by the NHANES III data had likely chloroform exposures &lt ; or = 67 microg/L [ corrected ] in tap water and &lt ; or = 0.02 microg/L in ambient household air .	
18709138-6	CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the application of computer simulation to aid in the interpretation of human biomonitoring data in the context of the exposure-health evaluation-risk assessment continuum .	
18709138-7	These results should be considered as a demonstration of the method and can be improved with the addition of more detailed data .	
18665197-0	In the United States , about 25% of infant formula sold is based on soy protein , which is an important source of estrogenic isoflavones in the human food supply .	
18665197-1	Nevertheless , few studies report isoflavone levels in infants .	
18665197-2	We did a partly cross-sectional and partly longitudinal pilot study to examine children's exposure to isoflavones from different feeding methods .	24 2 243
18665197-3	A total of 166 full-term infants between birth and 1 year of age were recruited into soy formula , cow milk formula , or breast milk regimens according to their feeding histories .	24 2 243
18665197-4	A total of 381 urine , 361 saliva , and 88 blood samples were collected at 382 visits .	1 122 12 125 127
18665197-5	We used automated online solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC-MS/MS ) for measuring three isoflavones ( daidzein , genistein , and equol ) in urine , and used similar LC/MS/MS techniques for saliva and blood spots .	1 122 12 125 127
18665197-6	Concentrations of daidzein and genistein were undetectable in most blood or saliva samples from children fed breast milk or cow milk formula .	24 12 1 122 2 125 243
18665197-7	The proportion of non-detectable values was somewhat lower in urine than in the other matrices .	
18665197-8	Concentrations of equol were detectable only in a few urine samples .	1 12 127
18665197-9	For both daidzein and genistein , urine contained the highest median concentrations , followed by blood and then saliva .	
18665197-10	Urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein were about 500 times higher in the soy formula-fed infants than in the cow milk formula-fed infants .	24 12 1 2 243 127
18665197-11	The correlations between matrices for either analyte were strikingly lower than the correlation between the two analytes in any single matrix .	
18665197-12	We did not find significant correlations between isoflavone concentrations and the levels of certain hormones in children fed soy formula .	1 11 111
18665197-13	Our results , based on much larger numbers of infants , strongly confirm previous reports , but whether phytoestrogens in soy formula are biologically active in infants is still an open question .	
18665197-14	We plan further longitudinal studies focusing on physical and developmental findings reflecting the effects of estrogen exposure .	
18629322-0	BACKGROUND Chronic arsenic exposure causes a wide range of health effects , but little is known about critical windows of exposure .	
18629322-1	Arsenic readily crosses the placenta , but the few available data on postnatal exposure to arsenic via breast milk are not conclusive .	
18629322-2	AIM Our goal was to assess the arsenic exposure through breast milk in Bangladeshi infants , living in an area with high prevalence of arsenic-rich tube-well water .	1 12 124
18629322-3	METHODS We analyzed metabolites of inorganic arsenic in breast milk and infant urine at 3 months of age and compared them with detailed information on breast-feeding practices and maternal arsenic exposure , as measured by concentrations in blood , urine , and saliva .	12 1 122 124 125 127
18629322-4	RESULTS Arsenic concentrations in breast-milk samples were low ( median , 1 microg/kg ; range , 0.25-19 microg/kg ) , despite high arsenic exposures via drinking water ( 10-1,100 microg/L in urine and 2-40 microg/L in red blood cells ) .	1 12 124
18629322-5	Accordingly , the arsenic concentrations in urine of infants whose mothers reported exclusive breast-feeding were low ( median , 1.1 microg/L ; range , 0.3-29 microg/L ) , whereas concentrations for those whose mothers reported partial breast-feeding ranged from 0.4 to 1,520 microg/L ( median 1.9 microg/L ) .	
18629322-6	The major part of arsenic in milk was inorganic .	
18629322-7	Still , the infants had a high fraction ( median , 87% ) of the dimethylated arsenic metabolite in urine .	
18629322-8	Arsenic in breast milk was associated with arsenic in maternal blood , urine , and saliva .	1 122 12 125 127
18629322-9	CONCLUSION Very little arsenic is excreted in breast milk , even in women with high exposure from drinking water .	
18629322-10	Thus , exclusive breast-feeding protects the infant from exposure to arsenic .	
18653237-0	Hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) was measured in adipose tissue intraoperatively collected from 387 subjects over 16 years old undergoing surgery in two hospitals in Granada ( Southern Spain ) .	1 121 12
18653237-1	HCB was quantified in 90.7% of subjects .	
18653237-2	The concentrations and frequencies of HCB were similar to those reported in adipose tissue samples in other recent European studies .	
18653237-3	Exposure patterns differed between females and males : higher HCB concentrations were found in females than in males ( geometric mean 18.3 vs. 6.8 ng/g , p&lt;0.001 ) .	
18653237-4	The relationship between HCB concentrations and exposure risk factors was assessed by multivariate analysis stratifying by gender .	
18653237-5	In men , HCB concentrations were predicted ( r(2)=0.45 ) by age , body mass index ( BMI ) , place of residence , smoking , consumption of fish , chicken and cheese , occupation related to agriculture , and family involvement in construction activities .	24 2 243
18653237-6	In women , HCB concentrations were predicted ( r(2)=0.50 ) by age , BMI , consumption of milk and cheese , and occupation related to industry .	24 2 243
18653237-7	The finding that women had three-fold higher levels of HCB than the men deserves further investigation .	
18629313-0	BACKGROUND Biomass fuel is the primary source of domestic fuel in much of rural China .	
18629313-1	Previous studies have not characterized particle exposure through time-activity diaries or personal monitoring in mainland China .	
18629313-2	OBJECTIVES In this study we characterized indoor and personal particle exposure in six households in northeastern China ( three urban , three rural ) and explored differences by location , cooking status , activity , and fuel type .	2 233 232 23
18629313-3	Rural homes used biomass .	
18629313-4	Urban homes used a combination of electricity and natural gas .	
18629313-5	METHODS Stationary monitors measured hourly indoor particulate matter ( PM ) with an aerodynamic diameter &lt ; or = 10 microm ( PM10 ) for rural and urban kitchens , urban sitting rooms , and outdoors .	2 232 23
18629313-6	Personal monitors for PM with an aerodynamic diameter &lt ; or = 2.5 microm ( PM2.5 ) were employed for 10 participants .	2 233 23
18629313-7	Time-activity patterns in 30-min intervals were recorded by researchers for each participant .	
18629313-8	RESULTS Stationary monitoring results indicate that rural kitchen PM10 levels are three times higher than those in urban kitchens during cooking .	
18629313-9	PM10 was 6.1 times higher during cooking periods than during noncooking periods for rural kitchens .	
18629313-10	Personal PM2.5 levels for rural cooks were 2.8-3.6 times higher than for all other participant categories .	
18629313-11	The highest PM2.5 exposures occurred during cooking periods for urban and rural cooks .	
18629313-12	However , rural cooks had 5.4 times higher PM2.5 levels during cooking than did urban cooks .	
18629313-13	Rural cooks spent 2.5 times more hours per day cooking than did their urban counterparts .	
18629313-14	CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that biomass burning for cooking contributes substantially to indoor particulate levels and that this exposure is particularly elevated for cooks .	2 232 23
18629313-15	Second-by-second personal PM2.5 exposures revealed differences in exposures by population group and strong temporal heterogeneity that would be obscured by aggregate metrics .	
18629310-0	BACKGROUND Despite experimental evidence , most epidemiologic studies to date have not supported an association between exposure to persistent organic pollutants ( POP ) and breast cancer incidence in humans .	
18629310-1	This may be attributable to difficulties in estimating blood/tissue POP concentration at critical time periods of carcinogenesis .	
18629310-2	OBJECTIVES In this work we aimed to develop a tool to estimate lifetime POP blood/tissue exposure and levels during any hypothesized time window of susceptibility in breast cancer development .	
18629310-3	METHODS We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) model that can account for any given physiologic lifetime history .	2 21
18629310-4	Using data on pregnancies , height , weight , and age , the model estimates the values of physiologic parameters ( e.g. , organ volume , composition , and blood flow ) throughout a woman's entire life .	
18629310-5	We assessed the lifetime toxicokinetic profile ( LTP ) for various exposure scenarios and physiologic factors ( i.e. , breast-feeding , growth , pregnancy , lactation , and weight changes ) .	
18629310-6	RESULTS Simulations for three POPs [ hexachlorobenzene , polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB)-153 , PCB-180 ] using different lifetime physiologic profiles showed that the same blood concentration at 55 years of age can be reached despite totally different LTP .	
18629310-7	Aside from exposure levels , lactation periods and weight profile history were shown to be the factors that had the greatest impact on the LTP .	
18629310-8	CONCLUSIONS This new lifetime PBPK model , which showed the limitations of using a single sample value obtained around the time of diagnosis for lifetime exposure assessment , will enable researchers conducting environmental epidemiology studies to reduce uncertainty linked to past POP exposure estimation and to consider exposure during time windows that are hypothesized to be mechanistically critical in carcinogenesis .	2 21
18633327-0	BACKGROUND People with less education in Europe , Asia , and the United States are at higher risk of mortality associated with daily and longer-term air pollution exposure .	
18633327-1	We examined whether educational level modified associations between mortality and ambient particulate pollution ( PM10 ) in Latin America , using several timescales .	2 23
18633327-2	METHODS The study population included people who died during 1998-2002 in Mexico City , Mexico ; Santiago , Chile ; and SÃ£o Paulo , Brazil .	
18633327-3	We fit city-specific robust Poisson regressions to daily deaths for nonexternal-cause mortality , and then stratified by age , sex , and educational attainment among adults older than age 21 years ( none , some primary , some secondary , and high school degree or more ) .	
18633327-4	Predictor variables included a natural spline for temporal trend , linear PM10 and apparent temperature at matching lags , and day-of-week indicators .	
18633327-5	We evaluated PM10 for lags 0 and 1 day , and fit an unconstrained distributed lag model for cumulative 6-day effects .	2 231 23
18633327-6	RESULTS The effects of a 10-microg/m increment in lag 1 PM10 on all nonexternal-cause adult mortality were for Mexico City 0.39% ( 95% confidence interval = 0.13%-0.65% ) ; SÃ£o Paulo 1.04% ( 0.71%-1.38% ) ; and for Santiago 0.61% ( 0.40%-0.83% ) .	2 231 23
18633327-7	We found cumulative 6-day effects for adult mortality in Santiago ( 0.86% [ 0.48%-1.23%] ) and SÃ£o Paulo ( 1.38% [ 0.85%-1.91%] ) , but no consistent gradients by educational status .	
18633327-8	CONCLUSIONS PM10 had important short- and intermediate-term effects on mortality in these Latin American cities , but associations did not differ consistently by educational level .	
18795163-0	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although the deleterious effects of air pollution from fossil fuel combustion have been demonstrated in many Western nations , fewer studies have been conducted in Asia .	
18795163-1	The Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia ( PAPA ) project assessed the effects of short-term exposure to air pollution on daily mortality in Bangkok , Thailand , and in three cities in China : Hong Kong , Shanghai , and Wuhan .	2 231 23
18795163-2	METHODS Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions were used to adjust for seasonality and other time-varying covariates that might confound the association between air pollution and mortality .	
18795163-3	Effect estimates were determined for each city and then for the cities combined using a random effects method .	
18795163-4	RESULTS In individual cities , associations were detected between most of the pollutants [ nitrogen dioxide , sulfur dioxide , particulate matter &lt ; or = 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter ( PM(10) ) , and ozone ] and most health outcomes under study ( i.e. , all natural-cause , cardiovascular , and respiratory mortality ) .	2 231 23
18795163-5	The city-combined effects of the four pollutants tended to be equal or greater than those identified in studies conducted in Western industrial nations .	
18795163-6	In addition , residents of Asian cities are likely to have higher exposures to air pollution than those in Western industrial nations because they spend more time outdoors and less time in air conditioning .	2 23
18795163-7	CONCLUSIONS Although the social and environmental conditions may be quite different , it is reasonable to apply estimates derived from previous health effect of air pollution studies in the West to Asia .	
18795172-0	BACKGROUND Despite extensive evidence that air pollution affects childhood asthma , state-level and national-level tracking of asthma outcomes in relation to air pollution is limited .	
18795172-1	OBJECTIVES Our goals were to evaluate the feasibility of linking the 2001 California Health Interview Survey ( CHIS ) , air monitoring , and traffic data ; estimate associations between traffic density ( TD ) or outdoor air pollutant concentrations and childhood asthma morbidity ; and evaluate the usefulness of such databases , linkages , and analyses to Environmental Public Health Tracking ( EPHT ) .	2 231 23
18795172-2	METHODS We estimated TD within 500 feet of residential cross-streets of respondents and annual average pollutant concentrations based on monitoring station measurements .	2 231 23
18795172-3	We used logistic regression to examine associations with reported asthma symptoms and emergency department ( ED ) visits/hospitalizations .	
18795172-4	RESULTS Assignment of TD and air pollution exposures for cross-streets was successful for 82% of children with asthma in Los Angeles and San Diego , California , Counties .	
18795172-5	Children with asthma living in high ozone areas and areas with high concentrations of particulate matter &lt ; 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter experienced symptoms more frequently , and those living close to heavy traffic reported more ED visits/hospitalizations .	
18795172-6	The advantages of the CHIS for asthma EPHT include a large and representative sample , biennial data collection , and ascertainment of important socio-demographic and residential address information .	
18795172-7	Disadvantages are its cross-sectional design , reliance on parental reports of diagnoses and symptoms , and lack of information on some potential confounders .	
18795172-8	CONCLUSIONS Despite limitations , the CHIS provides a useful framework for examining air pollution and childhood asthma morbidity in support of EPHT , especially because later surveys address some noted gaps .	
18795172-9	We plan to employ CHIS 2003 and 2005 data and novel exposure assessment methods to re-examine the questions raised here .	
18629323-0	BACKGROUND Previous research has documented effects of both physical and social environmental exposures on childhood asthma .	
18629323-1	However , few studies have considered how these two environments might interact to affect asthma .	
18629323-2	OBJECTIVE This study aimed to test interactions between chronic exposure to traffic-related air pollution and chronic family stress in predicting biologic and clinical outcomes in children with asthma .	2 231 23
18629323-3	METHOD Children with asthma ( n = 73 , 9-18 years of age ) were interviewed about life stress , and asthma-relevant inflammatory markers [ cytokine production , immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) , eosinophil counts ] were measured .	11 1 1113 11123 111 1112
18629323-4	Parents reported on children's symptoms .	
18629323-5	Children completed daily diaries of symptoms and peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) measures at baseline and 6 months later .	1 11 112
18629323-6	Exposure to traffic-related air pollution was assessed using a land use regression model for nitrogen dioxide concentrations .	2 231 23
18629323-7	RESULTS NO(2) by stress interactions were found for interleukin-5 ( beta for interaction term = -0.31 , p = 0.02 ) , IgE ( interaction beta = -0.29 , p = 0.02 ) , and eosinophil counts ( interaction beta = -0.24 , p = 0.04 ) .	11 1 11123 111 1112
18629323-8	These interactions showed that higher chronic stress was associated with heightened inflammatory profiles as pollution levels decreased .	
18629323-9	Longitudinally , NO(2) by stress interactions emerged for daily diary symptoms ( interaction beta = -0.28 , p = 0.02 ) , parent-reported symptoms ( interaction beta = -0.25 , p = 0.07 ) , and PEFR ( interaction beta = 0.30 , p = 0.03 ) .	
18629323-10	These interactions indicated that higher chronic stress was associated with increases over time in symptoms and decreases over time in PEFR as pollution levels decreased .	
18629323-11	CONCLUSIONS The physical and social environments interacted in predicting both biologic and clinical outcomes in children with asthma , suggesting that when pollution exposure is more modest , vulnerability to asthma exacerbations may be heightened in children with higher chronic stress .	
18718897-0	In a selected group of women from the Danish National Birth Cohort , the authors investigated the association between intake of fatty fish and plasma concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) on the one hand and the association between maternal PCB concentrations and fetal growth on the other .	11 24 12 1 122 2 243 112
18718897-1	Of 70,183 women who filled in a food frequency questionnaire during 1996-2002 , 100 nulliparous women aged 25-35 years with normal prepregnancy body mass index were selected according to their intake of fatty fish ( low ( 0 meals/month , n = 34 ) , medium ( 1-3 meals/month , n = 33 ) , or high ( &gt ; or = meals/month , n = 33) ) .	24 2 243
18718897-2	Women with a high intake of fatty fish had 50% ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 31 , 72 ) higher plasma PCB concentrations than women with low intake .	
18718897-3	Maternal plasma PCB concentrations were inversely associated with birth weight and placental weight .	11 1 122 12 112
18718897-4	The adjusted mean difference between the 75th and 25th PCB percentiles was -155 g ( 95% CI : -291 , -19 ) for birth weight and -81 g ( 95% CI : -135 , -26 ) for placental weight .	
18718897-5	These results support previous findings from this cohort , where fatty fish intake was inversely associated with fetal growth .	
18718897-6	Dietary recommendations often encourage weekly consumption of fatty fish .	
18718897-7	These results suggest that potential exposure to PCBs should be carefully considered before recommending such intakes among women of childbearing age .	
18602865-0	A health risk assessment was conducted for exposure to trace metals via drinking water ingestion pathway for Province of Izmir , Turkey .	24 2 241
18602865-1	Concentrations of 11 trace metals were measured in drinking waters collected from 100 population weighted random sampling units ( houses ) .	
18602865-2	The samples were analyzed in atomic absorption spectrometry for arsenic , and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry for Be , Cd , Co , Cr , Cu , Mn , Ni , Pb , V , and Zn .	
18602865-3	Questionnaires were administered to a participant from each sampling unit to determine drinking water consumption related information and demographics .	24 2 241
18602865-4	Exposure and risks were estimated for each individual by direct calculation , and for Izmir population by Monte Carlo simulation .	24 2 241
18602865-5	Six trace metals ( As , Cr , Cu , Mn , Ni , and Zn ) were detected in &gt;50% of the samples .	
18602865-6	Concentrations of As and Ni exceeded the corresponding standards in 20% and 58% of the samples , respectively .	
18602865-7	As a result , arsenic noncarcinogenic risks were higher than the level of concern for 19% of the population , whereas carcinogenic risks were &gt;10(-4) for 46% , and &gt;10(-6) for 90% of the population .	
18760967-0	We evaluated exposure to pesticides among secondary school students aged 12-13 years old in Chiang Mai Province , Thailand .	1 12 127
18760967-1	Pesticide-specific urinary metabolites were used as biomarkers of exposure for a variety of pesticides , including organophosphorus insecticides , synthetic pyrethroid insecticides and selected herbicides .	1 12 127
18760967-2	We employed a simple solid-phase extraction with analysis using isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC-MS/MS ) .	
18760967-3	A total of 207 urine samples from Thai students were analyzed for 18 specific pesticide metabolites .	1 12 127
18760967-4	We found 14 metabolites in the urine samples tested ; seven of them were detected with a frequency &gt ; or=17% .	
18760967-5	The most frequently detected metabolites were 2-[(dimethoxyphosphorothioyl) sulfanyl ] succinic acid ( malathion dicarboxylic acid ) , para-nitrophenol ( PNP ) , 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol ( TPCY ; metabolite of chlorpyrifos ) , 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2,4-D ) , cis- and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acids ( c-DCCA and t-DCCA ; metabolite of permethrin ) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ( 3-PBA ; metabolite of pyrethroids ) .	
18760967-6	The students were classified into 4 groups according to their parental occupations : farmers ( N=60 ) , merchants and traders ( N=39 ) , government and company employees ( N=52 ) , and laborers ( N=56 ) .	
18760967-7	Children of farmers had significantly higher urinary concentrations of pyrethroid insecticide metabolites than did other children ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	1 12 127
18760967-8	Similarly , children of agricultural families had significantly higher pyrethroid metabolite concentrations .	
18760967-9	Males had significantly higher values of PNP ( Mann-Whitney test , p=0.009 ) ; however , no other sex-related differences were observed .	
18760967-10	Because parental occupation and agricultural activities seemed to have little influence on pesticide levels , dietary sources were the likely contributors to the metabolite levels observed .	
18835862-0	Adverse health effects of exposures to acute air pollution have been well studied .	
18835862-1	Fewer studies have examined effects of chronic exposure .	
18835862-2	Previous studies used exposure estimates for narrow time periods and were limited by the geographic distribution of pollution monitors .	
18835862-3	This study examined the association of chronic particulate exposures with all-cause mortality , incident nonfatal myocardial infarction , and fatal coronary heart disease ( CHD ) in a prospective cohort of 66,250 women from the Nurses ' Health Study in northeastern US metropolitan areas .	2 23
18835862-4	Nonfatal outcomes were assessed through self-report and medical record review and fatalities through death certificates and medical record review .	
18835862-5	During follow-up ( 1992-2002 ) , 3,785 deaths and 1,348 incident fatal CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred .	
18835862-6	In age- and calendar-time-adjusted models , 10-microg/m(3) increases in 12-month average exposures to particulate matter &lt;10 microm in diameter were associated with increased all-cause mortality ( 16% , 95% confidence interval : 5 , 28 ) and fatal CHD ( 43% , 95% confidence interval : 10 , 86 ) .	2 231 23
18835862-7	Adjustment for body mass index and physical activity weakened these associations .	
18835862-8	Body mass index and smoking modified the association between exposure to particulate matter &lt;10 microm in diameter and fatal CHD .	
18835862-9	In this population , increases in such exposures were associated with increases in all-cause and CHD mortality .	
18835862-10	Never smokers with higher body mass indexes were at greatest risk of fatal CHD .	
18625514-0	The Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study ( CCAAPS ) is a prospective birth cohort whose purpose is to determine if exposure to high levels of diesel exhaust particles ( DEP ) during early childhood increases the risk for developing allergic diseases .	
18625514-1	In order to estimate exposure to DEP , a land-use regression ( LUR ) model was developed using geographic data as independent variables and sampled levels of a marker of DEP as the dependent variable .	2 231 23
18625514-2	A continuous wind direction variable was also created .	
18625514-3	The LUR model predicted 74% of the variability in sampled values with four variables : wind direction , length of bus routes within 300 m of the sample site , a measure of truck intensity within 300 m of the sampling site , and elevation .	
18625514-4	The LUR model was subsequently applied to all locations where the child had spent more than eight hours per week from through age three .	2 231 23
18625514-5	A time-weighted average ( TWA ) microenvironmental exposure estimate was derived for four time periods : 0-6 months , 7-12 months , 13-24 months , 25-36 months .	
18625514-6	By age two , one third of the children were spending significant time at locations other than home and by 36 months , 39% of the children had changed their residential addresses .	
18625514-7	The mean cumulative DEP exposure estimate increased from age 6 to 36 months from 70 to 414 microg/m3-days .	
18625514-8	Findings indicate that using birth addresses to estimate a child's exposure may result in exposure misclassification for some children who spend a significant amount of time at a location with high exposure to DEP .	2 231 23
18599107-0	As part of a longitudinal cohort study , now in its second decade , we determined PCDDs/Fs dl-PCBs and PBDEs in serum of adolescents with known perinatal PCDD/F exposure .	1 122 12
18599107-1	Of the original cohort , 33 adolescents aged 14-19 years , who had been studied previously during their neonatal ( n=60 ) , toddler and pre-pubertal period ( n=41 ) agreed to participate in the current follow-up .	
18599107-2	PCDD/F- , dl-PCB- and PBDE congeners were measured using GC/MS .	
18599107-3	Current serum levels of PCDD/Fs determined in our cohort were relatively low ( mean of 2.2 pg/g ) compared to the perinatal exposure .	1 122 12
18599107-4	No correlation between perinatal exposure and current serum PCDD/F was found .	
18599107-5	Planar PCB TEQ levels were 2.2 pg/g .	
18599107-6	Current summation operatorPBDE levels were 8.7 ng/g lipid .	
18599107-7	There was one outlier with a summation operatorPBDE of 74 ng/g lipid .	
18599107-8	The presence of this high value indicates that the exposure pathway is different from PCDD/F and PCB , most likely by dust and food contaminated with dust .	
18599107-9	Concluding we can say that current PCDD/F levels are quite low compared to the perinatal PCDD/F exposure of the cohort .	
18599107-10	PBDE levels however are relatively high compared to other European countries , more research on possible health effects of these levels , especially for subjects with outlier concentrations , should be performed .	
18786695-0	Commercial aircrafts need a high degree of fire protection for passenger safety .	
18786695-1	Brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) , including polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , may be used for this purpose .	
18786695-2	Because PBDEs readily absorb to dust particles , aircraft crew and passengers may receive significant PBDEs exposure via inhalation .	
18786695-3	The aims of this work were to assess whether PBDEs could be found in aircraft cabin dust and whether serum levels of PBDEs increased in passengers after long-distance flights .	1 122 12
18786695-4	Hence nine subjects on intercontinental flights collected cabin dust samples , as well as donated blood samples before departure and after return to Sweden .	24 12 1 122 2 242
18786695-5	Two subjects who were domestic frequent flyers were also investigated .	
18786695-6	The levels of PBDEs in dust and serum were determined by GC/MS in electron capture negative ionization ( ECNI ) mode .	24 12 1 122 2 242
18786695-7	Authentic reference substances were used for identification and quantitation .	
18786695-8	PBDEs were found in all aircraft dust samples at high concentrations , higher than in common household dust .	
18786695-9	Congener patterns indicated that the technical products PentaBDE , OctaBDE and DecaBDE were used in the aircrafts .	
18786695-10	Serum concentrations in the travellers were similar to those observed in Swedish residents in general .	1 122 12
18786695-11	Post-travel serum levels of BDE-28 , BDE-99 , BDE-100 , BDE-153 , and BDE-154 were significantly higher ( p&lt;0.05 ) than concentrations prior to travel .	
18786695-12	The findings from this pilot study call for investigations of occupational exposures to PBDEs in cabin and cockpit crews .	
18941587-0	BACKGROUND Air pollution influences the development of oral clefts in animals .	
18941587-1	There are few epidemiologic data on the relation of prenatal air pollution exposure and the risk of oral clefts .	
18941587-2	OBJECTIVES Our goal in this study was to assess the relations between exposure to ambient air pollution and the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate ( CL/P ) .	11 1 2 112 23
18941587-3	METHODS We conducted a population-based case-control study of all 653 cases of CL/P and a random sample of 6,530 control subjects from 721,289 Taiwanese newborns in 2001-2003 .	
18941587-4	We used geographic information systems to form exposure parameters for sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , ozone , carbon monoxide , and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;or= 10 microm ( PM10 ) during the first 3 months of pregnancy using inverse distance weighting method .	2 231 23
18941587-5	We present the effect estimates as odds ratios ( ORs ) per 10-ppb change for SO2 , NO(x) , and O3 , 100-ppb change for CO , and 10-microg/m3 change for PM10 .	
18941587-6	RESULTS The risk of CL/P was increased in relation to O3 levels in the first gestational month [ adjusted OR = 1.20 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.02-1.39 ] and second gestational month ( adjusted OR = 1.25 ; 95% CI , 1.03-1.52 ) in the range from 16.7 ppb to 45.1 ppb , but was not related to CO , NO(x) , SO2 , or PM10 .	
18941587-7	CONCLUSIONS The study provides new evidence that exposure to outdoor air O3 during the first and second month of pregnancy may increase the risk of CL/P .	2 231 23
18941587-8	Similar levels of O3 are encountered globally by large numbers of pregnant women .	
18560540-0	BACKGROUND Although animal experiments have shown that cadmium exposure results in severe dental caries , limited epidemiologic data are available on this issue .	
18560540-1	OBJECTIVES We aimed to examine the relationship between environmental cadmium exposure and dental caries in children 6-12 years of age .	11 1 12 112 127
18560540-2	METHODS We analyzed cross-sectional data , including urine cadmium concentrations and counts of decayed or filled tooth surfaces , from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .	1 12 127
18560540-3	We used logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial ( ZINB ) regression to estimate the association between urine cadmium concentrations and caries experience , adjusting these analyses for potential confounders including environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) .	
18560540-4	RESULTS Urine cadmium concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 3.38 ng/mL .	
18560540-5	Approximately 56% of children had experienced caries in their deciduous teeth , and almost 30% had been affected by caries in their permanent dentition .	1 11 112
18560540-6	An interquartile range ( IQR ) increase in creatinine-corrected cadmium concentrations ( 0.21 microg/g creatinine ) corresponded to a 16% increase in the odds of having experienced caries in deciduous teeth [ prevalence odds ratio ( OR)=1.16 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.96-1.40 ] .	
18560540-7	This association was statistically significant in children with low ETS exposure ( prevalence OR=1.30 ; 95% CI , 1.01-1.67 ) .	
18560540-8	The results from the ZINB regression indicated that , among children with any caries history in their deciduous teeth , an IQR increase in cadmium was associated with 17% increase in the number of decayed or filled surfaces .	
18560540-9	We observed no association between cadmium and caries experience in permanent teeth .	
18560540-10	CONCLUSIONS Environmental cadmium exposure may be associated with increased risk of dental caries in deciduous teeth of children .	
18560538-0	BACKGROUND It is well documented that acute exposure to high levels of persistent organic pollutants , such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , p,p'-dichlorophenyldichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) , and hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , can affect human health including thyroid function .	
18560538-1	Chronic exposure to multiple toxicants is common but difficult to analyze , and most prior studies have focused on adults or newborns , creating a gap in our understanding of multitoxicant effects among adolescents .	
18560538-2	OBJECTIVE We investigated whether levels of PCBs , p,p'-DDE , HCB , mirex , lead , and mercury reflecting past chronic exposure are associated with alterations in levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , triiodothyronine ( T(3) ) , total thyroxine ( TT(4) ) , and free thyroxine ( FT(4) ) among older children and adolescents .	11 12 11122 1 122 11123 111 1112
18560538-3	METHODS The sample consists of youth from the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation ( n=232 ) who reside in proximity to several industries that have contaminated the local environment .	
18560538-4	We used multiple regression analysis to examine the effect of PCB groupings , p,p'-DDE , HCB , lead , and mercury on thyroid hormones after adjusting for sociodemographic covariates and controlling for all other toxicants .	1 11 1112 111
18560538-5	RESULTS Exposure to PCBs affects the thyroid hormone profile in adolescents .	
18560538-6	The group of persistent PCBs was positively associated with TSH but inversely related to FT(4) .	
18560538-7	Nonpersistent PCBs were significantly and negatively related to FT(4) only .	
18560538-8	HCB was negatively associated with T(4) , and lead was positively associated with T(3) .	
18560538-9	Breast-fed adolescents had higher levels of persistent PCBs and p,p'-DDE but not of nonpersistent PCBs or any other toxicant when compared with non-breast-fed adolescents .	
18560538-10	Though having lower levels of persistent PCBs and p,p'-DDE , non-breast-fed adolescents exhibited significant relationships between persistent PCBs and TSH and FT(4) , but breast-fed adolescents did not .	
18560538-11	It appears that PCBs from breast milk obscure the relationship between prenatal PCB exposure and thyroid function by adding random variation in PCB levels .	
18560538-12	CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate a reduction in thyroid function in adolescents in relation to their current serum levels of PCBs .	1 122 12
18560538-13	These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that pre-natal exposure to PCBs alters thyroid function in a long-lasting manner but does not exclude the possibility that postnatal exposure is influential also .	
18795157-0	BACKGROUND Bone toxicity has been linked to organochlorine exposure following a few notable poisoning incidents , but epidemiologic studies in populations with environmental organochlorine exposure have yielded inconsistent results .	
18795157-1	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate whether organochlorine exposure was associated with bone mineral density ( BMD ) in a population 60-81 years of age ( 154 males , 167 females ) living near the Baltic coast , close to a river contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .	1 11 112
18795157-2	METHODS We measured forearm BMD in participants using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ; and we assessed low BMD using age- and sex-standardized Z-scores .	
18795157-3	We analyzed blood samples for five dioxin-like PCBs , the three most abundant non-dioxin-like PCBs , and p,p'-dichloro-phenyldichloroethylene ( p,p'-DDE ) .	1 122 12
18795157-4	RESULTS In males , dioxin-like chlorobiphenyl ( CB)-118 was negatively associated with BMD ; the odds ratio for low BMD ( Z-score less than -1 ) was 1.06 ( 95% confidence interval , 1.01-1.12 ) per 10 pg/mL CB-118 .	
18795157-5	The sum of the three most abundant non-dioxin-like PCBs was positively associated with BMD , but not with a decreased risk of low BMD .	
18795157-6	In females , CB-118 was positively associated with BMD , but this congener did not influence the risk of low BMD in women .	
18795157-7	CONCLUSIONS Environmental organochlorine exposures experienced by this population sample since the 1930s in Sweden may have been sufficient to result in sex-specific changes in BMD .	
18560528-0	BACKGROUND Exposure to toxic methylmercury ( MeHg ) through fish consumption is a large problem worldwide , and it has led to governmental recommendations of reduced fish consumption and blacklisting of mercury-contaminated fish .	
18560528-1	The elimination kinetics of MeHg varies greatly among individuals .	
18560528-2	Knowledge about the reasons for such variation is of importance for improving the risk assessment for MeHg .	
18560528-3	One possible explanation is hereditary differences in MeHg metabolism .	
18560528-4	MeHg is eliminated from the body as a glutathione ( GSH ) conjugate .	
18560528-5	OBJECTIVES We conducted this study to assess the influence of polymorphisms in GSH-synthesizing [ glutamyl-cysteine ligase modifier subunit ( GCLM-588 ) and glutamyl-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit ( GCLC-129) ] or GSH-conjugating [ glutathione S-transferase pi 1 ( GSTP1-105 and GSTP1-114) ] genes on MeHg retention .	
18560528-6	METHODS Based on information obtained from questionnaires , 292 subjects from northern Sweden had a high consumption of fish ( lean/fat fish two to three times per week or more ) .	24 2 243
18560528-7	We measured total Hg in erythrocytes ( Ery-Hg ) and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma ( P-PUFA ; an exposure marker for fish intake ) .	1 122 12
18560528-8	RESULTS The GSTP1 genotype modified Ery-Hg ; effects were seen for GSTP1-105 and -114 separately , and combining them resulted in stronger effects .	
18560528-9	We found evidence of effect modification : individuals with zero or one variant allele demonstrated a steeper regression slope for Ery-Hg ( p=0.038 ) compared with individuals with two or more variant alleles .	
18560528-10	The GCLM-588 genotype also influenced Ery-Hg ( p=0.035 ) : Individuals with the GCLM-588 TT genotype demonstrated the highest Ery-Hg , but we saw no evidence of effect modification with increasing P-PUFA .	
18560528-11	CONCLUSIONS These results suggest a role of GSH-related polymorphisms in MeHg metabolism .	
18505547-0	BACKGROUND Socio-economic status , smoking , and exposure to increased levels of environmental air pollution are associated with adverse effects on respiratory health .	
18505547-1	We assessed the contribution of occupational exposures , smoking and outdoor air pollution as competing factors for the association between socio-economic status and respiratory health indicators in a cohort of women from the Ruhr area aged 55 at the time of investigation between 1985 and 1990 .	
18505547-2	METHODS Data of 1251 women with spirometry and complete questionnaire information about respiratory diseases , smoking and potential confounders were used in the analyses .	1 11 112
18505547-3	Exposure to large-scale air pollution was assessed with data from monitoring stations .	2 231 23
18505547-4	Exposure to small-scale air pollution was assessed as traffic-related exposure by distance to the nearest major road .	2 231 23
18505547-5	Socio-economic status was defined by educational level .	
18505547-6	Multiple regression models were used to estimate the contribution of occupational exposures , smoking and outdoor air pollution to social differences in respiratory health .	
18505547-7	RESULTS Women with less than 10 years of school education in comparison to more than 10 years of school education were more often occupationally exposed ( 16.4% vs. 10.1% ) , smoked more often ( 20.3% vs. 13.9% ) , and lived more often close to major roads ( 26.0% vs. 22.9% ) .	
18505547-8	Long-term exposure to increased levels of PM10 was significantly associated with lower school education .	2 23
18505547-9	Women with low school education were more likely to suffer from respiratory symptoms and had reduced lung function .	
18505547-10	In the multivariate analysis the associations between education and respiratory health attenuated after adjusting for occupational exposure , smoking and outdoor air pollution .	
18505547-11	The crude odds ratio for the association between the lung function indicator FEV1 less than 80% of predicted value and educational level ( &lt;10 years vs. &gt;10 years of school education ) was 1.83 ( 95% CI : 1.22-2.74 ) .	1 11 112
18505547-12	This changed to 1.56 ( 95% CI : 1.03-2.37 ) after adjusting for occupational exposure , smoking and outdoor air pollution .	
18505547-13	CONCLUSION We found an association between socio-economic status and respiratory health .	
18505547-14	This can partly be explained by living conditions indicated by occupational exposure , smoking behaviour and ambient air pollution .	
18505547-15	A relevant part of the social differences in respiratory health , however , remained unexplained .	
18558431-0	Average concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) in dust in 30 homes , 18 offices , and 20 cars were 260,000 , 31,000 , and 340,000 ng SigmaPBDEs g(-1) respectively .	24 2 242
18558431-1	Concentrations of BDEs 47 , 99 , 100 , and 154 in cars exceeded significantly ( p&lt;0.05 ) those in homes and offices .	
18558431-2	Average concentrations of 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane ( TBE ) and decabromodiphenyl ethane ( DBDPE ) in homes , offices , and cars respectively were lower at 120 , 7.2 , and 7.7 ng g(-1) ( TBE ) and 270 , 170 , and 400 ng g(-1) ( DBDPE ) .	
18558431-3	BDE-209 concentrations in three samples are the highest to date at 2,600,000 ( car ) , 2,200,000 ( home ) , and 1,400,000 ng g(-1) ( home ) .	
18558431-4	UK toddlers daily consuming 200 mg dust contaminated at the 95th percentile concentration , ingest 180 ng ( Sigma)tri-hexa-BDEs and 310 microg BDE-209 day(-1) .	24 2 242
18558431-5	For TBE , exposure was lower than for PBDEs and hexabromocyclododecanes ( HBCDs ) , while that for DBDPE was similar in magnitude to ( Sigma)tri-hexa-BDEs , but less than for BDE-209 and HBCDs .	
18558431-6	BDE-209 concentrations recorded in ten samples taken at monthly intervals in one room varied 400-fold , implying caution when using single measurements of dust contamination for exposure assessment .	24 2 242
18558431-7	Significant negative correlation was observed in one room between concentrations of BDE-47 , 99 , and 153 and dust loading ( g dust m(-2) floor ) , suggesting " dilution " occurs at higher dust loadings .	
18485481-0	Volcanoes produce and release large amounts of toxicants , and the concentration of metals in hair can be used as a biomarker of exposure to trace metals .	1 12
18485481-1	In order to investigate whether humans exposed to volcanic emissions demonstrate higher concentrations of essential and non-essential trace metals , scalp hair of men ( 3-89 years ) living in two areas of the Azores , one exposed to volcanic emissions and the other not , was sampled , and their content in Cd , Cu , Pb , Rb , Se , and Zn was quantified by using High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry .	1 123 12
18485481-2	In average , men exposed to volcanic emissions presented higher concentrations of Cd ( 96.9 ppb ) , Cu ( 16.2 ppm ) , Pb ( 3417.6 ppb ) , Rb ( 216.3 ppb ) , and Zn ( 242.8 ppm ) , but not Se ( 469.6 ppb ) .	
18485481-3	Also , strong and significant correlations were found between Cd-Rb and Pb-Rb in the exposed men .	
18485481-4	In conclusion , humans living chronically exposed to volcanic emissions show high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace metals in scalp hair , and is suggested that this type of exposure may be as harmful as living close to industrial facilities .	
19036413-0	Estimating personal exposure to air pollution is a crucial component in identifying high-risk populations and situations .	2 233 23
19036413-1	It will enable policy makers to determine efficient control strategies .	
19036413-2	Cycling is again becoming a favorite mode of transport both in developing and in developed countries due to increasing traffic congestion and environmental concerns .	
19036413-3	In Europe , it is also seen as a healthy sports activity .	
19036413-4	However , due to high levels of hazardous pollutants in the present day road microenvironment the cyclist might be at a higher health risk due to higher breathing rate and proximity to the vehicular exhaust .	
19036413-5	In this paper we present estimates of the exposure of a cyclist to particles of various size fractions including ultrafine particles ( UFP ) in the town of Mol ( Flanders , Belgium ) .	2 23
19036413-6	The results indicate relatively higher UFP concentration exposure during morning office hours and moderate UFP levels during afternoon .	
19036413-7	The major sources of UFP and PM(10) were identified , which are vehicular emission and construction activities , respectively .	
19036413-8	We also present a dust mapping technique which can be a useful tool for town planners and local policy makers .	
18550560-0	In this study , the authors ' objective was to determine whether serum concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , hexachlorobenzene , p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane ( DDT ) , o,p'-DDT , and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene ( DDE ) are associated with thyroid function during pregnancy .	
18550560-1	These compounds , as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone , total thyroxine , and free thyroxine , were measured in serum samples collected between October 1999 and October 2000 from 334 pregnant women living in the Salinas Valley , California .	11 12 11122 1 122 11123 111 1112
18550560-2	Data were analyzed by multivariate linear regression .	
18550560-3	After adjustment for covariates , seven of the 19 PCB congeners detected in more than 75% of participants and the sum of those congeners were negatively associated with free thyroxine concentrations .	
18550560-4	PCBs 44 , 52 , and 183 remained significant after the exclusion of two outliers .	
18550560-5	Hexachlorobenzene concentrations were negatively associated with both free thyroxine and total thyroxine .	
18550560-6	PCB and hexachlorobenzene concentrations were strongly correlated , which hampered the authors ' ability to identify their independent associations with thyroid function .	
18550560-7	None of the exposures under study were associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone .	
18550560-8	Results suggest that exposure to PCBs and/or hexachlorobenzene at background levels may affect thyroid function during pregnancy .	
18550560-9	These findings are of particular significance , since thyroid hormones of maternal origin may play an essential role in fetal neurodevelopment .	
18470316-0	BACKGROUND Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are ubiquitous air pollutants generated by combustion of organic material , including fossil fuel .	
18470316-1	OBJECTIVES It has been an open question whether prenatal exposure to air pollution in general and PAHs in particular significantly increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction , including small size for gestational age ( SGA ) , and preterm delivery .	1 11 112
18470316-2	Here , we have examined this hypothesis in a cohort of mothers and newborns in New York City .	
18470316-3	METHODS Subjects were young , nonsmoking , healthy African-American ( n = 224 ) and Dominican ( n = 392 ) mother-newborn pairs residing in New York City whose prenatal PAH exposures were estimated by personal air monitoring .	23 2 233
18470316-4	Questionnaire and medical record data were obtained .	
18470316-5	RESULTS A 1 natural-log ( ln)-unit increase in prenatal PAH exposure was associated with a 2-fold increase in risk of symmetric intrauterine growth restriction ( i.e. , SGA and fetal growth ratio &lt ; 85% ) among full-term African Americans ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	1 11 112
18470316-6	Preterm delivery risk was 5-fold greater among African Americans per ln-unit increase in prenatal PAH exposure .	
18470316-7	The same unit increase in exposure significantly increased the ratio of head circumference to birth weight by 0.04% in African Americans .	1 11 112
18470316-8	These effects were not observed in Dominicans .	
18470316-9	CONCLUSION Prenatal PAH exposure is likely to contribute to the occurrence of SGA as well as preterm births among African Americans .	
18470316-10	The lack of an association in Dominicans might reflect modification of the risk by healthful cultural practices among recent Dominican immigrants .	
18470316-11	Given that PAHs are globally generated and distributed pollutants , our observations have potential implications for environmental health and energy policies .	
18824263-0	BACKGROUND Phthalates can disrupt endocrine function and induce reproductive and developmental toxicity in laboratory animals .	
18824263-1	Few studies have evaluated exposure to phthalates in pregnant women , despite the potential sensitivity of the developing fetus to adverse effects of phthalates .	
18824263-2	METHODS We measured urinary concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites in 19 pregnant women , recruited in Jerusalem , Israel in 2006 , and collected questionnaire data on demographic factors and consumer habits from these women .	1 12 127
18824263-3	We compared geometric mean concentrations in subgroups and used the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples to determine significant differences between groups .	
18824263-4	RESULTS Nine metabolites were detected in at least 95% of the samples : mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate , mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate , mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate , mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate , mono(n-butyl) phthalate , monobenzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) , monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and monoisobutyl phthalate .	
18824263-5	Phthalate metabolite concentrations in these pregnant women were remarkably similar to those in the general United States female population .	
18824263-6	MBzP geometric mean concentrations were higher in women living in buildings existing 40 years or more ( P=0.04 ) .	
18824263-7	In women who used four or more personal care products ( perfume , deodorant , lipstick , nail polish , or hand/face cream ) in the 48 h prior to providing the urine sample , geometric mean MEP concentrations were more than 4 times higher than concentrations in women using only two or three of the aforementioned products ( P=0.07 ) .	24 12 22 1 244 2 127
18824263-8	CONCLUSIONS Pregnant women in Jerusalem are exposed to a wide range of phthalates .	
18824263-9	Building materials used in old constructions may be a source of exposure to benzylbutyl phthalate , the parent compound of MBzP .	
18824263-10	Personal care products may be sources of exposure to diethyl phthalate , the parent compound of MEP .	
18550050-0	Particulate matter air pollution has been related to an increase in cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality especially in susceptible subjects with a known cardiopulmonary disease .	
18550050-1	Recent studies suggest that PM(2.5) air pollution was associated with changes in heart rate variability ( HRV ) .	1 11 112
18550050-2	The purpose of this study was to identify and compare changes in HRV in positive or negative head-up tilt ( HUT ) participants .	
18550050-3	Fifty two subjects , 31 women and 21 men , 20-40 years old , underwent PM(2.5) personal monitoring and Holter-ECG monitoring in supine and orthostatic position , during active standing , in indoor and outdoor environments .	11 23 1 2 112 233
18550050-4	All measurements were made between 8 and 11 AM in the same geographical location ( southeast of Mexico City ) .	
18550050-5	Frequency domain indexes were estimated in absolute ( ms(2) ) and in normalized units ( nu ) ( low frequencies ( LF ) , high frequencies ( HF ) and low/high frequency ratio ( LF/HF) ) in 5 min periods by standard methods .	
18550050-6	Data were transformed into natural logarithmic scale ( ln ) .	
18550050-7	Comparisons were made between genders and positive and negative HUT subjects .	
18550050-8	LF were larger and HF were smaller in negative HUT males .	
18550050-9	Multivariate analysis with GEE models , adjusted for each index , showed a significant decrease of HRV ( LFln -0.194 95% CI , -0.4509 , 0.0627 , and HFln -0.298 95% CI , -0.5553 , -0.0401 ) associated to an increase in PM(2.5) air pollution in positive and negative HUT subjects which was larger for HFln in outdoor environments .	2 23
18550050-10	PM(2.5) air pollution was associated with changes in HRV in positive and negative HUT subjects without cardiopulmonary disease .	2 23
18469625-0	OBJECTIVE Evidence demonstrates that occupational exposures are causally linked with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .	
18469625-1	This case-control study evaluated the association between occupational exposures and prevalent COPD based on lifetime occupational history .	2 21
18469625-2	METHODS Cases ( n = 388 ) aged 45 years and older with COPD were compared with controls ( n = 356 ) , frequency matched on age , sex , and cigarette smoking history .	
18469625-3	Odds ratios for exposure to each of eight occupational hazard categories and three composite measures of exposure were computed using logistic regression .	2
18469625-4	RESULTSOccupational exposures most strongly associated with COPD were diesel exhaust , irritant gases and vapors , mineral dust , and metal dust .	24 2 242
18469625-5	The composite measures describing aggregate exposure to gases , vapors , solvents , or sensitizers ( GVSS ) and aggregate exposure to dust , GVSS , or diesel exhaust were also associated with COPD .	24 23 2 242
18469625-6	In the small group of never-smokers , a similar pattern was evident .	
18469625-7	CONCLUSION These population-based findings add to the literature linking occupational exposures to COPD .	
18548326-0	Indoor and ambient concentrations of 21 volatile organic compounds ( including 14 hazardous air pollutants ) were measured in the homes of nearly 80 western Montana ( Missoula ) high school students as part of the ' Air Toxics Under the Big Sky ' program during the 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 school years .	2 232 23
18548326-1	Target analytes were measured using low flow air sampling pumps and sorbent tubes , with analysis of the exposed samples by thermal desorption/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( TD/GC/MS ) .	
18548326-2	The results reported here present the findings of the first indoor/ambient air toxics monitoring program conducted in a semi-rural valley location located in the Northern Rocky Mountain/Western Montana region .	
18548326-3	Of all of the air toxics quantified in this study , toluene was found to be the most abundant compound in both the indoor and ambient environments during each of the two school years .	
18548326-4	Indoor log-transformed mean concentrations were found to be higher when compared with ambient log-transformed mean concentrations at P &lt ; 0.001 for the majority of the compounds , supporting the results of previous studies conducted in urban areas .	
18548326-5	For the air toxics consistently measured throughout this program , concentrations were approximately six times higher inside the student's homes compared to those simultaneously measured directly outside their homes .	2 232 23
18548326-6	For the majority of the compounds , there were no significant correlations between indoor and ambient concentrations .	
18448091-0	This study examined the potential for pet dogs to be an important pathway for transporting diazinon residues into homes and onto its occupants following residential lawn applications .	24 244 2
18448091-1	The primary objectives were to investigate the potential exposures of occupants and their pet dogs to diazinon after an application to turf at their residences and to determine if personal contacts between occupants and their pet dogs resulted in measurable exposures .	
18448091-2	It was conducted from April to August 2001 before the Agency phased out all residential uses of diazinon in December 2004 .	
18448091-3	Six families and their pet dogs were recruited into the study .	
18448091-4	Monitoring was conducted at pre- , 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 days post-application of a commercial , granular formulation of diazinon to the lawn by the homeowner .	24 244 2
18448091-5	Environmental samples collected included soil , indoor air , carpet dust , and transferable residues from lawns and floors .	24 23 245 2 242 232
18448091-6	Samples collected from the pet dogs consisted of paw wipes , fur clippings , and transferable residues from the fur by a technician or child wearing a cotton glove(s) .	
18448091-7	First morning void ( FMV ) urine samples were collected from each child and his/her parent on each sampling day .	24 245 12 127 1 244 2 242
18448091-8	Diazinon was analyzed in all samples , except urine , by GC-MS .	
18448091-9	The metabolite 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine ( IMPy ) was analyzed in the urine samples by HPLC-MS/MS .	1 12 127
18448091-10	Mean airborne residues of diazinon on day 1 post-application were at least six times higher in both the living rooms ( 235+/-267 ng/m(3) ) and children's bedrooms ( 179+/-246 ng/m(3) ) than at pre-application .	2 232 23
18448091-11	Mean loadings of diazinon in carpet dust samples were at least 20 times greater on days 2 , 4 , and 8 post-application than mean loadings ( 0.03+/-0.04 ng/cm(2) ) at pre-application .	24 2 242
18448091-12	The pet dogs had over 900 times higher mean loadings of diazinon residues on their paws on day 1 post-application ( 88.1+/-100.1 ng/cm(2) ) compared to mean loadings ( &lt;0.09 ng/cm(2) ) at pre-application .	
18448091-13	The mean diazinon loadings on the fur clippings were at least 14 times higher on days 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 post-application than mean loadings ( 0.8+/-0.4 ng/cm(2) ) at pre-application .	
18448091-14	For transferable residues from dog fur , the mean loadings of diazinon on the technician's cotton glove samples were the lowest before application ( 0.04+/-0.08 ng/cm(2) ) and the highest on day 1 post-application ( 10.4+/-23.9 ng/cm(2) ) of diazinon to turf .	
18448091-15	Urinary IMPy concentrations for the participants ranged from &lt;0.3 to 5.5 ng/mL before application and &lt;0.3-12.5 ng/mL after application of diazinon .	1 12 127
18448091-16	The mean urinary IMPy concentrations for children or adults were not statistically different ( p&gt;0.05 ) at pre-application compared to post-application of diazinon to turf .	1 12 127
18448091-17	The results showed that the participants and their pet dogs were likely exposed to low levels of diazinon residues from several sources ( i.e. , air , dust , and soil ) , through several pathways and routes , after lawn applications at these residences .	
18448091-18	Lastly , the pet dog appears to be an important pathway for the transfer and translocation of diazinon residues inside the homes and likely exposed occupants through personal contacts ( i.e. , petting ) .	
19092498-0	OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the effect of non-occupational exposure to manganese ( Mn ) on postural balance .	
19092498-1	METHODS Residents living near a ferromanganese refinery provided hair and blood samples after postural balance testing .	11 12 1 122 123 112
19092498-2	The relationship between hair Mn and postural balance was analyzed with logistic regression .	
19092498-3	Following covariate adjustment , postural balance was compared with control data by analysis of covariance .	
19092498-4	RESULTS Mean hair Mn was 4.4 microg/g .	
19092498-5	A significantly positive association was found between hair Mn and sway area ( eyes open on the platform , P = 0.05 ; eyes closed on the platform , P = 0.04 ) and sway length ( eyes open on the platform , P = 0.05 ; eyes closed on the platform , P = 0.04 ) .	1 11 112
19092498-6	Postural balance of residents was significantly larger than controls in 5 out of 8 postural balance outcomes .	
19092498-7	CONCLUSION Preliminary findings suggest subclinical impairment in postural balance among residents chronically exposed to ambient Mn .	
19092498-8	A prospective study with a larger sample size is warranted .	
18514186-0	BACKGROUND Primitive electronic waste ( e-waste ) recycling is ongoing in Guiyu , and thus toxic heavy metals may keep on threatening to the health of local children .	
18514186-1	Some related factors may contribute to the elevation of blood lead levels ( BLLs ) or blood cadmium levels ( BCLs ) .	1 122 12
18514186-2	OBJECTIVE To investigate the children's BLLs and BCLs in Guiyu and Chendian as compare to discuss the effects of primitive e-waste recycling activities on children's health .	
18514186-3	METHODS Two hundred and seventy-eight children less than 8 years who lived in Guiyu and Chendian were observed , and their BLLs and BCLs were determined by graphite atomizer absorption spectrophotometer .	1 122 12
18514186-4	Questionnaire survey for risk factors was also performed and data were analyzed using spearman correlation analyses and logistic regression analyses .	
18514186-5	RESULTS Children living in Guiyu had significantly higher BLLs and BCLs as compared with those living in Chendian ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
18514186-6	In Guiyu , 70.8% of children ( 109/154 ) had BLLs&gt;10 microg/dL , and 20.1% of children ( 31/154 ) had BCLs&gt;2 microg/L , compared with 38.7% of children ( 48/124 ) had BLLs&gt;10 microg/dL and 7.3% of children ( 9/124 ) had BCLs&gt;2 microg/L in Chendian ( p&lt;0.01 , respectively ) .	
18514186-7	We also observed a significant increasing trend in BLLs with increasing age in Guiyu ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
18514186-8	Mean height of children in Guiyu was significantly lower than that in Chendian ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
18514186-9	The risk factors related to children's BLLs and BCLs mainly included father's engagement in the work related to e-waste , children's residence in Guiyu and the amount of time that children played outside near the road everyday .	
18514186-10	CONCLUSIONS There are close relationships between the BLLs , BCLs in children and the primitive e-waste recycling activities in Guiyu .	
18514186-11	Environmental pollution , especially lead pollution , has threatened the health of children living around e-waste recycling site .	
19101017-0	Swimming pool water must be treated to prevent infections caused by microbial pathogens .	
19101017-1	In Korea , the most commonly used disinfection methods include the application of chlorine , ozone/chlorine , and a technique that uses electrochemically generated mixed oxidants ( EGMOs ) .	
19101017-2	The purpose of this study was to estimate the concentrations of total trihalomethanes ( TTHMs ) in indoor swimming pools adopting these disinfection methods , and to examine the correlations between the concentrations of THMs and TTHMs and other factors affecting the production of THMs .	
19101017-3	We also estimated the lifetime cancer risks associated with various exposure pathways by THMs in swimming pools .	2
19101017-4	Water samples were collected from 183 indoor swimming pools in Seoul , Korea , and were analyzed for concentrations of each THM , TOC , and the amount of KMnO(4) consumption .	24 2 241
19101017-5	The free chlorine residual and the pH of the pool water samples were also measured .	24 2 241
19101017-6	The geometric mean concentrations of TTHMs in the swimming pool waters were 32.9+/-2.4 microg/L for chlorine , 23.3+/-2.2 microg/L for ozone/chlorine , and 58.2+/-1.7 microg/L for EGMO .	
19101017-7	The concentrations of THMs differed significantly among the three treatment methods , and the correlation between THMs and TTHMs and the other factors influencing THMs varied .	
19101017-8	The lifetime cancer risk estimation showed that , while risks from oral ingestion and dermal exposure to THMs are mostly less than 10(-6) , which is the negligible risk level defined by the US EPA , however swimmers can be at the greater risk from inhalation exposure ( 7.77x10(-4)-1.36x10(-3) ) .	24 2 22 23
18414631-0	BACKGROUND Blood pressure ( BP ) may be implicated in associations observed between ambient particulate matter and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .	1 11 112
18414631-1	This study examined cross-sectional associations between short-term ambient fine particles ( particulate matter &lt;or= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ; PM(2.5) ) and BP : systolic ( SBP ) , diastolic ( DBP ) , mean arterial ( MAP ) , and pulse pressure ( PP ) .	11 1 2 112 23
18414631-2	METHODS The study sample included 5,112 persons 45-84 years of age , free of cardiovascular disease at the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis baseline examination ( 2000-2002 ) .	
18414631-3	Data from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency monitors were used to estimate ambient PM(2.5) exposures for the preceding 1 , 2 , 7 , 30 , and 60 days .	2 231 23
18414631-4	Roadway data were used to estimate local exposures to traffic-related particles .	2 231 23
18414631-5	RESULTS Results from linear regression found PP and SBP positively associated with PM(2.5) .	
18414631-6	For example , a 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) 30-day mean was associated with 1.12 mmHg higher pulse pressure [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.28-1.97 ] and 0.99 mmHg higher systolic BP ( 95% CI , -0.15 to 2.13 ) , adjusted for age , sex , race/ethnicity , income , education , body mass index , diabetes , cigarette smoking and environmental tobacco smoke , alcohol use , physical activity , medications , atmospheric pressure , and temperature .	
18414631-7	Results were much weaker and not statistically significant for MAP and DBP .	
18414631-8	Although traffic-related variables were not themselves associated with BP , the association between PM(2.5) and BP was stronger in the presence of higher traffic exposure .	
18414631-9	CONCLUSIONS Higher SBP and PP were associated with ambient levels of PM(2.5) and the association was stronger in the presence of roadway traffic , suggesting that impairment of blood pressure regulation may play a role in response to air pollution .	
18938653-0	BACKGROUND Winds from the Sahara-Sahel desert region regularly transport large amounts of dust to the Americas , North Africa , and Europe .	
18938653-1	The presence of high dust concentrations for long periods of time , and the interaction between dust and man-made air pollution , raise concerns about adverse health effects and appropriate interventions by health authorities .	
18938653-2	This study tested the hypothesis that outbreaks of Saharan dust exacerbate the effects of man-made pollution , specifically fine and coarse particulate matter ( PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 , respectively ) on daily mortality .	
18938653-3	METHODS We investigated the effects of exposure to PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 between March 2003 and December 2004 in Barcelona ( Spain ) on daily mortality ; changes of effects between Saharan and non-Saharan dust days were assessed using a time-stratified case-crossover design .	2 231 23
18938653-4	We studied the chemical composition of particulate matter to explain changes of effects .	
18938653-5	RESULTS The study included 24,850 deaths .	
18938653-6	During Saharan dust days , a daily increase of 10 microg/m3 of PM10-2.5 increased daily mortality by 8.4% ( 95% confidence interval = 1.5%-15.8% ) compared with 1.4% ( -0.8% to 3.4% ) during non-Saharan dust days ( P value for interaction = 0.05 ) .	2 231 23
18938653-7	In contrast , there was no increased risk of daily mortality for PM2.5 during Saharan dust days .	
18938653-8	Although coarse particles seem to be more hazardous during Saharan dust days , differences in chemical composition did not explain these observations .	
18938653-9	CONCLUSIONS Saharan dust outbreaks may have adverse health effects .	
18938653-10	Further investigation is needed to understand the role of coarse particles and the mechanism by which Saharan dust increases mortality .	
19337523-0	BACKGROUND Lead-contaminated house dust is a major source of lead exposure for children in the United States .	
19337523-1	In 1999-2004 , the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) collected dust lead ( PbD ) loading samples from the homes of children 12-60 months of age .	24 2 242
19337523-2	OBJECTIVES In this study we aimed to compare national PbD levels with existing health-based standards and to identify housing and demographic factors associated with floor and windowsill PbD .	
19337523-3	METHODS We used NHANES PbD data ( n=2,065 from floors and n=1,618 from windowsills ) and covariates to construct linear and logistic regression models .	
19337523-4	RESULTS The population-weighted geometric mean floor and windowsill PbD were 0.5 microg/ft2 [ geometric standard error ( GSE)=1.0 ] and 7.6 microg/ft2 ( GSE=1.0 ) , respectively .	
19337523-5	Only 0.16% of the floors and 4.0% of the sills had PbD at or above current federal standards of 40 and 250 microg/ft2 , respectively .	
19337523-6	Income , race/ethnicity , floor surface/condition , windowsill PbD , year of construction , recent renovation , smoking , and survey year were significant predictors of floor PbD [ the proportion of variability in the dependent variable accounted for by the model ( R2)=35% ] .	
19337523-7	A similar set of predictors plus the presence of large areas of exterior deteriorated paint in pre-1950 homes and the presence of interior deteriorated paint explained 20% of the variability in sill PbD .	
19337523-8	A companion article [ Dixon et al .	
19337523-9	Environ Health Perspect 117:468-474 ( 2009) ] describes the relationship between children's blood lead and PbD .	
19337523-10	CONCLUSION Most houses with children have PbD levels that comply with federal standards but may put children at risk .	
19337523-11	Factors associated with PbD in our population-based models are primarily the same as factors identified in smaller at-risk cohorts .	
19337523-12	PbD on floors and windowsills should be kept as low as possible to protect children .	
19337524-0	BACKGROUND The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collected health , housing , and environmental data in a single integrated national survey for the first time in the United States in 1999-2004 .	
19337524-1	OBJECTIVES We aimed to determine how floor dust lead ( PbD ) loadings and other housing factors influence childhood blood lead ( PbB ) levels and lead poisoning .	24 12 1 122 2 242
19337524-2	METHODS We analyzed data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) , including 2,155 children 12-60 months of age with PbB and PbD measurements .	
19337524-3	We used linear and logistic regression models to predict log-transformed PbB and the odds that PbB was &gt;or=5 and &gt;or=10 microg/dL at a range of floor PbD .	
19337524-4	RESULTS The population-weighted geometric mean ( GM ) PbB was 2.0 microg/dL ( geometric standard error=1.0 ) .	
19337524-5	Age of child , race/ethnicity , serum cotinine concentration , poverty-to-income ratio , country of birth , year of building construction , floor PbD by floor surface and condition , windowsill PbD , presence of deteriorated paint , home-apartment type , smoking in the home , and recent renovation were significant predictors in either the linear model [ the proportion of variability in the dependent variable accounted for by the model ( R2)=40% ] or logistic model for 10 microg/dL ( R2=5% ) .	
19337524-6	At floor PbD=12 microg/ft2 , the models predict that 4.6% of children living in homes constructed before 1978 have PbB&gt;or=10 microg/dL , 27% have PbB&gt;or=5 microg/dL , and the GM PbB is 3.9 microg/dL .	24 2 242
19337524-7	CONCLUSIONS Lowering the floor PbD standard below the current standard of 40 microg/ft2 would protect more children from elevated PbB .	
18379431-0	BACKGROUND Outdoor concentrations of soot and nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) outside of schools have been associated with children's respiratory and eye symptoms .	
18379431-1	We assessed how adjustments for measurement error affect these associations .	
18379431-2	METHODS Concentrations of air pollutants outside children's schools were validated by personal measurements of exposure to traffic-related air pollution .	23 2 233
18379431-3	We estimated prevalence ratios of 4 health outcomes ( current wheeze , conjunctivitis , phlegm , and elevated total serum immunoglobulin E ) using school outdoor measurements , and then adjusted for measurement error using the personal exposure data and applying a regression calibration method .	11 23 1 2 111 11123 1112 233
18379431-4	The analysis adjusting for measurement error was carried out using a main study/external validation design .	
18379431-5	RESULTS Adjusting for measurement error produced effect estimates related to soot and NO2 that were 2 to 3 times higher than in the original study .	
18379431-6	The adjusted prevalence ratio for current phlegm was 5.3 ( 95% confidence interval = 1.2-23 ) for a 9.3 microg/m3 increase in soot , and 3.8 ( 1.0-14 ) , for a 17.6 microg/m3 increase in NO2 , compared with the original results of 2.2 ( 1.3-3.9 ) and 1.8 ( 1.1-2.8 ) , respectively .	
18379431-7	Corrections were of similar magnitude for the prevalence of current wheeze , current conjunctivitis , and total elevated total immunoglobulin E. CONCLUSIONS The estimated effects of outdoor air pollution on respiratory and other health effects in children may be substantially attenuated when based on exposure measurements outside schools instead of personal exposure .	
18379426-0	BACKGROUND Urban air pollution can trigger asthma symptoms in children , but there is conflicting evidence on effects of long-term exposure on lung function , onset of airway disease and allergic sensitization .	
18379426-1	METHODS The spatial distribution of nitrogen oxides from traffic ( traffic-NOx ) and inhalable particulate matter from traffic ( traffic-PM10 ) in the study area was assessed with emission databases and dispersion modeling .	2 231 23
18379426-2	Estimated levels were used to assign first-year exposure levels for children in a prospective birth cohort ( n = 4089 ) , by linking to geocoded home addresses .	2 231 23
18379426-3	Parents in 4 Swedish municipalities provided questionnaire data on symptoms and exposures when the children were 2 months and 1 , 2 , and 4-year-old .	
18379426-4	At 4 years , 73% of the children underwent clinical examination including peak expiratory flow and specific IgE measurements .	11 1 11123 111 112 1112
18379426-5	RESULTS Exposure to air pollution from traffic during the first year of life was associated with an excess risk of persistent wheezing ( odds ratio [ OR ] for 44 microg/m3 [ 5th-95th percentile ] difference in traffic-NOx = 1.60 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.09-2.36 ) .	2 231 23
18379426-6	Similar results were found for sensitization ( measured as specific IgE ) to inhalant allergens , especially pollen ( OR for traffic-NOx = 1.67 ; 95% CI = 1.10-2.53 ) , at the age of 4 years .	
18379426-7	Traffic-related air pollution exposure during the first year of life was also associated with lower lung function at 4 years of age .	
18379426-8	Results were similar using traffic-NOx and traffic-PM10 as indicators .	
18379426-9	CONCLUSIONS Exposure to moderate levels of locally emitted air pollution from traffic early in life appears to influence the development of airway disease and sensitization in preschool children .	
18379423-0	BACKGROUND Laboratory evidence suggests tap water disinfection by-products ( DBPs ) could have an effect very early in pregnancy , typically before clinical detectability .	24 2 241
18379423-1	Undetected early losses would be expected to increase the reported number of cycles to clinical pregnancy .	
18379423-2	METHODS We investigated the association between specific DBPs ( trihalomethanes , haloacetic acids , brominated-trihalomethanes , brominated-haloacetic acids , total organic halides , and bromodichloromethane ) and time to pregnancy among women who enrolled in a study of drinking water and reproductive outcomes .	1 11 112
18379423-3	We quantified exposure to DBPs through concentrations in tap water , quantity ingested through drinking , quantity inhaled or absorbed while showering or bathing , and total integrated exposure .	24 2 241 22 23
18379423-4	The effect of DBPs on time to pregnancy was estimated using a discrete time hazard model .	
18379423-5	RESULTS Overall , we found no evidence of an increased time to pregnancy among women who were exposed to higher levels of DBPs .	
18379423-6	A modestly decreased time to pregnancy ( ie , increased fecundability ) was seen among those exposed to the highest level of ingested DBPs , but not for tap water concentration , the amount absorbed while showering or bathing , or the integrated exposure .	
18379423-7	CONCLUSIONS Our findings extend those of a recently published study suggesting a lack of association between DBPs and pregnancy loss .	
19479019-0	BACKGROUND The relationship of domestic endotoxin exposure to allergy and asthma has been widely investigated .	
19479019-1	However , few studies have evaluated predictors of household endotoxin , and none have done so for multiple locations within homes and on a national scale .	
19479019-2	OBJECTIVES We assayed 2,552 house dust samples in a nationwide study to understand the predictors of household endotoxin in bedroom floors , family room floors , beds , kitchen floors , and family room sofas .	24 2 242
19479019-3	METHODS Reservoir house dust from five locations within homes was assayed for endotoxin and demographic and housing information was assessed through questionnaire and onsite evaluation of 2,456 residents of 831 homes selected to represent national demographics .	24 2 242
19479019-4	We performed repeated-measures analysis of variance ( rANOVA ) for 37 candidate variables to identify independent predictors of endotoxin .	
19479019-5	Meteorologic data were obtained for each primary sampling unit and tested as predictors of indoor endotoxin to determine if wetter or warmer microclimates were associated with higher endotoxin levels .	
19479019-6	RESULTS Weighted geometric mean endotoxin concentration ranged from 18.7 to 80.5 endotoxin units ( EU)/mg for the five sampling locations , and endotoxin load ranged from 4,160 to 19,500 EU/m(2) .	
19479019-7	Bivariate analyses and rANOVA demonstrated that major predictors of endotoxin concentration were sampling location in the home , census division , educational attainment , presence of children , current dog ownership , resident-described problems with cockroaches , food debris , cockroach stains , and evidence of smoking observed by field staff .	
19479019-8	Low household income entered the model if educational attainment was removed .	
19479019-9	CONCLUSION Increased endotoxin in household reservoir dust is principally associated with poverty , people , pets , household cleanliness , and geography .	
18470315-0	BACKGROUND Evidence suggests that air pollution exposure adversely affects pregnancy outcomes .	
18470315-1	Few studies have examined individual-level intraurban exposure contrasts .	
18470315-2	OBJECTIVES We evaluated the impacts of air pollution on small for gestational age ( SGA ) birth weight , low full-term birth weight ( LBW ) , and preterm birth using spatiotemporal exposure metrics .	1 11 112
18470315-3	METHODS With linked administrative data , we identified 70,249 singleton births ( 1999-2002 ) with complete covariate data ( sex , ethnicity , parity , birth month and year , income , education ) and maternal residential history in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .	
18470315-4	We estimated residential exposures by month of pregnancy using nearest and inverse-distance weighting ( IDW ) of study area monitors [ carbon monoxide , nitrogen dioxide , nitric oxide , ozone , sulfur dioxide , and particulate matter &lt ; 2.5 ( PM2.5 ) or &lt ; 10 ( PM10 ) microm in aerodynamic diameter ] , temporally adjusted land use regression ( LUR ) models ( NO , NO2 , PM2.5 , black carbon ) , and proximity to major roads .	2 231 23
18470315-5	Using logistic regression , we estimated the risk of mean ( entire pregnancy , first and last month of pregnancy , first and last 3 months ) air pollution concentrations on SGA ( &lt ; 10th percentile ) , term LBW ( &lt ; 2,500 g ) , and preterm birth .	2 231 23
18470315-6	RESULTS Residence within 50 m of highways was associated with a 22% ( 95% CI , 0.81-1.87 ) [ corrected ] increase in LBW .	
18470315-7	Exposure to all air pollutants except O3 was associated with SGA , with similar odds ratios ( ORs ) for LUR and monitoring estimates ( e.g. , LUR : OR = 1.02 ; 95% CI , 1.00-1.04 ; IDW : OR = 1.05 ; 95% CI , 1.03-1.08 per 10-microg/m3 increase in NO ) .	
18470315-8	For preterm births , associations were observed with PM2.5 for births &lt ; 37 weeks gestation ( and for other pollutants at &lt ; 30 weeks ) .	
18470315-9	No consistent patterns suggested exposure windows of greater relevance .	
18470315-10	CONCLUSION Associations between traffic-related air pollution and birth outcomes were observed in a population-based cohort with relatively low ambient air pollution exposure .	
19479025-0	BACKGROUND The University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study ( UMDES ) was undertaken in response to concerns that the discharge of dioxin-like compounds from the Dow Chemical Company facilities in Midland , Michigan , resulted in contamination of soils in the Tittabawassee River floodplain and areas of the city of Midland , leading to an increase in residents ' body burdens of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans .	
19479025-1	OBJECTIVES The UMDES is a hypothesis-driven study designed to answer important questions about human exposure to dioxins in the environment of Midland , where the Dow Chemical Company has operated for &gt ; 100 years , and in neighboring Saginaw , Michigan .	
19479025-2	In addition , the UMDES includes a referent population from an area of Michigan in which there are no unusual sources of dioxin exposure and from which inferences regarding the general Michigan population can be derived .	
19479025-3	A central goal of the study is to determine which factors explain variation in serum dioxin levels and to quantify how much variation each factor explains .	1 122 12
19479025-4	CONCLUSIONS In this article we describe the study design and methods for a large population-based study of dioxin contamination and its relationship to blood dioxin levels .	1 122 12
19479025-5	The study collected questionnaire , blood , dust , and soil samples on 731 people .	24 245 12 1 122 2 242
19479025-6	This study provides a foundation for understanding the exposure pathways by which dioxins in soils , sediments , fish and game , and homegrown produce lead to increased body burdens of these compounds .	245 24 2 243
22503716-0	Human biomonitoring of nickel has gained interest in environmental medicine due to its wide distribution in the environment and its allergenic potential .	
22503716-1	There are indications that the prevalence of nickel sensitization in children is increased by nickel exposure and that oral uptake of nickel can exacerbate nickel dermatitis in nickel-sensitive individuals .	
22503716-2	Urinary nickel measurement is a good indicator of exposure .	
22503716-3	However , data on nickel levels in urine of children are rare .	
22503716-4	For the first time , the German Environmental Survey on children ( GerES IV ) 2003-2006 provided representative data to describe the internal nickel exposure of children aged 3-14 years in Germany .	24 2 241 243
22503716-5	Nickel was measured after enrichment in the organic phase of urine by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman background correction .	1 12 127
22503716-6	Nickel levels ( n=1576 ) ranged from &lt;0.5 to 15 Î¼g/l .	
22503716-7	Geometric mean was 1.26 Î¼g/l .	
22503716-8	Multivariate regression analysis showed that gender , age , socio-economic status , being overweighted , consumption of hazelnut spread , nuts , cereals , chocolate and urinary creatinine were significant predictors for urinary nickel excretion of children who do not smoke. 20.2% of the variance could be explained by these variables .	24 12 1 2 243 127
22503716-9	With a contribution of 13.8% the urinary creatinine concentration was the most important predictor .	
22503716-10	No influence of nickel intake via drinking water and second hand smoke exposure was observed .	24 2 241
22527464-0	The World Health Organization has estimated that air pollution is responsible for 1.4 % of all deaths and 0.8 % of disability-adjusted life years .	
22527464-1	NOIDA , located at the National Capital Region , India , was declared as one of the critically air-polluted areas by the Central Pollution Control Board of the Government of India .	
22527464-2	Studies on the relationship of reduction in lung functions of residents living in areas with higher concentrations of particulate matter ( PM ) in ambient air were inconclusive since the subjects of most of the studies are hospital admission cases .	
22527464-3	Very few studies , including one from India , have shown the relationship of PM concentration and its effects of lung functions in the same location .	
22527464-4	Hence , a cross-sectional study was undertaken to study the effect of particulate matter concentration in ambient air on the lung functions of residents living in a critically air-polluted area in India .	11 1 2 112 23
22527464-5	PM concentrations in ambient air ( PM(1,) PM(2.5) ) were monitored at residential locations and identified locations with higher ( NOIDA ) and lower concentrations ( Gurgaon ) .	2 231 23
22527464-6	Lung function tests ( FEV(1) , PEFR ) were conducted using a spirometer in 757 residents .	1 11 112
22527464-7	Both air monitoring and lung function tests were conducted on the same day .	
22527464-8	Significant negative linear relationship exists between higher concentrations of PM(1) with reduced FEV(1) and increased concentrations of PM(2.5) with reduced PEFR and FEV(1) .	
22527464-9	The study shows that reductions in lung functions ( PEFR and FEV(1) ) can be attributed to higher particulate matter concentrations in ambient air .	2 23
22527464-10	Decline in airflow obstruction in subjects exposed to high PM concentrations can be attributed to the fibrogenic response and associated airway wall remodeling .	
22527464-11	The study suggests the intervention of policy makers and stake holders to take necessary steps to reduce the emissions of PM concentrations , especially PM(1,) PM(2.5) , which can lead to serious respiratory health concerns in residents .	
18952285-0	Twenty five human breast adipose tissue samples were collected in Porto Alegre , Brazil during 2004-2005 and analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) .	1 121 12
18952285-1	SigmaPBDE concentrations ( sum of tri- to hepta-BDEs ) ranged from 0.19 to 132 ng/g lipid with a median of 1.51 ng/g lipid .	
18952285-2	These concentrations are 3- to 100-times lower than those reported from other countries , with the exception of Japan , probably reflecting lower usage of PBDE-containing products or lower exposures to these chemicals .	
18952285-3	The predominant congener was BDE-47 , followed by BDEs 99 , 183 , 153 and 100 .	
18952285-4	One individual in the dataset had about 70-times higher PBDE concentrations than the rest of the participants .	
18952285-5	SigmaPCB ( sum of PCBs 118 , 138 , 153 , 180 ) ranged from 30 to 339 ng/g lipid , with a median of 51 ng/g lipid .	
18952285-6	No age dependency was found for PBDEs ( r=-0.800-0.374 , p&gt;0.05 ) or PCB 180 ( r=0.278 , p&gt;0.05 ) .	
18952285-7	On the other hand , PCBs 118 , 138 and 153 did show age dependency ( r=0.410-0.458 , p&lt;0.05 ) .	
18952285-8	This is the first study to report levels of PBDEs in human breast adipose from Brazil .	1 121 12
22805991-0	Adverse birth outcomes are associated with exposure to air pollution during pregnancy .	
22805991-1	Road proximity is a simple , widely available metric for capturing local variation in exposure to traffic-related air pollution .	
22805991-2	We characterized maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy using residential proximity to major roadways among 2004-2008 singleton births in NC .	2 231 23
22805991-3	Controlling for maternal race , age , education , nativity , marital status , and tobacco use , and season of birth , parity , infant sex , and Census tract-level urbanization and income , we evaluated the association between road proximity and pregnancy outcomes using generalized linear mixed models with a random intercept for each Census tract .	11 23 1 2 112 231
22805991-4	Birth weight , birth weight percentile for gestational age , gestational hypertension , and small-for-gestational age were not associated with road proximity ; however , women residing within 250âm of a major roadway were at 3-5% increased odds of low birth weight , preterm birth , and late preterm birth compared with women residing beyond 250âm ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	1 11 112
22805991-5	Our analyses demonstrate an association between proximity to major roadways and pregnancy outcomes using a large sample .	
22805991-6	Road proximity may represent a relatively straightforward method for assessing maternal risk from exposure to traffic-related air pollution , with results offering guidance for studies that can more accurately characterize air pollution exposures .	2 23
18460444-0	Perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) are widespread persistent organic pollutants that have been associated with reduced birth weight at doses expected in many pregnant populations .	
18460444-1	The authors randomly selected 1,400 pregnant women and their newborns from the Danish National Birth Cohort ( 1996-2002 ) to investigate whether these compounds reduce organ growth .	
18460444-2	PFOS and PFOA were measured in maternal blood samples taken early in pregnancy .	1 122 12
18460444-3	Placental weight , birth length , and head and abdominal circumferences were measured shortly after birth by trained midwives or nurses .	1 11 112
18460444-4	Maternal PFOA levels in early pregnancy were associated with smaller abdominal circumference and birth length .	
18460444-5	For each ng/ml increase in PFOA , birth length decreased by 0.069 cm ( 95% confidence interval : 0.024 , 0.113 ) and abdominal circumference decreased by 0.059 cm ( 95% confidence interval : 0.012 , 0.106 ) .	
18460444-6	An inverse association was also observed between PFOA and placental weight and head circumference , and a positive association was observed with newborn ponderal index , but none of these associations was statistically significant .	1 11 112
18460444-7	Maternal PFOS levels were not associated with any of the five fetal growth indicators .	1 11 112
18460444-8	These findings suggest that fetal exposure to PFOA but not PFOS during organ development may affect the growth of organs and the skeleton .	
22821700-0	OBJECTIVE Assess the national prevalence of current workplace exposure to potential skin hazards , secondhand smoke ( SHS ) , and outdoor work among various industry and occupation groups .	2 22
22821700-1	Also , assess the national prevalence of chronic workplace exposure to vapors , gas , dust , and fumes ( VGDF ) among these groups .	24 2 242 232 23
22821700-2	METHODS Data were obtained from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS ) .	
22821700-3	NHIS is a multistage probability sample survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population of the US .	
22821700-4	Prevalence rates and their variances were calculated using SUDAAN to account for the complex NHIS sample design .	
22821700-5	RESULTS The data for 2010 were available for 17,524 adults who worked in the 12 months that preceded interview .	
22821700-6	The highest prevalence rates of hazardous workplace exposures were typically in agriculture , mining , and construction .	
22821700-7	The prevalence rate of frequent handling of or skin contact with chemicals , and of non-smokers frequently exposed to SHS at work was highest in mining and construction .	2 22
22821700-8	Outdoor work was most common in agriculture ( 85% ) , construction ( 73% ) , and mining ( 65% ) .	
22821700-9	Finally , frequent occupational exposure to VGDF was most common among mining ( 67% ) , agriculture ( 53% ) , and construction workers ( 51% ) .	
22821700-10	CONCLUSION We identified industries and occupations with the highest prevalence of potentially hazardous workplace exposures , and provided targets for investigation and intervention activities .	
18459140-0	BACKGROUND We evaluated particulate matter in combined induced sputum ( IS ) and oxidation in exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) to test whether underlying inflammatory changes are present in asymptomatic welders .	1 12 125
18459140-1	METHODS Thirty welders from the Israel Defense Forces exposed to aluminum/iron ( Group 1 ) or to cadmium/chromium/iron/lead/nickel ( Group 2 , N = 16 ) and 27 non-exposed administrators were studied .	
18459140-2	IS was recovered , particle size distribution , hydrogen peroxide and pH were measured , and exhaled breath condensate was collected .	
18459140-3	RESULTS Group 2 had a higher % neutrophils than all other participants ( P = 0.0001 ) and a higher % particles &gt;2 microm in diameter ( P = 0.0017 ) .	1 11 1113 111
18459140-4	Percent particles and years of exposure highly correlated ( P = 0.051 ) .	
18459140-5	All welders EBC samples had higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide than controls ( P = 0.0001). pH was lower only for Group 2 ( P = 0.0001 ) .	11 1 11122 1112 111
18459140-6	CONCLUSIONS Combined IS and EBC measurements detect underlying inflammation in airways of asymptomatic welders .	
18459140-7	It emerged that airway inflammation is present in asymptomatic welders , and that the particle burden , inflammatory cells , and level of oxidative stress are a function of the type and the duration of welding .	1 11 111 1114

18996050-0	PURPOSE A scientific review panel for the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently identified the need for more data on the health risk of mercury exposure from dental amalgam among susceptible populations .	
18996050-1	We evaluated impacts of low-level mercury exposure on renal function and neurobehavioral and neuropsychological performance among children .	
18996050-2	METHODS Dental histories for 403 children aged 7-11 years in five schools from Xuhui , Shanghai were checked by dentists .	24 244 2
18996050-3	Of them , 198 with confirmed amalgam fillings were recruited ( exposure group ) .	24 244 2
18996050-4	Reference children ( N=205 ) were those who never had dental amalgam treatment .	
18996050-5	In May 2004 , each child provided a urine sample for measurements of total mercury , N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity , microalbumin , and creatinine ( Cr ) .	11 12 1 11123 111 127 1112
18996050-6	The Child Behavior Checklist , Eysenck Personality Questionnaire , and an intelligence screening test were administered .	1 11 112
18996050-7	RESULTS The geometric mean urinary mercury concentration was 1.6 microg/g Cr for children with and 1.4 microg/g Cr for children without amalgam fillings .	24 12 1 244 2 127
18996050-8	No differences were found between children with and without fillings for either renal function biomarker , or on neurobehavioral , neuropsychological , or intelligence tests .	11 1 112
18996050-9	CONCLUSIONS Although urinary mercury concentration was slightly elevated among children with amalgam fillings , we found no evidence of adverse effects on the outcomes evaluated .	
18996050-10	These results agree with those from recent trials in developed countries .	
18288321-0	BACKGROUND Increased risk of various congenital anomalies has been reported to be associated with trihalomethane ( THM ) exposure in the water supply .	
18288321-1	OBJECTIVES We conducted a registry-based study to determine the relationship between THM concentrations and the risk of congenital anomalies in England and Wales .	1 11 112
18288321-2	METHODS We obtained congenital anomaly data from the National Congenital Anomalies System , regional registries , and the national terminations registry ; THM data were obtained from water companies .	24 2 241
18288321-3	Total THM ( &lt ; 30 , 30 to &lt ; 60 , &gt ; or =60 microg/L ) , total brominated exposure ( &lt ; 10 , 10 to &lt ; 20 , &gt ; or =20 microg/L ) , and bromoform exposure ( &lt ; 2 , 2 to &lt ; 4 , &gt ; or =4 microg/L ) were modeled at the place of residence for the first trimester of pregnancy .	24 2 241
18288321-4	We included 2,605,226 live births , stillbirths , and terminations with 22,828 cases of congenital anomalies .	
18288321-5	Analyses using fixed- and random-effects models were performed for broadly defined groups of anomalies ( cleft palate/lip , abdominal wall , major cardiac , neural tube , urinary and respiratory defects ) , a more restricted set of anomalies with better ascertainment , and for isolated and multiple anomalies .	1 11 112
18288321-6	Data were adjusted for sex , maternal age , and socioeconomic status .	
18288321-7	RESULTS We found no statistically significant trends across exposure categories for either the broadly defined or more restricted sets of anomalies .	
18288321-8	For the restricted set of anomalies with isolated defects , there were significant ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) excess risks in the high-exposure categories of total THMs for ventricular septal defects [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.43 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.00-2.04 ] and of bromoform for major cardiovascular defects and gastroschisis ( OR = 1.18 ; 95% CI , 1.00-1.39 ; and OR = 1.38 ; 95% CI , 1.00-1.92 , respectively ) .	
18288321-9	CONCLUSION In this large national study we found little evidence for a relationship between THM concentrations in drinking water and risk of congenital anomalies .	24 2 241
19004394-0	The objective of this paper was to document mercury contamination of Amerindian populations living along the Beni River in Bolivia and to examine risk factors related to their lifestyle .	
19004394-1	A cross-sectional survey was performed among 15 communities on the flood plains of the Beni River at the foothills of the Andes .	
19004394-2	Hair mercury content ( H-Hg ) served as a bioindicator of mercury contamination .	1 123 12
19004394-3	Mercury values were available for 556 people .	
19004394-4	Four indicators of lifestyle were analyzed : community accessibility , subsistence activity , fish consumption , and ethnicity ( i.e. , members of the Tacana or Ese Ejja ethnic group ) .	24 2 243
19004394-5	The median of H-Hg was equal to 4.0 microg/g ( 95% CI [ confidence interval ] = 3.6-4.4 ) .	
19004394-6	Approximately 86% of the subjects had H-Hg values lower than 10 microg/g .	
19004394-7	No significant differences existed in H-Hg between adult women and children , nor according to age group .	24 12 1 123 243 2
19004394-8	Subjects belonging to the Ese Ejja ethnic group had higher H-Hg than subjects from the Tacanas ethnic group .	
19004394-9	Communities accessible only by canoe were more frequently contaminated than those accessible by road .	
19004394-10	Subjects who ate at least one serving of fish per day had higher H-Hg , and families who maintained substantial fishing activity were more strongly contaminated .	24 2 243
19004394-11	Contamination levels were found to be low compared with other Amazonian studies .	
19004394-12	The most strongly affected groups , however , were those which preserved a traditional way of life and were the most economically and socially disadvantaged .	
22968349-0	Perchlorate is a widely occurring contaminant , which can competitively inhibit iodide uptake and thus thyroid hormone production .	
22968349-1	The health effects of chronic low dose perchlorate exposure are largely unknown .	
22968349-2	In a community-based study , we compared thyroid function and disease in women with differing likelihoods of prior and current perchlorate exposure .	
22968349-3	Residential blocks were randomly selected from areas : ( 1 ) with potential perchlorate exposure via drinking water ; ( 2 ) with potential exposure to environmental contaminants ; and ( 3 ) neighboring but without such exposures .	24 2 241
22968349-4	Eligibility included having lived in the area for â¥6 months and aged 20-50 years during 1988-1996 ( during documented drinking water well contamination ) .	24 2 241
22968349-5	We interviewed 814 women and collected blood samples ( assayed for thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine ) from 431 interviewed women .	11 1 11122 11123 111 1112
22968349-6	Daily urine samples were assayed for perchlorate and iodide for 178 premenopausal women with blood samples .	1 12 127
22968349-7	We performed multivariable regression analyses comparing thyroid function and disease by residential area and by urinary perchlorate dose adjusted for urinary iodide levels .	1 12 127
22968349-8	Residential location and current perchlorate dose were not associated with thyroid function or disease .	
22968349-9	No persistent effect of perchlorate on thyroid function or disease was found several years after contaminated wells were capped .	
18280542-0	Sieved vacuum bag dust from the homes of 143 children in Detroit was analyzed by mold specific quantitative PCR ( MSQPCR ) and the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index ( ERMIsm ) was calculated for each home .	24 2 242
18280542-1	Children living in these homes were grouped as non-asthmatic ( n=83 ) , moderately asthmatic ( n=28 ) and severely asthmatic ( n=32 ) based on prescription medication usage for their asthma management ( none , occasional and daily , respectively ) .	
18280542-2	The mean ERMI for each group of homes was 6.2 for non-asthmatic , 6.3 for moderately asthmatic and 8.2 for severely asthmatic children .	
18280542-3	The ERMI values in the homes of severely asthmatic children were significantly greater compared to the non-asthmatics ( p=0.04 in Wilcoxon Rank-sum test ) .	
18280542-4	Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus unguis were the primary mold species that distinguished severely asthmatic children's homes and non-asthmatic children's homes ( p&lt;0.05 ; Wilcoxon Rank-sum test ) .	
18280542-5	The determination of the home's ERMI values may aid in prioritizing home remediation efforts , particularly in those children who are at increased risk for asthma exacerbation .	
18414639-0	BACKGROUND Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) has a profound impact on the quality of life of many men .	
18414639-1	Many risk factors are associated with ED , such as aging , sex hormone levels , hypertension , cardiovascular diseases , and diabetes mellitus .	
18414639-2	Arsenic exposure could damage peripheral vessels and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease .	
18414639-3	However , the relationship between arsenic exposure and ED has seldom been evaluated .	
18414639-4	OBJECTIVES In this study we aimed to investigate whether exposure to arsenic enhances the risk of ED .	
18414639-5	METHODS We recruited 177 males &gt;or= 50 years of age through health examinations conducted in three hospitals in Taiwan .	
18414639-6	We used a questionnaire ( International Index of Erectile Function-5 ) to measure the level of erectile function .	1 11 112
18414639-7	Sex hormones , including total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin , were determined by radioimmunoassay .	11 1 11121 11123 111 1112
18414639-8	We used another standardized questionnaire to collect background and behavioral information ( e.g. , cigarette smoking ; alcohol , tea , or coffee drinking ; and physical activity ) .	
18414639-9	RESULTS The prevalence of ED was greater in the arsenic-endemic area ( 83.3% ) than in the non-arsenic-endemic area ( 66.7% ) .	
18414639-10	Subjects with arsenic exposure &gt ; 50 ppb had a significantly higher risk of developing ED than those with exposure &lt;or= 50 ppb , after adjusting for age , cigarette smoking , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 3.4 ] .	2
18414639-11	Results also showed that the risk of developing severe ED was drastically enhanced by arsenic exposure ( OR = 7.5 ) , after adjusting for free testosterone and traditional risk factors of ED .	
18414639-12	CONCLUSIONS Results suggested that chronic arsenic exposure has a negative impact on erectile function .	
19019354-0	OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine optimum biomarkers to detect fetal exposure to environmental pesticides by the simultaneous analysis of maternal ( hair and blood ) and infant ( cord blood , infant hair or meconium ) matrices and to determine if a combination of these biomarkers will further increase the detection rate .	
19019354-1	PATIENTS AND METHODS Pregnant women were prospectively recruited from an agricultural site in the Philippines with substantial use at home and in the farm of the following pesticides : propoxur , cyfluthrin , chlorpyrifos , cypermethrin , pretilachlor , bioallethrin , malathion , diazinon and transfluthrin .	1 122 12 123
19019354-2	Maternal hair and blood were obtained at midgestation and at delivery and infant hair , cord blood and meconium were obtained after birth .	1 122 12 125 123
19019354-3	All samples were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) for the above pesticides and some of their metabolites .	
19019354-4	RESULTS A total of 598 mother/infant dyads were included in this report .	
19019354-5	The highest rates of pesticide exposure were detected in meconium ( 23.2% to propoxur , 2.0% to pretilachlor , 1.7% to cypermethrin , 0.8% to cyfluthrin , 0.7% to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis , p-chlorophenylethane ( DDT ) and 0.3% to malathion and bioallethrin ) and in maternal hair ( 21.6% to propoxur , 14.5% to bioallethrin , 1.3% to malathion , 0.8% to DDT , 0.3% to chlorpyrifos and 0.2% to pretilachlor ) .	
19019354-6	Combined analysis of maternal hair and meconium increased detection rate further to 38.5% for propoxur and to 16.7% for pyrethroids .	
19019354-7	Pesticide metabolites were rarely found in any of the analyzed matrices .	
19019354-8	CONCLUSIONS There is significant exposure of the pregnant woman and her fetus to pesticides , particularly to the home pesticides , propoxur and pyrethroids .	
19019354-9	Analysis of meconium for pesticides was the single most sensitive measure of exposure .	
19019354-10	However , combined analysis of maternal hair and meconium significantly increased the detection rate .	
19019354-11	A major advantage of analyzing maternal hair is that prenatal pesticide exposure in the mother can be detected and intervention measures can be initiated to minimize further exposure of the fetus to pesticides .	
18414638-0	BACKGROUND Arsenic exposure impairs development and can lead to cancer , cardiovascular disease , and diabetes .	
18414638-1	The mechanism underlying these effects remains unknown .	
18414638-2	Primarily because of geologic sources of contamination , drinking-water arsenic levels are above the current recommended maximum contaminant level of 10 microg/L in the northeastern , western , and north central regions of the United States .	
18414638-3	OBJECTIVES We investigated the effects of arsenic exposure , defined by internal biomarkers at levels relevant to the United States and similarly exposed populations , on gene expression .	1 1111 12 111 11
18414638-4	METHODS We conducted separate Affymetrix microarray-based genomewide analyses of expression patterns .	1111 1 111 11
18414638-5	Peripheral blood lymphocyte samples from 21 controls interviewed ( 1999-2002 ) as part of a case-control study in New Hampshire were selected based on high- versus low-level arsenic exposure levels .	
18414638-6	RESULTS The biologic functions of the transcripts that showed statistically significant abundance differences between high- and low-arsenic exposure groups included an overrepresentation of genes involved in defense response , immune function , cell growth , apoptosis , regulation of cell cycle , T-cell receptor signaling pathway , and diabetes .	
18414638-7	Notably , the high-arsenic exposure group exhibited higher levels of several killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors that inhibit natural killer cell activity .	
18414638-8	CONCLUSIONS These findings define biologic changes that occur with chronic arsenic exposure in humans and provide leads and potential targets for understanding and monitoring the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced diseases .	
22999658-0	Identification and systematic assessment of hazardous wastes sites in low and middle-income countries has lagged .	
22999658-1	Hazardous waste problems are especially severe in lower income Asian countries where environmental regulations are non-existent , nonspecific or poorly enforced .	
22999658-2	In these countries extensive unregulated industrial development has created waste sites in densely populated urban areas .	
22999658-3	These sites appear to pose significant risks to public health , and especially to the health of children .	
22999658-4	To assess potential health risks from chemical contamination at hazardous waste sites in Asia , we assessed 679 sites .	
22999658-5	A total of 169 sites in 7 countries were classified as contaminated by lead .	
22999658-6	Eighty-two of these sites contained lead at levels high enough to produce elevated blood lead levels in surrounding populations .	
22999658-7	To estimate the burden of pediatric lead poisoning associated with exposure to lead in soil and water at these 82 lead-contaminated sites , we used standard toxicokinetic models that relate levels of lead in soil and water to blood lead levels in children .	24 245 2 241 21
22999658-8	We calculated blood lead levels , and we quantified losses of intelligence ( reductions in IQ scores ) that were attributable to lead exposure at these sites .	11 1 2 21 112
22999658-9	We found that 189,725 children in the 7 countries are at risk of diminished intelligence as a consequence of exposure to elevated levels of lead in water and soil at hazardous waste sites .	245 24 2 241
22999658-10	Depending on choice of model , these decrements ranged from 4.94 to 14.96 IQ points .	
22999658-11	Given the restricted scope of this survey and the conservative estimation procedures employed , this number is almost certainly an underestimate of the full burden of disease .	
22999658-12	Exposure to toxic chemicals from hazardous waste sites is an important and heretofore insufficiently examined contributor to the Global Burden of Disease .	
18264790-0	The study was undertaken to examine the nature of particulate chalk dust settled on classroom floor during traditional teaching with dusting and non-dusting chalks on two types of boards viz. rough and smooth .	24 2 242
18264790-1	Settling chalk particles were collected for 30 min during teaching in glass Petri plates placed in classrooms within 3 m distance from the teaching boards .	24 2 242
18264790-2	Particle size distribution , scanning electron microscopic images of chalk dusts and compressive strength of two types of chalks were tested and evaluated .	
18264790-3	Results showed that a larger proportion of dusts generated from anti-dusting chalks were of &lt;4.5 and &lt;2.5 microm size on both smooth and rough boards , as compared to dusting chalks .	
18264790-4	Non-dusting chalks , on an average , produced about 56% and 62% ( by volume ) of &lt;4.5 microm ( respirable ) diameter , on rough and smooth boards , respectively , while the corresponding values for dusting chalks were 36% and 45% .	
18264790-5	Also , on an average , 83% and 94% ( by volume ) of the particles were &lt;11 microm ( thoracic ) in case of non-dusting chalks against 61% and 72% for dusting chalks on rough and smooth boards , respectively .	
18264790-6	Interestingly , taking into account the mass of chalk dust produced per unit time , which was higher in dusting chalks than non dusting chalks , the former was actually producing higher amount of PM &lt;4.5 and &lt;11 particles from both types of boards .	24 2 242
18264790-7	Scanning electron microscope images revealed that chalk particles had random shape , although in dusting chalks prevalence of elongated particles was observed , apparently due to the longitudinal breaking of the chalks during writing , which was confirmed during compressive strength testing .	
18264790-8	We could conclude that dusting chalks could be potentially more harmful than anti dusting chalks , as they produced higher amount of potentially dangerous PM 4.5 and PM 11 .	
18414634-0	BACKGROUND Individual variability in arsenic metabolism may underlie individual susceptibility toward arsenic-induced skin lesions and skin cancer .	
18414634-1	Metabolism of arsenic proceeds through sequential reduction and oxidative methylation being mediated by the following genes : purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) , arsenic ( +3 ) methyltransferase ( As3MT ) , glutathione S-transferase omega 1 ( GSTO1 ) , and omega 2 ( GSTO2 ) .	
18414634-2	PNP functions as arsenate reductase ; As3MT methylates inorganic arsenic and its metabolites ; and both GSTO1 and GSTO2 reduce the metabolites .	
18414634-3	Alteration in functions of these gene products may lead to arsenic-specific disease manifestations .	
18414634-4	OBJECTIVES To find any probable association between arsenicism and the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) of the above-mentioned arsenic-metabolizing genes , we screened all the exons in those genes in an arsenic-exposed population .	
18414634-5	METHODS Using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis , we screened the exons in 25 cases ( individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions ) and 25 controls ( individuals without arsenic-induced skin lesions ) , both groups drinking similar arsenic-contaminated water .	1 11 112
18414634-6	The exonic SNPs identified were further genotyped in a total of 428 genetically unrelated individuals ( 229 cases and 199 controls ) for association study .	
18414634-7	RESULTS Among four candidate genes , PNP , As3MT , GSTO1 , and GSTO2 , we found that distribution of three exonic polymorphisms , His20His , Gly51Ser , and Pro57Pro of PNP , was associated with arsenicism .	
18414634-8	Genotypes having the minor alleles were significantly overrepresented in the case group : odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.69 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.08-2.66 ] for His20His ; OR = 1.66 [ 95% CI , 1.04-2.64 ] for Gly51Ser ; and OR = 1.67 [ 95% CI , 1.05-2.66 ] for Pro57Pro .	
18414634-9	CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that the three PNP variants render individuals susceptible toward developing arsenic-induced skin lesions .	
23060364-0	BACKGROUND Exposure to air pollution has been linked to the exacerbation of respiratory diseases .	
23060364-1	The Air Quality Health Index ( AQHI ) , developed in Canada , is a new health risk scale for reporting air quality and advising risk reduction actions .	
23060364-2	OBJECTIVE We used the AQHI to estimate the impact of air quality on asthma morbidity , adjusting for potential confounders .	
23060364-3	METHODS Daily air pollutant measures were obtained from 14 regional monitoring stations in Ontario .	2 231 23
23060364-4	Daily counts of asthma-attributed hospitalizations , emergency department ( ED ) visits , and outpatient visits were obtained from a provincial registry of 1.5 million patients with asthma .	
23060364-5	Poisson regression was used to estimate health services rate ratios ( RRs ) as a measure of association between the AQHI or individual pollutants and health services use .	2 231 23
23060364-6	We adjusted for age , sex , season , year , and region of residence .	
23060364-7	RESULTS The AQHI values were significantly associated with increased use of asthma health services on the same day and on the 2 following days , depending on the specific outcome assessed .	
23060364-8	A 1-unit increase in the AQHI was associated with a 5.6% increase in asthma outpatient visits ( RR = 1.056 ; 95% CI : 1.053 , 1.058 ) and a 2.1% increase in the rate of hospitalization ( RR = 1.021 ; 95% CI : 1.014 , 1.028 ) on the same day and with a 1.3% increase in the rate of ED visits ( RR = 1.013 ; 95% CI : 1.010 , 1.017 ) after a 2-day lag .	
23060364-9	CONCLUSIONS The AQHI values were significantly associated with the use of asthma-related health services .	
23060364-10	Timely AQHI health risk advisories with integrated risk reduction messages may reduce morbidity associated with air pollution in patients with asthma .	
19037006-0	The authors evaluated the association of prenatal arsenic exposure with size at birth ( birth weight , birth length , head and chest circumferences ) .	
19037006-1	This prospective cohort study , based on 1,578 mother-infant pairs , was conducted in Matlab , Bangladesh , in 2002-2003 .	
19037006-2	Arsenic exposure was assessed by analysis of arsenic in urine collected at around gestational weeks 8 and 30 .	1 12 127
19037006-3	The association of arsenic exposure with size at birth was assessed by linear regression analyses .	
19037006-4	In analysis over the full range of exposure ( 6-978 microg/L ) , no dose-effect association was found with birth size .	1 11 112
19037006-5	However , significant negative dose effects were found with birth weight and head and chest circumferences at a low level of arsenic exposure ( &lt;100 microg/L in urine ) .	1 11 112
19037006-6	In this range of exposure , birth weight decreased by 1.68 ( standard error ( SE ) , 0.62 ) g for each 1-microg/L increase of arsenic in urine .	
19037006-7	For head and chest circumferences , the corresponding reductions were 0.05 ( SE , 0.03 ) mm and 0.14 ( SE , 0.03 ) mm per 1 microg/L , respectively .	
19037006-8	No further negative effects were shown at higher levels of arsenic exposure .	
19037006-9	The indicated negative effect on birth size at a low level of arsenic exposure warrants further investigation .	
18414515-0	Investigations into human exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA ) have , for the most part , assessed intake based on food consumption estimates combined with measurements or estimates of BPA in foods .	
18414515-1	In this study , nationally representative data on urinary levels of BPA in the United States ( US ) from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) were used to estimate daily intake of BPA , assuming steady-state excretion .	1 2 12 21 127
18414515-2	Distributions of intakes for the US population were determined for ( i ) all NHANES participants with urinary BPA data ; ( ii ) participants by the following age groups : 6-11 years , 12-19 years , 20-39 years , 40-59 years , and 60+ years ; and ( iii ) participants by gender .	1 12 127
18414515-3	On the basis of the NHANES urinary BPA data and the assumptions described in this paper , daily BPA intakes for male participants are statistically significantly higher than for female participants , and there are statistically significant differences in daily BPA intakes according to age groups , with the oldest group having the lowest estimated intakes .	
18414515-4	Median intake was approximately three orders of magnitude below health-based guidance values of 50 microg/kg-day .	
23109040-0	BACKGROUND We evaluated the effectiveness of workplace changes to prevent indium lung disease , using 2002-2010 surveillance data collected by an indium-tin oxide production facility .	
23109040-1	METHODS We assessed pulmonary function using lower limits of normal .	
23109040-2	Blood indium concentration and personal air sampling data were used to estimate exposure .	12 23 1 122 2 233
23109040-3	RESULTS Abnormalities were uncommon at hire .	
23109040-4	After hire , prevalence of spirometric restriction was 31% ( n = 14/45 ) , about fourfold higher than expected .	1 11 112
23109040-5	Excessive decline in FEV1 was elevated at 29% ( n = 12/41 ) .	1 11 112
23109040-6	Half ( n = 21/42 ) had blood indium â¥5 Âµg/l .	1 122 12
23109040-7	More recent hires had fewer abnormalities .	
23109040-8	There was a suggestion that abnormalities were more common among workers with blood indium â¥5 Âµg/l , but otherwise an exposure-response relationship was not evident .	12 23 1 122 2 233
23109040-9	Peak dust concentrations were obscured by time averaging .	
23109040-10	CONCLUSIONS Evolving lung function abnormalities consistent with subclinical indium lung disease appeared common and merit systematic investigation .	
23109040-11	Traditional measures of exposure and response were not illustrative , suggesting fresh approaches will be needed .	
23109040-12	Workplace changes seemed to have had a positive though incomplete impact ; novel preventive interventions are warranted .	
19041090-0	Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) have been suspected for some time of having adverse effects on neuropsychological functioning in humans .	
19041090-1	While there is evidence of slowing of cognitive function in children associated with exposure to PCBs , the evidence of comparable effects on adults is far less well understood .	
19041090-2	We report here on the neuropsychological evaluation of 277 Native American adults , ranging in age from 18 to 79 , who were exposed to PCBs by way of environmental contamination in the St. Lawrence region of upstate New York .	1 11 112
19041090-3	PCB body burden was estimated by 101 PCB congeners and neuropsychological functioning was assessed by a battery of 18 tests .	1 12
19041090-4	Spline regression models were fitted to the latent variables of memory , motor function , and higher-order executive functioning .	1 11 112
19041090-5	After adjusting for age , gender , and education the analyses revealed a threshold effect of PCBs at approximately 2 ppb .	
19041090-6	An age-by-PCB interaction effect was also observed for several variables which suggests that the threshold effect was largely confined to the age range of 40-79 and was not observable in the 18-40-year-old group .	
19041090-7	Implications of these results are discussed in comparison to previously published similar work with adults and in terms of its potential clinical meaningfulness .	
18192277-0	The Seveso accident in 1976 caused a large , populated area north of Milan , Italy , to be contaminated by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) .	
18192277-1	In this study , the authors followed up the exposed population for chronic effects ; this paper reports the results of the mortality follow-up extension for 1997-2001 .	
18192277-2	The study cohort includes 278,108 subjects resident at the time of the accident or immigrating/born in the 10 years thereafter in three contaminated zones with decreasing TCDD soil levels ( zone A , very high ; zone B , high ; zone R , low ) and in a reference territory comprising surrounding , noncontaminated municipalities .	24 245 2
18192277-3	Vital status and cause-of-death ascertainment were 99% complete .	
18192277-4	Adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using Poisson regression .	
18192277-5	Results confirmed previous findings of excesses of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue neoplasms in zones A ( six deaths ; rate ratio = 2.23 , 95% confidence interval : 1.00 , 4.97 ) and B ( 28 deaths ; rate ratio = 1.59 , 95% confidence interval : 1.09 , 2.33 ) .	
18192277-6	These zones also showed increased mortality from circulatory diseases in the first years after the accident , from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and from diabetes mellitus among females .	
18192277-7	A toxic and carcinogenic risk to humans after high TCDD exposure is supported by the results of this study .	
23111867-0	Ambient aerosol concentrations along the roadside of metropolitan cities of Pakistan were measured using a Grimm 1.109 dust monitor .	2 23
23111867-1	Considering the high ambient aerosol concentrations , regional lung deposition of aerosol particles in the human respiratory tract was calculated to assess extent of exposure .	2 232 23
23111867-2	Lung deposition was computed in terms of mass concentration and the associated surface area for 12 male traffic wardens using the latest version of the stochastic lung deposition code Inhalation , Deposition , and Exhalation of Aerosols in the Lung .	
23111867-3	The results have revealed 4 to 10 times higher concentrations than recommended by WHO guidelines .	
23111867-4	The deposition results derived from the model disclose that extrathoracic deposition is in the range of 22 to 28 % with total lung deposition ranging from 40 to 44 % for the scanned particle window of 0.25-10 Î¼m .	
23111867-5	Considering an average 8-h shift per day and an average breathing rate of 1.3 m(3) h(-1) , it is approximated that in a worker , up to 1.6 mg of inhalable particle mass can deposit per day .	2 232 23
18398444-0	The exposure of pregnant women and young children to environmental pollutants is an ongoing concern of state and local public health departments .	
18398444-1	Of primary concern is the exposure to lead in lead-based paints , methyl mercury in contaminated fish and cadmium present at mining sites .	
18398444-2	The feasibility , utility and methodology of using blood spot cards collected for new born health screening purposes was studied for use in conducting routine state-wide surveillance of blood lead , mercury and cadmium levels in infants .	1 122 12
18398444-3	Homogeneity of different lots of blank filter paper was examined .	
18398444-4	Mass measurements ( weights ) of filter paper punches were taken across three different lots of filter paper .	
18398444-5	Statistical analysis of the data was performed using one-way ANOVA , which indicated no significant difference in the means of all three lots , but high variances were noted .	
18398444-6	The three metals were examined in three different lots of filter papers purchased from the manufacturer .	
18398444-7	The lots had measurable amounts of cadmium and lead , but not mercury .	
18398444-8	Lead spike values were observed for roughly about 7% of the blank samples , indicating heterogeneous distribution of this metal .	
18398444-9	Statistical analysis of the data was also performed using a two-way ANOVA calculation with Tukey's pairwise comparisons .	
18398444-10	The results found that total mean metal loadings across the three lots were different .	
18398444-11	The concentration of the metals can be different from each other and the concentration of any one metal can differ across lots .	
18398444-12	Stability at different concentrations of the heavy metals in blood spotted onto filter paper with time and storage conditions was examined .	1 122 12
18398444-13	Results indicate acceptable performance for at least 8.5 months for lead ( near CDC's concern level ) and for mercury ( near NRC's concern level ) .	
18398444-14	The filter paper and blood spots were analyzed for metals using an acid extraction , followed by analysis using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer ( ICP-MS ) .	1 122 12
18398444-15	Blood spot cards were studied from four different states across the Rocky Mountain region .	
18398444-16	Internal blank punches adjacent to the blood spot and actual dried spot punches from the same card were analyzed simultaneously .	
18398444-17	The blank punch indicated the amount of contamination present in the blood spot sample .	1 122 12
18398444-18	Statistical analysis of the data was performed using MANOVA followed by calculations for each metal separately .	
18398444-19	This method was found to be suitable for assessing maternal exposure to lead and mercury using residual newborn screening specimens .	
18398444-20	Additional research into the applicability for cadmium is needed .	
18398444-21	Because of the intrinsic problem of contamination from the skin surface of capillary blood samples or other internal or extraneous sources , automatic re-analysis of elevated results assures minimal false positives are reported .	
23177781-0	Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of perinatal mortality and is associated with long-term adverse health consequences for surviving infants .	
23177781-1	Preterm birth rates are rising worldwide , and no effective means for prevention currently exists .	
23177781-2	Air pollution exposure may be a significant cause of prematurity , but many published studies lack the individual , clinical data needed to elucidate possible biological mechanisms mediating these epidemiological associations .	2 23
23177781-3	This paper presents the design of a prospective study now underway to evaluate those mechanisms in a cohort of pregnant women residing in Mexico City .	
23177781-4	We address how air quality may act together with other factors to induce systemic inflammation and influence the duration of pregnancy .	
23177781-5	Data collection includes : biomarkers relevant to inflammation in cervico-vaginal exudate and peripheral blood , along with full clinical information , pro-inflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms and air pollution data to evaluate spatial and temporal variability in air pollution exposure .	11 1 2 231 23
23177781-6	Samples are collected on a monthly basis and participants are followed for the duration of pregnancy .	
23177781-7	The data will be used to evaluate whether ambient air pollution is associated with preterm birth , controlling for other risk factors .	2 23
23177781-8	We will evaluate which time windows during pregnancy are most influential in the air pollution and preterm birth association .	11 23 1 2 112 231
23177781-9	In addition , the epidemiological study will be complemented with a parallel toxicology invitro study , in which monocytic cells will be exposed to air particle samples to evaluate the expression of biomarkers of inflammation .	
18063593-0	The authors tested the hypothesis that the birth prevalence of gastroschisis is positively associated with use of recreational drugs in early pregnancy .	24 11 23 1 244 2 112 232
18063593-1	A matched case-control study was carried out in three regions of the United Kingdom over the period January 2001 through August 2003 .	
18063593-2	For each case , three liveborn controls were matched by initial intended place of delivery , region , and maternal age .	
18063593-3	Maternal hair analysis provided independent verification of recreational drug use .	24 12 1 244 123 2
18063593-4	Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mutually adjusted odds ratios .	
18063593-5	Estimates were revised using data from hair analysis .	1 123 12
18063593-6	Statistically significant adjusted odds ratios for gastroschisis were associated with first-trimester use of 1 ) any recreational drug ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 2.2 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.2 , 4.3 ) and 2 ) vasoconstrictive recreational drugs ( defined as cocaine , amphetamines , and ecstasy ) ( OR = 3.3 , 95% CI : 1.0 , 10.5 ) .	24 244 2
18063593-7	Other significant exposures included aspirin use ( OR = 20.4 , 95% CI : 2.2 , 191.5 ) , cigarette smoking ( OR = 1.7 , 95% CI : 1.1 , 2.6 ) , and prior history of gynecologic infection/disease ( OR = 2.6 , 95% CI : 1.2 , 5.6 ) .	24 244 2 232 23
18063593-8	Recreational drug use is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis and is one of a constellation of potentially preventable exposures which include cigarette smoking , aspirin use , and history of gynecologic infection/disease .	24 244 2 232 23
18063593-9	Maternal hair analysis proved an acceptable and valuable method of independently verifying recreational drug use .	
23208275-0	A number of studies have linked exposure to long-term outdoor air pollution with cardiopulmonary disease ; however , the evidence for stroke is limited .	
23208275-1	Furthermore , evidence with the risk for lung cancer ( LC ) is still inconsistent .	
23208275-2	We , therefore , evaluated the association between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and cause-specific mortality .	2 23
23208275-3	Individual data were extracted from participants of an ongoing cohort study in Shizuoka , Japan .	
23208275-4	A total of 14,001 elderly residents completed questionnaires and were followed from December 1999 to January 2009 .	
23208275-5	Annual individual nitrogen dioxide ( NO(2) ) exposure data , as an index for traffic-related exposure , were modeled using a Land Use Regression model and assigned to the participants .	2 231 23
23208275-6	We then estimated the adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ) and their confidence intervals ( CIs ) associated with a 10 Î¼g/m(3) elevation in NO(2) for all-cause or cause-specific mortality using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models .	
23208275-7	We found positive associations of NO(2) levels with all-cause ( HR=1.12 , 95% CI : 1.07-1.18 ) , cardiopulmonary disease ( HR=1.22 , 95% CI : 1.15-1.30 ) , and LC mortality ( HR=1.20 , 95% CI : 1.03-1.40 ) .	
23208275-8	Among cardiopulmonary disease mortality , not only the risk for ischemic heart disease ( HR=1.27 , 95% CI : 1.11-1.47 ) but also the risks for stroke were elevated : intracerebral hemorrhage ( HR=1.28 , 95% CI : 1.05-1.57 ) and ischemic stroke ( HR=1.20 , 95% CI : 1.04-1.39 ) .	
23208275-9	The present study supports the existing evidence that long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution increases the risk of cardiopulmonary as well as LC mortality , and provides additional evidence for adverse effects on intracerebral hemorrhage as well as ischemic stroke .	
18021762-0	Although much is known about the incidence and burden of preterm birth , its biological mechanisms are not well understood .	
18021762-1	While several studies have suggested that high levels of air pollution or exposure to particular climatic factors may be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth , other studies do not support such an association .	
18021762-2	To determine whether exposure to various environmental factors place a large London-based population at higher risk for preterm birth , we analyzed 482,568 births that occurred between 1988 and 2000 from the St. Mary's Maternity Information System database .	
18021762-3	Using an ecological study design , any short-term associations between preterm birth and various environmental factors were investigated using time-series regression techniques .	1 11 112
18021762-4	Environmental exposures included air pollution ( ambient ozone and PM(10) ) and climatic factors ( temperature , rainfall , sunshine , relative humidity , barometric pressure , and largest drop in barometric pressure ) .	2 23
18021762-5	In addition to exposure on the day of birth , cumulative exposure up to 1 week before birth was investigated .	2 231 23
18021762-6	The risk of preterm birth did not increase with exposure to the levels of ambient air pollution or meteorological factors experienced by this population .	2 231 23
18021762-7	Cumulative exposure from 0 to 6 days before birth also did not show any significant effect on the risk of preterm birth .	
18021762-8	This large study , covering 13 years , suggests that there is no association between preterm births and recent exposure to ambient air pollution or recent changes in the weather .	2 23
19059588-0	Cadmium is a widespread environmental pollutant , which is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis .	
19059588-1	It has been proposed that cadmium's toxic effect on bone is exerted via impaired activation of vitamin D , secondary to the kidney effects .	
19059588-2	To test this , we assessed the association of cadmium-induced bone and kidney effects with serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25(OH)(2)D ) ; measured by enzyme immunoassay .	11 1 1112 111 11121
19059588-3	For the assessment , we selected 85 postmenopausal women , based on low ( 0.14-0.39 microg/L ) or high ( 0.66-2.1 microg/L ) urinary cadmium , within a cross-sectional population-based women's health survey in Southern Sweden .	1 12 127
19059588-4	We also measured 25-hydroxy vitamin D , cadmium in blood , bone mineral density and several markers of bone remodeling and kidney effects .	11 12 1 11121 122 1112 111 112
19059588-5	Although there were clear differences in both kidney and bone effect markers between women with low and high cadmium exposure , the 1,25(OH)(2)D concentrations were not significantly different ( median , 111 pmol/L ( 5-95th percentile , 67-170 pmol/L ) in low- and 125 pmol/L ( 66-200 pmol/L ) in high-cadmium groups ; p=0.08 ) .	11 1
19059588-6	Also , there was no association between 1,25(OH)(2)D and markers of bone or kidney effects .	
19059588-7	It is concluded that the low levels of cadmium exposure present in the studied women , although high enough to be associated with lower bone mineral density and increased bone resorption , were not associated with lower serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)(2)D .	
19059588-8	Hence , decreased circulating levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D are unlikely to be the proposed link between cadmium-induced effects on kidney and bone .	
18335109-0	BACKGROUND Mercury is nephrotoxic and dental amalgam is a source of mercury exposure .	
18335109-1	METHODS Children 6-10 years of age ( n = 534 ) with two or more posterior teeth with caries but no prior amalgam restorations , were randomized to one of two treatments--amalgam or resin composite ( white fillings)--used for caries treatment during 5 years of follow-up .	1 12 127
18335109-2	The primary outcome was change in IQ , but important secondary outcomes were effects on markers of glomerular and tubular kidney function : urinary excretion of albumin , alpha-1-microglobulin ( A1M ) , gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( gamma-GT ) , and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) .	11 1 11123 111 112 1112
18335109-3	These markers were measured on several occasions during the trial , together with urinary mercury and covariates .	1 12 127
18335109-4	We evaluated the results using repeated-measures analyses .	
18335109-5	RESULTS There were no significant differences between treatment groups in average levels of renal biomarkers , nor significant effects of number of dental amalgams on these markers .	11 24 1 244 2 111
18335109-6	There was , however , a significantly increased prevalence of microalbuminuria ( MA ) among children in the amalgam group in years 3-5 ( adjusted odds ratio 1.8 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.1-2.9 ) .	11 24 1 244 11123 111 2 1112
18335109-7	Most of these cases are likely to be temporary MA , but 10 children in the amalgam group had MA in both years 3 and 5 , versus 2 children in the composite group ( p = 0.04 ) .	
18335109-8	There were no differences in the occurrence of high levels of renal tubular markers ( A1M , gamma-GT , or NAG ) .	1 11 111
18335109-9	CONCLUSIONS The increase in MA may be a random finding , but should be tested further .	
18335109-10	The results did not support recent findings in an observational study of an effect of low-level mercury on tubular biomarkers in children .	
23246666-0	In this study , the relationships between high water fluoride exposure and essential hypertension as well as plasma ET-1 levels were investigated .	
23246666-1	A total of 487 residents aged 40 to 75 were randomly recruited from eight villages in Zhaozhou County from Heilongjiang Province in China and were divided into 4 groups according to the concentrations of fluoride in their water .	24 2 241
23246666-2	Consumption levels of drinking water fluoride for normal , mild , moderate , and high exposure groups were 0.84Â±0.26 mg/L , 1.55Â±0.22 mg/L , 2.49Â±0.30 mg/L , and 4.06Â±1.15 mg/L , respectively .	24 2 241
23246666-3	The prevalence of hypertension in each group was 20.16% , 24.54% , 32.30% , and 49.23% , respectively .	1 11 112
23246666-4	There were significant differences between all the groups ; namely , with the increase in water fluoride concentrations , the risk of essential hypertension in adults grows in a concentration-dependent manner .	
23246666-5	Significant differences were observed in the plasma ET-1 levels between the different groups ( P&lt;0.0001 ) .	
23246666-6	In the multivariable logistic regression model , high water fluoride concentrations ( F(-)â¥3.01 mg/L , OR(4/1)=2.84 ) , age ( OR(3/1)=2.63 ) , and BMI ( OR(2/1)=2.40 , OR(3/1)=6.03 ) were closely associated with essential hypertension .	
23246666-7	In other words , the study not only confirmed the relationship between excess fluoride intake and essential hypertension in adults , but it also demonstrated that high levels of fluoride exposure in drinking water could increase plasma ET-1 levels in subjects living in fluoride endemic areas .	24 2 241
17935757-0	This work presents the results of a research concerning the copper content in different types of deciduous teeth ( incisor , canine , molar ) of boys and girls living in the Upper Silesian Industry Region ( Southern Poland ) .	1 12 125
17935757-1	The average copper concentration in deciduous teeth was 9.92 microg/g and was significantly higher in the deciduous teeth of boys ( 12.24 microg/g ) in comparison to the deciduous teeth of girls ( 8.60 microg/g ) .	1 12 125
17935757-2	The concentration of copper was statistically variable depending on the type of tooth ( incisor , canine , molar ) .	
17935757-3	The results of the correlation analysis and cluster analysis indicate mainly the participation of lead , iron , manganese and chromium ions in the formation of copper content in hard tissue of deciduous teeth .	1 12 125
19079713-0	BACKGROUND Persistent pollutants , such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , affect endocrine function .	
19079713-1	Human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , which are similar in structure to PCBs , has increased recently , but health effects have not been well studied .	
19079713-2	OBJECTIVES Our goal in this study was to determine whether PBDE body burdens are related to thyroid and steroid hormone levels , thyroid antibodies , and thyroid disease in a cohort of frequent and infrequent adult male sport fish consumers .	
19079713-3	METHODS We tested serum from 405 adult males for PBDE congeners , PCB congeners , testosterone , sex-hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) , SHBG-bound testosterone , thyroglobulin antibodies , and the thyroid hormones thyroxine ( T(4) ) , triiodothyronine ( T(3) ) , thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , and T(4)-binding globulin ( TBG ) .	11 12 11122 1 11121 122 11123 111 1112
19079713-4	We collected data on demographics , fish consumption , medical diseases , and medication use .	24 2 243
19079713-5	RESULTS The median sum of PBDEs was 38 ng/g lipid .	
19079713-6	In 308 men without thyroid disease or diabetes , PBDEs were positively related to measures of T(4) and reverse T(3) and inversely related to total T(3) and TSH .	
19079713-7	PBDEs were positively related to the percentage of T(4) bound to albumin , and inversely related to the percentage of T(4) bound to TBG .	
19079713-8	Associations of BDE congeners with hormones varied .	
19079713-9	BDE-47 was positively associated with testosterone levels .	
19079713-10	Participants with PBDEs over the 95th percentile were more likely to have thyroglobulin antibodies , although high PBDE exposure was not associated with thyroid disease .	
19079713-11	PBDE effects were independent of PCB exposure and sport fish consumption .	
19079713-12	CONCLUSIONS PBDE exposure , at levels comparable with those of the general U.S. population , was associated with increased thyroglobulin antibodies and increased T(4) in adult males .	
17928817-0	In May 2004 , two groundwater wells in Dinwiddie County , Virginia were found to have natural uranium levels either at or above the EPA recommended limit of 30 microg/l .	
17928817-1	As a result , a stop drinking water advisory was issued until a water treatment system could be installed to remove the uranium .	
17928817-2	In response to residents ' concerns , and uncertainty of exposures , affected individuals were asked to participate in a voluntary epidemiological investigation of uranium uptake and 1-year uranium retention study .	
17928817-3	This study had two primary objectives : quantification of the uranium load on the participants , as expressed by their urine uranium concentration , and retention after 1 year of no exposure .	1 12 127
17928817-4	A first-morning void urine specimen , along with survey information , was collected from 156 participants in May 2004 , with a second collection occurring 12 months later of 91 participants .	1 12 127
17928817-5	The samples were analyzed for uranium by ICP/MS , pH , creatinine by the Jaffe method , and RBP by LIA after both collections .	
17928817-6	A reduction of one order of magnitude for the geometric mean urine uranium concentration was observed , from 0.100 microg/g creatinine to 0.011 microg/g creatinine in 1 year .	
17928817-7	Comparatively , NHANES has reported that the geometric mean for all participants , ages 6 years and older , is 0.008 microg/g creatinine , with the 95th percentile being 0.040 microg/g creatinine .	
17928817-8	None of the second round specimens showed a urine uranium concentration higher than baseline for an individual .	
18335097-0	BACKGROUND The interindividual variation in metabolism of inorganic arsenic ( iAs ) , involving methylation via one-carbon metabolism , has been well documented , but the reasons remain unclear .	
18335097-1	OBJECTIVES In this population-based study we aimed to elucidate the effect of nutrition on As methylation among women in Matlab , Bangladesh , where people are chronically exposed to iAs via drinking water .	
18335097-2	METHODS We studied effects of macronutrient status using body mass index ( BMI ) among 442 women in early pregnancy ( gestational week 8 ) , and effects of micronutrient status ( plasma folate , vitamin B12 , zinc , ferritin , and selenium ) among 753 women at gestational week 14 .	1 12 127
18335097-3	Arsenic metabolites in urine were measured by HPLC combined with hydride generation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .	1 12 127
18335097-4	RESULTS The median concentration of As in urine was 97 microg/L ( range , 5-1,216 microg/L , adjusted by specific gravity ) .	
18335097-5	The average proportions of iAs , monomethylarsonic acid , and dimethylarsinic acid in urine in gestational week 8 were 15% , 11% , and 74% , respectively .	
18335097-6	Thus , the women had efficient As methylation in spite of being poorly nourished ( one-third had BMIs &lt ; 18.5 kg/m2 ) and having elevated As exposure , both of which are known to decrease As methylation .	
18335097-7	The metabolism of iAs was only marginally influenced by micronutrient status , probably because women , especially in pregnancy and with low folate intake , have an efficient betaine-mediated remethylation of homocysteine , which is essential for an efficient As methylation .	
18335097-8	CONCLUSIONS In spite of the high As exposure and prevalent malnutrition , overall As methylation in women in early pregnancy was remarkably efficient .	
18335097-9	The As exposure level had the greatest impact on As methylation among the studied factors .	
19091374-0	Environmental policies in Mexico have contributed to the reduction in the production or use of some persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) and metals .	
19091374-1	However , monitoring of POPs concentrations in humans living in hot spots is lacking .	
19091374-2	Therefore , the objective of this study was to conduct a screening for POPs and metals first in Mexican children living in high-risk areas .	
19091374-3	During the year 2004 , we analyzed a total of 229 healthy children ( aged 6-12 years old ) who resided in communities located in nine Mexican states .	
19091374-4	Organochlorine insecticides , PCBs and metals were quantified in plasma and urine samples .	1 122 12 127
19091374-5	We detected p'p-DDE in all the children ; moreover , p'p-DDT , lindane and hexachlorobenzene were detected respectively in 14% , 85% and 10% of the children studied .	1 122 12 127
19091374-6	Measurable levels of PCBs were recorded in only one community , where six of 14 PCB congeners assayed were detected ( numbers 52 , 118 , 138 , 153 , 170 and 180 ) .	
19091374-7	All the children had detectable levels of lead in their blood ( mean level , 4.6 microg dL(-1) ) ; furthermore , 57% of the children studied had levels higher than 5.0 microg/dL .	1 122 12
19091374-8	The mean level of urinary arsenic ( UAs ) for all the children was 22.35 microg g(-1) creatinine and 15% of those children had concentrations of UAs above 50 microg g(-1) creatinine .	1 12 127
19091374-9	For cadmium , the mean urinary level was 0.78 microg g(-1) creatinine , and only one percent of the children had values above 2.0 microg g(-1) creatinine .	1 12 127
19091374-10	The results cannot be generalized since the communities selected are not representative of the Mexican population ; however , they indicate that Mexican children are exposed to chemicals and some at risk levels .	
23290947-0	Glycol ethers are a class of semi-volatile substances used as solvents in a variety of consumer products like cleaning agents , paints , cosmetics as well as chemical intermediates .	
23290947-1	We determined 11 metabolites of ethylene and propylene glycol ethers in 44 urine samples of German residents ( background level study ) and in urine samples of individuals after exposure to glycol ethers during cleaning activities ( exposure study ) .	24 12 1 244 2 127
23290947-2	In the study on the background exposure , methoxyacetic acid and phenoxyacetic acid ( PhAA ) could be detected in each urine sample with median ( 95th percentile ) values of 0.11 mgL(-1) ( 0.30 mgL(-1) ) and 0.80 mgL(-1) ( 23.6 mgL(-1) ) , respectively .	
23290947-3	The other metabolites were found in a limited number of samples or in none .	
23290947-4	In the exposure study , 5-8 rooms were cleaned with a cleaner containing ethylene glycol monobutyl ether ( EGBE ) , propylene glycol monobutyl ether ( PGBE ) , or ethylene glycol monopropyl ether ( EGPE ) .	24 244 2
23290947-5	During cleaning the mean levels in the indoor air were 7.5 mgm(-3) ( EGBE ) , 3.0 mgm(-3) ( PGBE ) , and 3.3 mgm(-3) ( EGPE ) , respectively .	2 232 23
23290947-6	The related metabolite levels analysed in the urine of the residents of the rooms at the day of cleaning were 2.4 mgL(-1) for butoxyacetic acid , 0.06 mgL(-1) for 2-butoxypropionic acid , and 2.3 mgL(-1) for n-propoxyacetic acid .	1 12 127
23290947-7	Overall , our study indicates that the exposure of the population to glycol ethers is generally low , with the exception of PhAA .	
23290947-8	Moreover , the results of the cleaning scenarios demonstrate that the use of indoor cleaning agents containing glycol ethers can lead to a detectable internal exposure of residents .	24 244 2
18321481-0	In many developing countries , mercury is used to extract gold from ore in small-scale mining areas .	
18321481-1	Exposure through mercury in these small-scale mining communities is a serious health hazard , especially to the children living and working there .	
18321481-2	Many children begin working with immediate contact to mercury from the very early age of seven .	
18321481-3	In Indonesia and Zimbabwe , 166 children were clinically examined for mercury .	1 122 12 127 123
18321481-4	The mercury concentration in the blood , urine , and hair was analyzed .	1 122 12 127 123
18321481-5	Compared to the control groups , the exposed children showed typical symptoms of mercury intoxication , such as ataxia .	11 1 112
18321481-6	The children working with mercury had high levels of this substance in the various biomonitors .	1 12 122 123 127
18321481-7	The exposure derives mainly from the liquid mercury used to bind gold , forming an amalgam .	
18321481-8	The amalgam is heated and the smelting amalgam releases mercury vapor plus the wanted gold .	
18321481-9	Mercury vapor in contrast to liquid mercury is highly toxic .	
18321481-10	This elemental , vaporized mercury is the main form of exposure .	
18321481-11	Since in over 50 countries children live in small-scale gold mining areas and are exposed in a similar way to mercury , immediate action is needed to reduce this severe chemical health hazard for children .	
18321481-12	Child labor with hazardous substances such as mercury must be stopped .	
23321859-0	Underlying mechanisms by which air pollutants adversely affect human health remain poorly understood .	
23321859-1	Oxidative stress has been considered as a potential mechanism that may promote lipid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species , leading to the formation of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) that is excreted in biofluids ( e.g. , urine and exhaled breath condensate ( EBC) ) .	11 12 1 11122 1112 111 1114 127 125
23321859-2	A panel study was conducted to examine whether concentrations of MDA in EBC and urine were associated , respectively , with changes in air pollution levels brought by the Beijing Olympic air pollution control measures .	2 23
23321859-3	EBC and urine samples from 125 healthy adults were collected twice in each of the pre- , during- , and post-Olympic periods .	1 12 127
23321859-4	Period-specific means of MDA and changes in MDA levels associated with increases in 24-h average pollutant concentrations were estimated using linear mixed-effects models .	
23321859-5	From the pre- to the during-Olympic period , when concentrations of most pollutants decreased , EBC MDA and urinary MDA significantly decreased by 24% ( P&lt;0.0001 ) and 28% ( P=0.0002 ) , respectively .	
23321859-6	From the during-Olympic to the post-Olympic period , when concentrations of most pollutants increased , EBC MDA and urinary MDA increased by 28% ( P=0.094 ) and 55% ( P=0.046 ) , respectively .	
23321859-7	Furthermore , the largest increases in EBC MDA associated with one interquartile range ( IQR ) increases in all pollutants but ozone ranged from 10% ( 95% CI : 2% , 18% ) to 19% ( 95% CI : 14% , 25% ) .	
23321859-8	The largest increases in urinary MDA associated with IQR increases in pollutant concentration ranged from 9% ( 95% : 0.3% , 19% ) to 15% ( 95% CI : 3% , 28% ) .	
23321859-9	These findings support the utility of EBC MDA as a biomarker of oxidative stress in the respiratory tract and urinary MDA as a biomarker of systemic oxidative stress in relation to air pollution exposure in healthy young adults .	11 23 1 2 111 1114
23321859-10	Both EBC and urine samples can be collected noninvasively in the general population .	
14644665-0	The collapse of the World Trade Center ( WTC ) on 11 September 2001 exposed New York City firefighters to smoke and dust of unprecedented magnitude and duration .	
14644665-1	The chemicals and the concentrations produced from any fire are difficult to predict , but estimates of internal dose exposures can be assessed by the biological monitoring of blood and urine .	
14644665-2	We analyzed blood and urine specimens obtained from 321 firefighters responding to the WTC fires and collapse for 110 potentially fire-related chemicals .	1 122 12 127
14644665-3	Controls consisted of 47 firefighters not present at the WTC .	
14644665-4	Sampling occurred 3 weeks after 11 September , while fires were still burning .	
14644665-5	When reference or background ranges were available , most chemical concentrations were found to be generally low and not outside these ranges .	
14644665-6	Compared with controls , the exposed firefighters showed significant differences in adjusted geometric means for six of the chemicals and significantly greater detection rates for an additional three .	
14644665-7	Arrival time was a significant predictor variable for four chemicals .	
14644665-8	Special Operations Command firefighters ( n = 95 ) , compared with other responding WTC firefighters ( n = 226 ) , had differences in concentrations or detection rate for 14 of the chemicals .	
14644665-9	Values for the Special Operations Command firefighters were also significantly different from the control group values for these same chemicals and for two additional chemicals .	
14644665-10	Generally , the chemical concentrations in the other firefighter group were not different from those of controls .	
14644665-11	Biomonitoring was used to characterize firefighter exposure at the WTC disaster .	
14644665-12	Although some of the chemicals analyzed showed statistically significant differences , these differences were generally small .	
14615234-0	We studied a population-based sample of 143 residents of a community in which the municipal water supply had been contaminated with trichloroethylene ( TCE ) and related chemicals from several adjacent hazardous waste sites between 1981 and 1986 .	
14615234-1	A hydraulic simulation model was used in conjunction with a geographic information system ( GIS ) to estimate residential water supply exposures to TCE ; 80% of the participants had potential TCE exposure exceeding the maximum contaminant level ( 5 ppb ) .	24 2 241
14615234-2	The Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery ( NCTB ) , tests of visual contrast sensitivity , and the profile of mood states ( POMS ) were administered approximately 6 years following peak concentrations of TCE in municipal drinking water .	1 11 112
14615234-3	Multivariate analysis of variance adjusted for potential confounders was used to compare mean test scores of residents classified by estimated TCE exposure ( &lt ; or =5 , &gt;5-10 , &gt;10-15 , &gt;15 ppb ) .	
14615234-4	TCE exposure &gt;15 ppb was associated with poorer performance on the digit symbol , contrast sensitivity C test , and contrast sensitivity D test and higher mean scores for confusion , depression , and tension .	1 11 112
14615234-5	We found evidence of a strong interaction between exposure to TCE and alcohol consumption ; the associations for the NCTB and POMS among persons in the high-exposure group who also consumed alcohol were stronger and were statistically significant for the Benton , digit symbol , digit span , and simple reaction time tests , as well as for confusion , depression , and tension .	1 11 112
14615234-6	This study adds to the evidence that long-term exposure to low concentrations of TCE is associated with neurobehavioral deficits and demonstrates the usefulness of GIS-based modeling in exposure assessment .	
23340702-0	The impact of air pollution on fetal growth remains controversial , in part , because studies have been limited to sub-regions of the United States with limited variability .	
23340702-1	No study has examined air pollution impacts on neonatal health care utilization .	
23340702-2	We performed descriptive , univariate and multivariable analyses on administrative hospital record data from 222,359 births in the 2000 , 2003 and 2006 Kids Inpatient Database linked to air pollution data drawn from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Aerometric Information Retrieval System .	2 231 23
23340702-3	In this study , air pollution exposure during the birth month was estimated based on birth hospital address .	2 231 23
23340702-4	Although air pollutants were not individually associated with mean birth weight , a three-pollutant model controlling for hospital characteristics , demographics , and birth month identified 9.3% and 7.2% increases in odds of low birth weight and very low birth weight for each Î¼g/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) ( both P&lt;0.0001 ) .	1 11 112
23340702-5	PM(2.5) and NO(2) were associated with -3.0% odds/p.p.m. and +2.5% odds/p.p.b. of preterm birth , respectively ( both P&lt;0.0001 ) .	
23340702-6	A four-pollutant multivariable model indicated a 0.05 days/p.p.m .	
23340702-7	NO(2) decrease in length of the birth hospitalization ( P=0.0061 ) and a 0.13 days increase/p.p.m .	
23340702-8	CO ( P=0.0416 ) .	
23340702-9	A $1166 increase in per child costs was estimated for the birth hospitalization per p.p.m .	
23340702-10	CO ( P=0.0002 ) and $964 per unit increase in O(3) ( P=0.0448 ) .	
23340702-11	A reduction from the 75th to the 25th percentile in the highest CO quartile for births predicts annual savings of $134.7 million in direct health care costs .	
23340702-12	In a national , predominantly urban , sample , air pollutant exposures during the month of birth are associated with increased low birth weight and neonatal health care utilization .	
23340702-13	Further study of this database , with enhanced control for confounding , improved exposure assessment , examination of exposures across multiple time windows in pregnancy , and in the entire national sample , is supported by these initial investigations .	
14594631-0	Prenatal pesticide exposures may adversely affect children's health .	
14594631-1	However , exposure and health research is hampered by the lack of reliable fetal exposure data .	
14594631-2	No studies have been published that report measurements of commonly used nonpersistent pesticides in human amniotic fluid , although recent studies of pesticides in urine from pregnant women and in meconium indicate that fetuses are exposed to these chemicals .	
14594631-3	Amniotic fluid collected during amniocentesis is the only medium available to characterize direct fetal exposures early in pregnancy ( approximately 18 weeks of gestation ) .	1 12 125
14594631-4	As a first step in validating this exposure biomarker , we collected 100 amniotic fluid samples slated for disposal and evaluated analytical methods to measure organophosphate and carbamate pesticides and metabolites , synthetic pyrethroid metabolites , herbicides , and chlorinated phenolic compounds .	1 12 125
14594631-5	The following six phenols were detected ( detection frequency ) : 1- and 2-naphthol ( 70% ) , 2,5-dichlorophenol ( 55% ) , carbofuranphenol ( 5% ) , ortho-phenylphenol ( 30% ) , and pentachlorophenol ( 15% ) , with geometric mean concentrations of 0.72 , 0.39 , 0.12 , 0.13 , and 0.23 microg/L , respectively , for positive values .	
14594631-6	The organophosphate metabolites diethylphosphate and dimethylphosphate were detected in two ( 10% ) samples , and dimethylthiophosphate was detected in one ( 5% ) sample , with geometric mean concentrations of 0.31 , 0.32 , and 0.43 microg/L , respectively , for positive values .	
14594631-7	These levels are low compared with levels reported in urine , blood , and meconium in other studies , but indicate direct exposures to the young fetus , possibly during critical periods of development .	
14594631-8	Results of this pilot study suggest that amniotic fluid offers a unique opportunity to investigate fetal exposures and health risks .	
19165401-0	BACKGROUND Childhood respiratory allergies , which contribute to missed school days and other activity limitations , have increased in recent years , possibly due to environmental factors .	
19165401-1	OBJECTIVE In this study we examined whether air pollutants are associated with childhood respiratory allergies in the United States .	
19165401-2	METHODS For the approximately 70,000 children from the 1999-2005 National Health Interview Survey eligible for this study , we assigned between 40,000 and 60,000 ambient pollution monitoring data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , depending on the pollutant .	2 231 23
19165401-3	We used monitors within 20 miles of the child's residential block group .	2 231 23
19165401-4	We used logistic regression models , fit with methods for complex surveys , to examine the associations between the reporting of respiratory allergy or hay fever and annual average exposure to particulate matter &lt ; or = 2.5 microm in diameter ( PM2.5 ) , PM &lt ; or = 10 microm in diameter , sulfur dioxide , and nitrogen dioxide and summer exposure to ozone , controlling for demographic and geographic factors .	
19165401-5	RESULTS Increased respiratory allergy/hay fever was associated with increased summer O3 levels [ adjusted odds ratio ( AOR ) per 10 ppb = 1.20 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.15-1.26 ] and increased PM2.5 ( AOR per 10 microg/m3 = 1.23 ; 95% CI , 1.10-1.38 ) .	
19165401-6	These associations persisted after stratification by urban-rural status , inclusion of multiple pollutants , and definition of exposures by differing exposure radii .	
19165401-7	No associations between the other pollutants and the reporting respiratory allergy/hay fever were apparent .	
19165401-8	CONCLUSIONS These results provide evidence of adverse health for children living in areas with chronic exposure to higher levels of O3 and PM2.5 compared with children with lower exposures .	
18288328-0	BACKGROUND Calcium homeostasis is a known target of several environmental toxicants including lead and mercury .	
18288328-1	OBJECTIVE Our goal was to determine the relationship between Hg exposure and erythrocyte Ca pump activity in women at delivery and in their newborns .	
18288328-2	METHODS We determined total Hg as well as Pb concentrations in 81 hair and blood samples obtained at delivery .	1 122 12 123
18288328-3	Basal and calmodulin-stimulated Ca pump activity was measured in red blood cells from cord blood and maternal erythrocyte plasma membranes .	11 12 1113 1 122 111
18288328-4	RESULTS Maternal hair Hg negatively correlates with Ca pump activity in maternal and cord blood erythrocytes .	1 12 123
18288328-5	Pb and Hg both independently correlate negatively with Ca pump activity without any statistically significant interaction .	
18288328-6	After adjustment for potential confounders , Pb and Hg explain about 30% and 7% of total variance of Ca pump activity in newborns and mothers , respectively .	
18288328-7	CONCLUSION Our findings confirm results reported in previous experimental studies and support the use of biomarkers in newborns from general population .	
18288327-0	BACKGROUND Urinary mercury ( U-Hg ) excretion is a commonly used biomarker for mercury exposure from dental amalgam restorations .	
18288327-1	OBJECTIVES Our goal was to determine the most efficient measure of dental amalgam exposure for use in analyses concerning U-Hg in children .	24 244 2
18288327-2	METHODS We analyzed time-sensitive longitudinal amalgam exposure data in children randomized to amalgam restorations ( n = 267 ) during the 5-year New England Children's Amalgam Trial .	24 12 1 244 2 127
18288327-3	We calculated 8 measures of amalgam , evaluating current versus cumulative exposure , teeth versus surfaces , and total versus posterior occlusal amalgams .	
18288327-4	Urine samples collected during follow-up years 3-5 were analyzed for mercury excretion .	1 12 127
18288327-5	Multivariate models for current and cumulative U-Hg excretion estimated associations between exposures and U-Hg .	
18288327-6	RESULTS At the end of follow-up , the average ( +/- SD ) cumulative exposure was 10.3 +/- 6.1 surfaces and 5.7 +/- 2.9 teeth ever filled with amalgam , corresponding to 30 +/- 21 surface-years .	
18288327-7	Amalgam measures and U-Hg were moderately correlated .	
18288327-8	Of amalgam exposure measures , the current total of amalgam surfaces was the most robust predictor of current U-Hg , whereas posterior occlusal surface-years was best for cumulative U-Hg .	24 244 2
18288327-9	In multivariate models , each additional amalgam surface present was associated with a 9% increase in current U-Hg , and each additional posterior occlusal surface-year was associated with a 3% increase in cumulative U-Hg excretion ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
18288327-10	CONCLUSIONS One single measure of amalgam exposure is insufficient .	
18288327-11	Studies of cumulative effects of mercury from amalgam exposure in children are likely to have improved validity and precision if time-sensitive amalgam exposure measures are used .	
18288327-12	In contrast , simple counts of current amalgam fillings are adequate to capture amalgam-related current U-Hg .	
19270796-0	BACKGROUND Arsenic methylation relies on folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and facilitates urinary As elimination .	
19270796-1	Clinical manifestations of As toxicity vary considerably among individuals and populations , and poor methylation capacity is thought to confer greater susceptibility .	
19270796-2	OBJECTIVE After determining that folate deficiency , hyperhomocysteinemia , and low urinary creatinine are associated with reduced As methylation , and that As exposure is associated with increased genomic methylation of leukocyte DNA , we asked whether these factors are associated with As-induced skin lesion risk among Bangladeshi adults .	
19270796-3	METHODS We conducted a nested case-control study of 274 cases who developed lesions 2 years after recruitment , and 274 controls matched to cases for sex , age , and water As .	
19270796-4	RESULTS The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals ( CIs ) for development of skin lesions for participants who had low folate ( &lt ; 9 nmol/L ) , hyperhomocysteinemia ( men , &gt ; 11.4 micromol/L ; women , &gt ; 10.4 micromol/L ) , or hypomethylated leukocyte DNA at recruitment ( &lt ; median ) were 1.8 ( 95% CI , 1.1-2.9 ) , 1.7 ( 95% CI , 1.1-2.6 ) , and 1.8 ( 95% CI , 1.2-2.8 ) , respectively .	
19270796-5	Compared with the subjects in the first quartile , those in the third and fourth quartiles for urinary creatinine had a 0.4-fold decrease in the odds of skin lesions ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
19270796-6	CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that folate deficiency , hyperhomocysteinemia , and low urinary creatinine , each associated with decreased As methylation , are risk factors for As-induced skin lesions .	1 11 112
19270796-7	The increased DNA methylation associated with As exposure previously observed , and confirmed among controls in this study , may be an adaptive change because hypomethylation of leukocyte DNA is associated with increased risk for skin lesions .	1111 1 111 11
23357052-0	Exposure to biocontaminants is associated with behavioural problems and poorer cognitive function .	
23357052-1	Our study assesses the associations between early life exposure to home dampness , pets and farm animal contact and cognitive function and social competences in 4-year old children , and the associations between these indoor factors and microbial compounds ( bacterial endotoxin and fungal extracellular polysaccharides ) .	11 24 242 1 2 112
23357052-2	A Spanish population-based birth-cohort enrolled 482 children , and 424 of them underwent psychometric testing at 4 years of age , including the McCarthy Scales of Child Abilities ( MSCA ) and the California Preschool Social Competence Scale ( CPSCS ) .	1 11 112
23357052-3	Information on pet ownership , farm animal contact and home dampness was periodically reported by the parents through questionnaires .	
23357052-4	Microbial compounds were measured in living room sofa dust collected at the age of 3 months .	24 2 242
23357052-5	Persistent home dampness during early life significantly decreased the general score of MSCA by 4.9 points ( 95% CI : -8.9 ; -0.8 ) , and it decreased the CPSCS by 6.5 points ( 95% CI : -12.2 ; -0.9 ) in the child's bedroom .	
23357052-6	Cat or dog ownership were not associated with the outcomes , but occasional farm animal contact increased the general cognitive score of MSCA by 5.6 points ( 95% CI : 1.8 ; 9.3 ) .	
23357052-7	Cat and dog ownership were associated with higher levels of endotoxins in home dust .	24 2 242
23357052-8	None of the measured microbial compounds were related with the psychometric tests scores .	1 11 112
23357052-9	In conclusion , damp housing in early life may have adverse effects on neuropsychological development at 4 years old .	
23357052-10	More research is needed to explore the possible involvement of mycotoxins in the observed results .	
19270799-0	BACKGROUND Despite the endocrine system activity exhibited by polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , recent studies have shown little association between PCB exposure and breast cancer mortality .	
19270799-1	OBJECTIVES To further evaluate the relation between PCB exposure and breast cancer risk , we studied incidence , a more sensitive end point than mortality , in an occupational cohort .	
19270799-2	METHODS We followed 5,752 women employed for at least 1 year in one of three capacitor manufacturing facilities , identifying cases from questionnaires , cancer registries , and death certificates through 1998 .	
19270799-3	We collected lifestyle and reproductive information via questionnaire from participants or next of kin and used semiquantitative job-exposure matrices for inhalation and dermal exposures combined .	2 21
19270799-4	We generated standardized incidence ratios ( SIRs ) and standardized rate ratios and used Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate potential confounders and effect modifiers .	
19270799-5	RESULTS Overall , the breast cancer SIR was 0.81 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.72-0.92 ; n = 257 ) , and regression modeling showed little effect of employment duration or cumulative exposure .	
19270799-6	However , for the 362 women of questionnaire-identified races other than white , we observed positive , statistically significant associations with employment duration and cumulative exposure ; only smoking , birth cohort , and self- or proxy questionnaire completion had statistically significant explanatory power when added to models with exposure metrics .	
19270799-7	CONCLUSIONS We found no overall elevation in breast cancer risk after occupational exposure to PCBs .	
19270799-8	However , the exposure-related risk elevations seen among nonwhite workers , although of limited interpretability given the small number of cases , warrant further investigation , because the usual reproductive risk factors accounted for little of the increased risk .	
23361443-0	Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) has been previously associated with exposure to particulate air pollution .	
23361443-1	However , there is uncertainty about the agents and mechanisms that are involved .	
23361443-2	We aimed to determine the association of gases and particulates with OHCA , and differences in pollutant effects on OHCAs due to acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) vs those due to other causes .	
23361443-3	Helsinki Emergency Medical Services provided data on OHCAs of cardiac origin ( OHCA_Cardiac ) .	
23361443-4	Hospital and autopsy reports determined whether OHCAs were due to AMI ( OHCA_MI ) or other cardiac causes ( OHCA_Other ) .	
23361443-5	Pollutant data was obtained from central ambient monitors .	2 231 23
23361443-6	A case-crossover analysis determined odds ratios ( ORs ) for hourly lagged exposures ( Lag 0-3 ) and daily lagged exposures ( Lag 0d-3d ) , expressed per interquartile range of pollutant level .	2 231 23
23361443-7	For OHCA_Cardiac , elevated ORs were found for PM(2.5) ( Lag 0 , 1.07 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.01-1.13 ) and ozone ( O(3) ) ( Lag 2d , 1.18 ; CI : 1.03-1.35 ) .	
23361443-8	For OHCA_MI , elevated ORs were found for PM(2.5) ( Lag 0 , 1.14 ; CI : 1.03-1.27 ; Lag 0d , 1.17 ; CI : 1.03-1.33 ) , accumulation mode particulate ( Acc ) ( Lag 0d , 1.19 ; CI : 1.04-1.35 ) , NO ( Lag 0d , 1.07 ; CI : 1.01-1.13 ) , and ultrafine particulate ( Lag 0d , 1.27 ; CI : 1.05-1.54 ) .	
23361443-9	For OHCA_Other , elevated ORs were found only for O(3) ( Lag 1d , 1.26 ; CI : 1.07-1.48 ; Lag 2d , 1.30 ; CI : 1.11-1.53 ) .	
23361443-10	Results from two-pollutant models , with one of the pollutants either PM(2.5) or O(3) , suggested that associations were primarily due to effects of PM(2.5) and O(3) , rather than other pollutants .	
23361443-11	The results suggest that air pollution triggers OHCA via two distinct modes : one associated with particulates leading to AMI and one associated with O(3) involving etiologies other than AMI , for example , arrhythmias or respiratory insufficiency .	
19337508-0	BACKGROUND Arsenic exposure is associated with human cancer .	
19337508-1	Telomerase-containing human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) can extend telomeres of chromosomes , delay senescence , and promote cell proliferation leading to tumorigenesis .	
19337508-2	OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of As on hTERT mRNA expression in humans and in vitro .	1111 1 111 11
19337508-3	METHOD A total of 324 Inner Mongolia residents who have been exposed to As via drinking water participated in this study .	
19337508-4	Water and toenail samples were collected and analyzed for As .	1 123 12
19337508-5	Blood samples were quantified for hTERT mRNA expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction .	
19337508-6	The hTERT mRNA levels were linked to water and nail As concentrations and skin hyperkeratosis .	1 11 112
19337508-7	Human epidermal keratinocytes were treated with arsenite to assess effects on cell viability and hTERT expression in vitro .	
19337508-8	RESULTS hTERT mRNA expression levels were significantly associated with As concentrations of water ( p&lt;0.0001 ) and nails ( p=0.002 ) and also associated with severity of skin hyperkeratosis ( p&lt;0.05 ) , adjusting for age , sex , smoking , and pesticide use .	24 244 2 241
19337508-9	Females showed a higher slope than males ( females : 0.126 , p=0.0005 ; males : 0.079 , p=0.017 ) .	
19337508-10	In addition to water and nail As concentrations , age ( p&lt;0.0001 ) and pesticide use ( p=0.025 ) also showed significant associations with hTERT expression .	
19337508-11	The hTERT expression levels decreased with age .	
19337508-12	Tobacco smoking did not affect hTERT expression ( p=0.13). hTERT expression was significantly correlated with OGG1 and ERCC1 expression .	
19337508-13	The in vitro results also showed a dose-response relationship between arsenite concentrations and hTERT expression and reached the peak at 1 microM .	
19337508-14	CONCLUSIONS hTERT expression was associated with As exposure in vivo and in vitro .	
19337508-15	The increased hTERT expression may be a cellular response to genomic insults by As and may also indicate that As may function as a tumor promoter in carcinogenesis in humans .	
18288316-0	BACKGROUND In 1979 approximately 2,000 people were exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) due to ingestion of contaminated cooking oil in Taiwan .	
18288316-1	Although a previous study has shown delayed developmental milestones and poorer neurocognitive functioning in children born to exposed mothers , it is unclear whether neurocognitive functioning was impaired in people who were directly exposed to the PCBs and PDCFs .	
18288316-2	OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare neurocognitive functioning in people exposed to PCBs and PCDFs with that of unexposed sex- and age-matched neighbors .	11 1 112
18288316-3	METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study among exposed and unexposed subjects &gt ; or =60 years of age using prospective outcome measurements .	
18288316-4	We evaluated neurocognitive tests including cognition , memory modalities , learning , motor and sensory function , mood , and daily activity .	1 11 112
18288316-5	RESULTS In total , 162 ( 59% ) exposed and 151 ( 55% ) reference subjects completed this study .	
18288316-6	In exposed men , all test results were similar to the reference group ; however , exposed women had reduced functioning in attention and digit span ( ADS ) , visual memory span ( VMS ) , and verbal memory recalls ( VMR ) , especially learning ability .	1 11 112
18288316-7	We also found a borderline reduction in the Mini-Mental State Examination .	
18288316-8	The digit symbol , motor , sensory , depression ( determined by the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form ) , and activity of daily life were not different between the exposed and reference groups .	11 1 112
18288316-9	A significant dose-response relationship was found for VMR , ADS , and VMS .	
18288316-10	CONCLUSION Our study showed dose-dependent neurocognitive deficits in certain aspects of attention , visual memory , and learning ability in women previously exposed to PCBs and PCDFs , but not in exposed men .	1 11 112
15081720-0	It is suspected that persons who work in indoor environments near busy roadways are exposed to elevated levels of air pollutants during working hours .	2 232 23
15081720-1	This study evaluated the potential exposure and source contribution associated with traffic-related air pollution for workers ( polishers and repairmen ) in shoe stalls from each of 32 districts during working hours in Seoul , Korea .	
15081720-2	The shoe stalls have been located at very close distances to the busy roadways .	
15081720-3	In this study , shoe stall workers could be exposed to high levels of respirable suspended particulate ( RSP ) , nitrogen dioxide ( NO(2) ) and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) from outdoor sources such as traffic exhaust , as well as indoor sources in the shoe stalls such as dust on the shoes , portable gas ranges , organic solvents , adhesives and shoe polish .	
15081720-4	Compounds of particular note included indoor mean concentrations of benzene , toluene , m/p-xylene and o-xylene were 0.732 , 6.777 , 4.080 and 1.302 mg/m(3) , respectively , in all shoe stalls .	2 232 23
15081720-5	Mean indoor/outdoor ratios for toluene and m/p-xylene concentrations were 54.52 and 20.84 , respectively .	
15081720-6	The contribution of vehicle exhaust emissions to indoor air quality of shoe stalls was identified by means of correlating the relationships between simultaneously measured air pollutant concentrations indoors and outdoors .	2 232 23
15081720-7	Unlike RSP and NO(2) , indoor VOCs concentrations of shoe stalls mainly originated from indoor sources vs. outdoor sources .	2 232 23
23348067-0	BACKGROUND People in developed countries are widely exposed to low levels of organochlorine pesticides , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) .	
23348067-1	Seafood is a major contributor to PCB exposure .	
23348067-2	Toxicity of those various pollutants to reproductive and endocrine functions raises questions about possible effects on fertility .	
23348067-3	We explored whether serum levels of these pollutants and seafood consumption were associated with the fertility of couples enrolled in a French birth cohort ( PELAGIE ) .	24 12 1 122 2 243
23348067-4	METHODS Time-to-pregnancy was investigated in 3,421 pregnant women by asking how many months they had taken to conceive .	11 24 1 2 243 112
23348067-5	Levels of 14 organochlorine pesticides , 12 PCBs , and 10 PBDE compounds were measured in cord blood serum from a random subcohort ( n = 394 ) .	1 122 12
23348067-6	Mercury concentrations measured in maternal hair were considered as a potential coexposure .	1 12 123
23348067-7	Fecundability odds ratios ( ORs ) were estimated from multivariate discrete-time Cox proportional hazard models .	
23348067-8	RESULTS Shellfish consumption was associated with longer time-to-pregnancy ( fecundability OR â¥twice/week vs. &lt;twice/month = 0.71 [ 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.83] ) , but fish consumption was not .	24 2 243
23348067-9	Time-to-pregnancy increased with increasing serum levels for most of the compounds studied ( for total PCBs &gt;0.410 Âµg/L vs. &lt;0.266 Âµg/L , fecundability OR = 0.46 [ 0.32-0.66] ) .	
23348067-10	In multiple sensitivity analyses , reduced fecundability was most consistently associated with shellfish consumption , p,p'-DDE , total PCBs , PCB153 , and PCB187 .	
23348067-11	Models that simultaneously included multiple coexposure factors led to similar conclusions .	
23348067-12	CONCLUSIONS Our findings were robust in sensitivity analyses , including analysis restricted to primiparous women .	
23348067-13	These results suggest that PCBs , p,p'-DDE , and other shellfish contaminants may impair human fertility .	
15064163-0	Exposure to phthalates is widespread because of their use in plastics , cosmetics , and other consumer products .	
15064163-1	Phthalate exposure has been associated with adverse respiratory outcomes in children .	
15064163-2	With urinary phthalate measures , we assessed the association between phthalate exposure and four pulmonary function parameters [ forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume at 1 sec ( FEV1 ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , and maximum mid-expiratory flow ] among the 240 adult Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) participants with urinary phthalate data .	11 1 127 12 112
15064163-3	Linear regression models controlled for race , age , age squared , standing height , body mass index , cumulative smoking , and current smoking .	
15064163-4	Monobutyl phthalate ( MBP ) was significantly associated with decrements in three measures of pulmonary function ( FVC , FEV1 , PEF ) in males but not in females .	1 11 112
15064163-5	For a change from the 25th to the 75th percentile in MBP level among men , FEV1 decreased 112 mL ( SE = 51 , p = 0.03 ) .	
15064163-6	Monoethyl phthalate ( MEP ) was associated with lower FVC and FEV1 values in men .	
15064163-7	Monoethylhexyl phthalate ( MEHP ) , the metabolite of the plasticizer commonly used in medical tubing , was not adversely associated with any of the pulmonary function parameters evaluated .	
15064163-8	Our results suggest that MBP and MEP , but not MEHP , may influence pulmonary function among adult males .	
9651624-0	BACKGROUND Except for the leukemogenic effects of benzene , there is inadequate or sparse evidence on the carcinogenicity of the most common monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .	
9651624-1	The purpose of this study was to generate hypotheses on associations between exposure to benzene , toluene , xylene , and styrene and various common types of cancer .	
9651624-2	METHODS In the context of a population-based case-control study carried out in Montreal , 3,730 cancer patients ( 15 types of cancers , not including leukemia ) and 533 population controls were interviewed , and their job histories were translated by a team of experts into occupational exposures , including benzene , toluene , xylene , and styrene .	2 21
9651624-3	In the present analysis , exposure to these substances was compared between each case series and a control group pooling selected cancer patients and population controls , using logistic regression analysis .	
9651624-4	RESULTS Exposure levels were low for most exposed subjects , and there was a high correlation between exposure to benzene , toluene and xylene .	
9651624-5	For most sites of cancer there was no evidence of excess risk due to these substances .	
9651624-6	However , limited evidence of increased risk was found for the following associations : esophagus-toluene , colon-xylene , rectum-toluene , rectum-xylene and rectum-styrene .	
9651624-7	CONCLUSIONS These latter observations warrant further investigation .	
24210257-0	Most previous studies which have investigated the short-term effects of air pollution on airway inflammation , assessed by an increase of exhaled nitric oxide ( eNO ) , have been conducted among asthmatic children .	11 1 11122 1112 111
24210257-1	Few studies have considered this potential association among non-asthmatics .	
24210257-2	Furthermore , although both short- and long-term effects of air pollution on eNO had been reported separately , studies which include both are scarce .	
24210257-3	We explored associations between 24h NO2 and PM10 ( particles with aerodynamic diameters below 10Î¼m ) mass with eNO in 1985 children ( 192 asthmatics and 1793 non-asthmatics ) aged 10 years and accounted for the long-term effects of air pollution by adjusting for annual averages of NO2 , PM10 mass , PM2.5 mass ( particles with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5Î¼m ) and PM2.5 absorbance , using data from two German birth cohorts in Munich and Wesel .	2 231 23
24210257-4	In total , robust associations between 24h NO2 and eNO were observed in both single-pollutant ( percentage change : 18.30% , 95% confidence interval : 11.63-25.37 ) and two-pollutant models ( 14.62% , 6.71-23.11 ) .	
24210257-5	The association between 24h PM10 mass and eNO was only significant in the single-pollutant model ( 9.59% , 4.80-14.61 ) .	
24210257-6	The same significant associations were also observed in non-asthmatic children , while they did not reach significant levels in asthmatic children .	
24210257-7	Associations between annual averages of ambient air pollution ( NO2 , PM10 mass , PM2.5 mass and PM2.5 absorbance ) and eNO were consistently null .	
24210257-8	In conclusion , significantly positive associations were observed between short-term ambient air pollution and eNO .	2 231 23
24210257-9	No long-term effects of air pollution on eNO were found in this study .	
23375553-0	BACKGROUND Exposure to persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) is of concern in Arctic populations since these contaminants accumulate in fish and marine mammals , which is an important part of the traditional diet of these populations .	
23375553-1	Epidemiological and experimental studies have reported significant associations between POPs and increased blood pressure ( BP ) in populations with different degrees of exposure .	1 11 112
23375553-2	OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the risk of hypertension related to increasing levels of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and organochlorine ( OC ) pesticides .	1 11 112
23375553-3	METHODS Fifteen PCBs and 11 OC pesticides or their metabolites were determined in plasma of 1614 Inuit adults â¥ 18 years living in 9 towns and 13 villages in Greenland .	1 122 12
23375553-4	BP was measured using a standardized protocol .	
23375553-5	The risk of hypertension was estimated through logistic regression using POPs as continuous variables ( log-transformed ) .	
23375553-6	Hypertension was defined as systolic BP â¥ 140 mm Hg , diastolic BP â¥ 90 mm Hg and/or antihypertensive treatment .	
23375553-7	RESULTS Overall , the odd ratios ( ORs ) of hypertension were not statistically significant for dioxin-like PCBs , non-dioxin-like PCBs and OC pesticides after adjusting for confounders .	
23375553-8	Once the analyses were stratified by age category ( 18-39 and â¥ 40 years ) , increased risk of hypertension was observed for total dioxin-like PCBs among the youngest [ OR : 1.34 ( 95% CI : 1.03-1.74) ] while a borderline protective effect was observed for total non-dioxin-like PCBs [ OR : 0.81 ( 95% CI : 0.66-0.99) ] among the oldest .	
23375553-9	Higher risk of hypertension was also associated with increasing p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) concentrations among the youngest [ OR : 1.42 ( 95% CI : 1.08-1.85) ] .	
23375553-10	CONCLUSION Overall , no significant associations were observed between PCBs , OC pesticides and blood pressure in this highly exposed population although the associations differed by age category .	
14757379-0	A study was conducted with the objective of assessing how dietary , occupational , and residential exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) contribute to body burden among pregnant Mohawk women residing near three hazardous waste sites .	
14757379-1	From 1992 to 1995 , 111 pregnant women were interviewed about fish consumption and other environmental risk factors and donated a 20-mL venous blood sample for serum PCB analysis .	24 245 12 1 122 2 243
14757379-2	To supplement previous fish sampling , samples of residential soil , ambient air , wild duck , and local meats and vegetables were also collected and analyzed for PCBs .	245 24 2
14757379-3	The results indicated a significant decline in local fish consumption from an annual mean of 31.3 meals more than 1 year prior to pregnancy to an annualized mean of 11.7 meals during pregnancy .	24 2 243
14757379-4	This change was reportedly a result of the advisories issued against consumption of local fish by pregnant and nursing women of childbearing age .	
14757379-5	The geometric mean concentration of total PCBs in the serum was 1.2 ppb , a level that is similar to that in other studies of women with no unusual exposures to PCBs .	1 122 12
14757379-6	However , multiple regression analysis revealed that serum levels of total PCBs and three individual congeners were associated with local fish consumption .	24 12 1 122 2 243
14757379-7	The PCB levels in soil , air , and local foodstuffs other than fish generally were not elevated , except for those obtained in close proximity to one of the hazardous waste sites , and no association was found between serum PCB levels and exposure through these media or through occupation .	245 24 2 23
23377774-0	This study reports the quantification of the toxicity of particulate matter ( PM)-bound metals and their possible associated risks to human health .	
23377774-1	For assessment of PM , 24-h samples of PM(10) and PM2.5 were collected by Mini Vol-TAS sampler at an urban site of Pune .	2 23
23377774-2	Samples were sequentially extracted with ultrapure water and concentrated HNO3 and analyzed for " soluble " and " total " metals .	
23377774-3	Factor analysis identified the resuspension of road dust due to traffic , biomass burning , construction activities , and wind-blown dust as possible sources that played an important role for overall pollution throughout the year .	
23377774-4	Water-soluble proportion was found to be â¤ 20 % for Cr , Co , Fe , and Al ; â¥ 50 % for Sr , Cd , Ca , and Zn ; and a substantial proportion ( % ) for Mn , Ba , K , Na , Ni , Mg , Cu , and Pb metals in PM(10) .	
23377774-5	For PM2.5 , the water-soluble proportion was â¤ 20 % for Fe , Co , Ni , Cr , and Al , while Sr , K , and Cd were mostly soluble ( &gt ; 50 % ) and Cu , Ba , Mn , Ca , Zn , Pb , Na , and Mg were substantially soluble ( % ) .	
23377774-6	In the present study , among the toxic metals , Cd and Pb show higher concentration in the soluble fraction and thus represent the higher bioavailability index and especially are harmful to the environment and exposed person .	
23377774-7	Risk calculations with a simple exposure assessment method showed that the cancer risks of the bioavailable fractions of Cr , Cd and Ni were greater than the standard goal .	
24200045-0	Little data is available on the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) in marine organisms from South China Sea ( SCS ) .	
24200045-1	Five marine fish species were collected from Yongxing Island , SCS to investigate the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites ( DDTs ) .	
24200045-2	PBDEs , PCBs , and DDTs concentrations ranged from 2.0-117 , 6.3-199 , and 9.7-5831ng g(-1)lw , respectively .	
24200045-3	In general , contaminants measured in this study were at the lower end of the global range .	
24200045-4	Concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs were significantly correlated in fish samples , implying that PBDEs are as prevalent as PCBs in Yongxing Island .	
24200045-5	Among the five fish species studied , yellow striped goatfish had the highest concentrations of PBDEs , PCBs , and DDTs , probably attributed to its different living and feeding habits .	
24200045-6	The contaminant distribution pattern indicated that agrochemical source is more important than industrial source in Yongxing Island , SCS .	
24200045-7	The average estimated daily intakes of PBDEs , PCBs , and DDTs via fish consumption by local residents in the coastal areas of South China ranged from 1.42-5.91 , 3.20-13.3 , and 8.08-33.6ngd(-1) , which were lower than those in previous studies , suggesting that consumption of marine fish in Yongxing Island , SCS , might not subject local residents to significant health risk as far as POPs are concerned .	24 2 243
24200045-8	This is the first study to report the occurrence of POPs in marine biota from SCS .	
24192660-0	Drinking water intake of arsenic ( As ) from private wells may represent a significant exposure pathway and induce oxidative DNA damage .	
24192660-1	We measured total As concentrations in hair and nails , and concentrations of the different species of As and its metabolites as well as 8-OHdG in urine of 110 non-smoking adults living in a rural region of the Province of Quebec , Canada .	11 1111 12 1 11122 123 111 1114 127 1112
24192660-2	Significant differences in exposure biomarker levels were observed between individuals consuming drinking water with As levels ofâ¤1.0,&gt;1.0 -â¤10 and&gt;10âÎ¼g/l .	24 2 241
24192660-3	Multivariate linear regression analysis also showed a significant relationship between estimated daily drinking water intakes of As and biomarker levels .	24 2 241
24192660-4	Conversely , 8-OHdG levels were not significantly related to daily drinking water intakes of As or to hair , nail or urinary exposure biomarker levels , according to multivariate linear regression analysis .	1 123 12 127
24192660-5	Even at the relatively low levels of As found in well water of our participants , water consumption significantly increases their body load of As , as confirmed by multiple matrix measurements , which reflected exposure over different time frames .	24 2 241
24192660-6	However , this increased internal As dose was not associated with higher oxidative damage to DNA as reflected by urinary 8-OHdG levels .	
9703491-0	Ingestion of arsenic-contaminated drinking water is associated with an increased risk of several cancers , including skin and bladder malignancies ; but it is not yet clear whether such adverse effects are present at levels to which the U.S. population is exposed .	
9703491-1	In New Hampshire , detectable levels of arsenic have been reported in drinking water supplies throughout the state .	
9703491-2	Therefore , we have begun a population-based epidemiologic case-control study in which residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with primary squamous cell ( n = 900 ) and basal cell ( n = 1200 ) skin cancers are being selected from a special statewide skin cancer incidence survey ; patients diagnosed with primary bladder cancers ( n = 450 ) are being identified through the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry .	
9703491-3	Exposure histories of these patients will be compared to a control group of individuals randomly selected from population lists ( n = 1200 ) .	
9703491-4	Along with a detailed personal interview , arsenic and other trace elements are being measured in toenail clipping samples using instrumental neutron activation analysis .	1 123 12
9703491-5	Household water samples are being tested on selected participants using a hydride generation technique with high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .	24 2 241
9703491-6	In the first 793 households tested arsenic concentrations ranged from undetectable ( 0.01 microgram/l ) to 180 microgram/l .	
9703491-7	Over 10% of the private wells contained levels above 10 microgram/l and 2.5% were above 50 microgram/l .	24 2 241
9703491-8	Based on our projected sample size , we expect at least 80% power to detect a 2-fold risk of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or bladder cancer among individuals with the highest 5% toenail concentrations of arsenic .	1 123 12
24189320-0	It remains unclear whether exposure to low-level mercury ( Hg ) is associated with impaired renal function , and whether omega-3 fatty acid ( FA ) intake could affect the association of interest .	
24189320-1	The current study examined the association of blood Hg and omega-3 FAs with renal function using data from 1046 subjects aged 40 or above from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .	1 122 12
24189320-2	Kidney function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) and occurrence of albuminuria .	11 1 11123 111 112 1112
24189320-3	Logistic regression analyses were applied to assess the association of interest with confounding variable adjustment .	
24189320-4	The analyses indicated that blood Hg was associated with reduced eGFR ( &lt;60mL/min/1.73m(2) ) in a dose-response fashion ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	1 122 12
24189320-5	The association was particularly apparent with adjustment for blood omega-3 FA levels .	
24189320-6	The adjusted odds ratio for having reduced eGFR was 2.94 ( 95% confidence interval=1.04-8.33 ) in the highest tertile of blood Hg as compared with the lowest tertile .	
24189320-7	There was no significant association between Hg exposure and albuminuria .	
24189320-8	In summary , this study demonstrates that Hg exposure is associated with increased odds of having lower GFR in the US population aged 40 or above .	
24189320-9	A statistical association with albuminuria was not apparent .	
24189320-10	We also observed that omega-3 FA intake may play a preventive role in Hg-induced nephrotoxicity .	
24189320-11	Additional studies are warranted to determine the sources , exposure routes , and forms of Hg most responsible for observed associations .	
23384555-0	BACKGROUND Arsenic exposure from drinking water has been associated with heart disease ; however , underlying mechanisms are uncertain .	
23384555-1	OBJECTIVE We evaluated the association between a history of arsenic exposure from drinking water and the prolongation of heart rate-corrected QT ( QTc ) , PR , and QRS intervals.Method : We conducted a study of 1,715 participants enrolled at baseline from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study .	11 24 1 2 241 112
23384555-2	We assessed the relationship of arsenic exposure in well water and urine samples at baseline with parameters of electrocardiogram ( ECG ) performed during 2005-2010 , 5.9 years on average since baseline .	11 24 12 127 1 2 241 112
23384555-3	RESULTS The adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) for QTc prolongation , defined as a QTc â¥ 450 msec in men and â¥ 460 msec in women , was 1.17 ( 95% CI : 1.01 , 1.35 ) for a 1-SD increase in well-water arsenic ( 108.7 Âµg/L ) .	
23384555-4	The positive association appeared to be limited to women , with adjusted ORs of 1.24 ( 95% CI : 1.05 , 1.47 ) and 1.24 ( 95% CI : 1.01 , 1.53 ) for a 1-SD increase in baseline well-water and urinary arsenic , respectively , compared with 0.99 ( 95% CI : 0.73 , 1.33 ) and 0.86 ( 95% CI : 0.49 , 1.51 ) in men .	
23384555-5	There were no apparent associations of baseline well-water arsenic or urinary arsenic with PR or QRS prolongation in women or men .	
23384555-6	CONCLUSIONS Long-term arsenic exposure from drinking water ( average 95 Âµg/L ; range , 0.1-790 Âµg/L ) was associated with subsequent QT-interval prolongation in women .	24 2 241
23384555-7	Future longitudinal studies with repeated ECG measurements would be valuable in assessing the influence of changes in exposure .	
9717248-0	The average person in Hong Kong consumes fish or shellfish four or more times a week averaging about 60 Kg of fish per year .	
9717248-1	Even though the mean mercury level in store-bought Hong Kong fish was only 0.12 mg/kg , corroborating evidence is presented from numerous studies to support the view that mercury bioaccumulates .	
9717248-2	By the time a typical Hong Kong male reaches 30 years of age he will have accumulated approximately 4 mg/kg mercury in his hair .	
9717248-3	By age 60 , his hair mercury levels will have increased to about 7.5 mg/kg .	
9717248-4	Hair is a useful indicator of mercury exposure .	
9717248-5	In the U.S. over a million hair samples have been examined for mercury ( mean , 1.5 mg/kg ) .	
9717248-6	The mean hair mercury concentration for over 200 Hong Kong residents was 3.3 mg/kg which is more than double the U.S. mean ( well over one standard deviation above the U.S. mean ) .	1 123 12
9717248-7	Two lines of evidence support the hypothesis that fish is the major source of methyl mercury in the diet of Hong Kong residents. 1 .	
9717248-8	Individuals consuming 4 or more meals of fish per week had a hair mercury of 4.07 mg/kg dry weight of hair while those consuming fish less frequently had significantly lower levels ( 2.56 mg/kg). 2 .	24 2 243
9717248-9	Hong Kong residents that consume no fish had only 0.38 mg/kg hair mercury .	24 2 243
9717248-10	The World Health Organization has adopted the U.S. EPA levels for mercury and recommends that food with mercury concentrations of 0.5 mg/kg or more should not be sold for human consumption .	
9717248-11	Data presented in this paper are consistent with the notion that adoption of a 0.3 mg/kg mercury guideline would benefit residents in countries where rates of fish consumption are significantly higher than in the U.S. Japan , for example , has already adopted a 0.3 mg/kg mercury guideline .	
9717248-12	In Hong Kong there is a significant correlation ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) between male subfertility and the level of mercury in the hair of males between the ages of 25 and 75 .	1 123 12
9717248-13	Our study of individuals who have been eating mercury contaminated fish steadily for many years suggests that a daily mercury intake of only 0.3 to 0.7 mg/kg body weight may be sufficient to inhibit spermatogenesis in some Hong Kong males .	24 2 243
9717248-14	Male subfertility has been correlated with both elevated mercury and the presence of various organochlorines in the diet .	
9717248-15	To determine whether fish sold in Hong Kong with elevated levels of mercury also had elevated levels of organochlorines we analyzed fish for both mercury and organochlorine content of their dorsal muscle tissue .	
9717248-16	Because analysis of fish tissue for lipids and a wide range of organochlorines is both very time consuming and expensive , only 15 different species of fish were tested .	
9717248-17	Organochlorine concentrations were low and there was no correlation between mercury and organochlorine in the 15 fish tested for both organochlorines and mercury .	
9717248-18	As a result of these tests we concluded that mercury could not be ruled out as the principal causal factor associated with the lack of fertility in Hong Kong males .	
23394847-0	The ubiquitous use of phthalate esters in plastics , building material , medical devices , personal care products and food packaging materials results in a widespread exposure of general population .	
23394847-1	This study reports measurement of urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites in France and provides a first assessment of the exposure of French pregnant women to this chemical class .	1 12 127
23394847-2	For the majority of the phthalate metabolites , concentrations measured in urine were similar to those reported in previous studies except for two phthalates that were characterized by high concentrations of metabolites if compared to previous European and American studies : DiNP ( Di-iso-nonylphthalate ) and DEHP ( Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ) .	
23394847-3	In a second part of the study , a pharmacokinetic model was used in order to gain understanding on exposure to DEHP .	2 21
23394847-4	A high concentration of the primary metabolite of DEHP , MEHP ( Mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ) , was thus identified probably because of a very recent exposure to perfusion materials at the hospital .	
23394847-5	Pharmacokinetics modelling highlighted that gathering data on the time gap between exposure and biomonitoring is an essential information requirement for reconstructing the dose of non persistent pollutants .	
23394847-6	Information about exposure pathway is also crucial for conducting effective reverse dosimetry .	
14581048-0	Concentrations of total mercury were determined by cold-vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy ( CV-AAS ) in 221 caps and 221 stalks of 15 species of wild growing higher fungi/mushrooms and 221 samples of corresponding soil substrate collected in 1997-98 in Manowo County , near the city of Koszalin in North-central Poland .	
14581048-1	Mean mercury concentrations in caps and stalks of the mushroom species examined and soils varied between 30+/-31 and 920+/-280 , 17+/-11 and 560+/-220 , and 10+/-9 and 170+/-110 ng/g dry matter , respectively .	
14581048-2	Cap to stalk mercury concentration quotients were from 1.0+/-0.4 in poison pax ( Paxillus involutus ) to 2.8+/-0.7 in slippery jack ( Suillus luteus ) .	
14581048-3	Brown cort ( Cortinarius malicorius ) , fly agaric ( Amanita muscaria ) , orange-brown ringless amanita ( A. fulva ) , red-aspen bolete ( Leccinum rufum ) and mutagen milk cap ( Lactarius necator ) contained the highest concentrations of mercury both in caps and stalks , and mean concentrations varied between 600+/-750 and 920+/-280 and 370+/-470 and 560+/-220 ng/g dry matter , respectively .	
14581048-4	An estimate of daily intake of mercury from mushroom consumption indicated that the flesh of edible species of mushrooms may not pose hazards to human health even at a maximum consumption rate of 28 g/day .	24 2 243
14581048-5	However , it should be noted that mercury intake from other foods will augment the daily intake rates .	24 2 243
14581048-6	Species such as the sickener ( Russula emetica ) , Geranium-scented russula ( R. fellea ) and poison pax ( P. involutus ) did not concentrate mercury as evidenced from the bioconcentration factors ( BCFs : concentrations in mushroom/concentration in soil substrate ) , which were less than 1 .	
14581048-7	Similarly , red-hot milk cap ( L. rufus ) , rickstone funnel cap ( Clitocybe geotropa ) and European cow bolete ( S. bovinus ) were observed to be weak accumulators of mercury .	
14581048-8	Fly agaric ( A. muscaria ) accumulated great concentrations of mercury with BCFs reaching 73+/-42 and 38+/-22 in caps and stalks , respectively .	
14581048-9	Mercury BCFs of between 4.0+/-2.3 and 23+/-25 ( caps ) and 2.6+/-1.9 and 14+/-12 ( stalks ) were noted for the other mushroom species .	
14581048-10	Relatively great concentrations of mercury in fly agaric ( A. muscaria ) were due to preferential uptake of this element by this species .	
12500464-0	Toluene diisocyanate , or TDI ( CAS 584-84-9 ) is a well-known asthmagen and respiratory irritant .	
12500464-1	TDI is also known for its ability to irritate the skin and mucous membranes .	
12500464-2	To further investigate the dermal effects of TDI , NIOSH investigators conducted a cross-sectional study at a flexible foam manufacturing plant .	
12500464-3	A total of 114 workers participated in the study .	1 122 12
12500464-4	Participants completed a medical questionnaire , provided blood for antibody testing to TDI and other allergens , and a subset of participants reporting skin symptoms underwent skin patch testing to a standard diisocyanate panel .	11 1 122 12 112
12500464-5	Production line workers were more than twice as likely to report skin problems as those working in nonproduction areas ( PRR = 2.66 ; 95% CI = 1.14-16.32 ; P = 0.02 ) .	
12500464-6	Age , gender and duration of employment at the plant were comparable among participants working in production and nonproduction areas .	
12500464-7	Of the 100 participants who provided blood samples for antibody testing , specific IgG antibody to TDI was detected in two individuals , and none of the samples demonstrated specific IgE antibody to TDI .	1 122 12
12500464-8	Of the 26 workers who underwent skin patch testing , none developed reactions to the diisocyanate allergens .	
12500464-9	These results suggest that the skin symptoms among study participants represent an irritant rather than an immunologic reaction to TDI , or to an unidentified allergen present in the foam .	
23395527-0	Polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs ) were measured in serum of twelve firefighters sampled after a fire event in San Francisco , California , along with polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , p,p'-DDE , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , perfluorinated chemicals ( PFCs ) , bisphenol-A ( BPA ) and tetrabromobisphenol-A ( TBBPA ) .	1 122 12
23395527-1	TEQPCDD/F concentrations were relatively low ( mean 5pgg(-1) ( lipid weight ) , lw , range 1-11pgg(-1)lw ) , but concentrations of 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD , a congener indicative of exposure during firefighting , were elevated .	
23395527-2	Tentative WHO2005-TEQs calculated for PBDD/Fs in our samples ( mean 104pgg(-1)lw , range 0.2-734pgg(-1)lw ) suggested that PBDD/Fs may contribute substantially to dioxin-like toxicity in individual firefighters .	
23395527-3	PBDE concentrations were elevated in firefighter serum ( mean 135ngg(-1)lw , range 48-442ngg(-1)lw ) .	1 122 12
23395527-4	PBDE-209 , PBDE-47 and PBDE-153 were prevalent congeners ; PBDE-209 contributed &gt;50% of the total PBDE concentration in four individuals , implying continuous occupational exposure to deca-BDE .	1 122 12
23395527-5	Perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS ) was the dominant PFC in serum ( mean 12ngml(-1) ( wet weight ) , ww , range 3ngml(-1)ww to 59ngml(-1)ww ) , followed by perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) ( mean 7ngml(-1)ww , range 2ngml(-1)ww to 12ngml(-1)ww ) .	
23395527-6	Concentrations of perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) ( mean 2ngml(-1)ww , range 1-4ngml(-1)ww ) were higher than those reported in the high-smoke exposure group of World Trade Center fire responders , suggesting that the California firefighters were exposed to PFNA in smoke during firefighting .	
23395527-7	Given their elevated rates of cancers , these results illustrate the importance of monitoring halogenated contaminants including PBDD/Fs in firefighters .	
12483800-0	A random sample of 68 males and 25 females who reside in Mansoura city , Egypt , was examined for concentrations of cadmium , lead , and mercury in blood , urine , hair , and nails .	1 122 12 127 123
12483800-1	The effect of gender and smoking on such levels was studied .	
12483800-2	The influence of dental amalgam on the levels of mercury in these biological samples was also examined .	24 244 2
12483800-3	The results obtained show that only blood lead , which increased among males , was affected by gender .	
12483800-4	Blood levels of cadmium and lead as well as hair lead appeared to increase with smoking habit .	1 12 122 123
12483800-5	Mercury levels in blood and urine were related to the presence of dental amalgam fillings .	24 12 1 244 122 2 127
12483800-6	International comparisons between our results and the corresponding levels in other localities in the world showed that there were environmentally related variations in terms of cadmium levels in hair , lead levels in blood , urine , hair , and nails , and mercury levels in blood , hair , and nails .	1 122 12 127 123
12483800-7	In conclusion , reference intervals of cadmium , lead , and mercury in the biological samples are environmentally related parameters .	
12483800-8	Some factors , such as gender , smoking habit , and the presence of dental amalgam fillings , may affect such levels and therefore should be considered .	24 244 2
9755143-0	Residents living near a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility expressed concern to health officials over chemical emissions from the plant .	
9755143-1	Environmental monitoring of ambient air near the plant indicated the presence of toluene diisocyanate ( TDI ) , which was used in foam production .	2 232 23
9755143-2	Health officials collected blood samples from 113 residents and analyzed the blood sera for antibodies to TDI and related diisocyanates .	1 122 12
9755143-3	Ten of the 113 residents ( 9% ) had elevated levels of IgG or IgE antibodies specific for one or more diisocyanates .	
9755143-4	Exposure histories were taken from antibody-positive individuals to identify possible occupational exposure to TDI or the use of diisocyanate-containing consumer products .	
9755143-5	Exposure to TDI in ambient air may be responsible for the positive antibody responses detected in some residents of the community .	
24183346-0	Organochlorine ( OC ) pesticides are endocrine disruptors altering the thyroid hormonal system .	
24183346-1	The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between exposure to OC pesticides and thyroid status in adults from a rural area in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , heavily contaminated with OC pesticides .	
24183346-2	A cross-sectional study was carried out in 303 men and 305 women &gt;14 years old .	
24183346-3	Concentrations of 19 OC pesticides and levels of free thyroxine ( T4 ) , total triiodothyronine ( T3 ) , thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , anti-thyroperoxidase ( TPOAb ) and anti-thyroglobulin ( TgAg ) antibodies were analyzed in serum samples .	11 12 11122 1 122 11123 111 1112
24183346-4	Associations between OC pesticides concentrations and values of biochemical thyroid parameters were determined using multivariate regression models stratified by gender .	
24183346-5	Prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism and the presence of TPOAb antibodies were higher than those described for euthyroid populations elsewhere .	11 1 11123 111 1112
24183346-6	After adjusting for confounders , total T3 levels were associated with lower concentrations of endosulphan 2 in men and with higher alpha-chlordane , p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , endosulphan 2 , and methoxychlor in women .	
24183346-7	Levels of free T4 showed inverse association with beta-hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) and p,p'-DDT in men , and were positively associated with hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , heptachlor , o,p'-DDT , and p,p'-DDT in women .	
24183346-8	TSH levels were associated with higher beta-HCH in men .	
24183346-9	A positive association was observed between exposure methoxychlor in males and presence of TPOAb , but no association with TPOAb was found in women .	
24183346-10	These results suggest that OC pesticides can affect the thyroid system through gender-specific mechanisms that may differ among compounds .	
24183346-11	Further detailed investigations and health monitoring should be warranted for this population .	
12456850-0	BACKGROUND It has been suggested that mercury , a highly reactive heavy metal with no known physiologic activity , increases the risk of cardiovascular disease .	
12456850-1	Because fish intake is a major source of exposure to mercury , the mercury content of fish may counteract the beneficial effects of its n-3 fatty acids .	
12456850-2	METHODS In a case-control study conducted in eight European countries and Israel , we evaluated the joint association of mercury levels in toenail clippings and docosahexaenoic acid ( C22:6n-3 , or DHA ) levels in adipose tissue with the risk of a first myocardial infarction among men .	24 12 1 123 243 2
12456850-3	The patients were 684 men with a first diagnosis of myocardial infarction .	
12456850-4	The controls were 724 men selected to be representative of the same populations .	
12456850-5	RESULTS The average toenail mercury level in controls was 0.25 microg per gram .	1 123 12
12456850-6	After adjustment for the DHA level and coronary risk factors , the mercury levels in the patients were 15 percent higher than those in controls ( 95 percent confidence interval , 5 to 25 percent ) .	
12456850-7	The risk-factor-adjusted odds ratio for myocardial infarction associated with the highest as compared with the lowest quintile of mercury was 2.16 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1.09 to 4.29 ; P for trend=0.006 ) .	
12456850-8	After adjustment for the mercury level , the DHA level was inversely associated with the risk of myocardial infarction ( odds ratio for the highest vs. the lowest quintile , 0.59 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.30 to 1.19 ; P for trend=0.02 ) .	
12456850-9	CONCLUSIONS The toenail mercury level was directly associated with the risk of myocardial infarction , and the adipose-tissue DHA level was inversely associated with the risk .	1 123 12
12456850-10	High mercury content may diminish the cardioprotective effect of fish intake .	
24162035-0	BACKGROUND Previous findings suggest that developmental exposures to persistent organochlorine pollutants ( POPs ) may be detrimental for the development of the immune system in the offspring .	
24162035-1	Whether these suspected immunoregulatory effects persist beyond early childhood remains unclear .	
24162035-2	OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between maternal serum concentrations of POPs and the risk of asthma in offspring after 20 years of follow-up .	1 122 12
24162035-3	METHODS A birth cohort with 965 women was formed in 1988-1989 in Aarhus , Denmark .	
24162035-4	Concentrations of six polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) ( congeners 118 , 138 , 153 , 156 , 170 , 180 ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p,pÂ´-DDE ) were quantified in maternal serum ( n=872 ) collected in gestation week 30 .	1 122 12
24162035-5	Information about offspring use of asthma medications was obtained from the Danish Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics .	
24162035-6	RESULTS Maternal serum concentrations of HCB and dioxin-like PCB-118 were positively associated with offspring asthma medication use after 20 years of follow-up ( p for trend&lt;0.05 ) .	
24162035-7	Compared with subjects in the first tertile of maternal concentration , those in the third tertile of PCB-118 had an adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) of 1.90 ( 95% CI : 1.12 , 3.23 ) .	
24162035-8	For HCB the HR for the third versus the first tertile of maternal concentration was 1.92 ( 95% CI : 1.15 , 3.21 ) .	
24162035-9	Weak positive associations were also estimated for PCB-156 and the non-dioxin-like PCBs ( PCBs 138 , 153 , 170 , 180 ) .	
24162035-10	No associations were found for p,pÂ´-DDE .	
24162035-11	CONCLUSIONS Maternal concentrations of PCB-118 and HCB were associated with increased risk of asthma in offspring followed through 20 years of age .	
24161582-0	Background exposure to organochlorine ( OC ) pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) has been linked to type 2 diabetes .	
24161582-1	As OC pesticides and PCBs mainly accumulate in adipose tissue and there are physiological and clinical differences between visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) and subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT ) , we explored if there were associations of OC pesticides and PCBs in VAT or SAT with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance .	1 121 12
24161582-2	Participants were 50 patients with or without type 2 diabetes who underwent surgery for either cancer or benign liver or gallbladder lesions .	
24161582-3	We analyzed 14 OC pesticides and 22 PCB congeners in both VAT and SAT .	
24161582-4	Insulin resistance was estimated using homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA ) .	1 11 112
24161582-5	Although concentrations of OC pesticides and PCBs were strongly correlated between VAT and SAT , absolute concentrations differed substantially between them .	
24161582-6	In particular , concentrations of all PCBs were consistently about 5-10 times higher in VAT than SAT , but these patterns were independent of diabetes status .	
24161582-7	Some OC pesticides or PCBs , such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes ( DDTs ) , chlordanes , and PCBs with 5 or less chlorides showed significant associations with diabetes or insulin resistance .	1 11 112
24161582-8	For example , when tertiles of concentration-based summary measures were used , adjusted ORs were 1.0 , 2.3 , and 9.0 ( P trend=0.02 ) for DDTs in VAT and 1.0 , 2.1 , and 5.7 ( P trend=0.08 ) for PCBs with 5 or less chlorides .	
24161582-9	This study generally confirmed previous findings using serum concentrations .	
24161582-10	It would be useful to study pharmacodynamics of POPs in VAT and SAT further .	
23416456-0	BACKGROUND Bisphenol A ( BPA ) , a widely used endocrine-disrupting chemical , has been associated with increased body weight and fat deposition in rodents .	
23416456-1	OBJECTIVES We examined whether prenatal and postnatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference , percent body fat , and obesity in 9-year-old children ( n = 311 ) in the CHAMACOS longitudinal cohort study .	1 11 112
23416456-2	METHODS BPA was measured in spot urine samples collected from mothers twice during pregnancy and from children at 5 and 9 years of age .	1 12 127
23416456-3	RESULTS Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with decreased BMI at 9 years of age in girls but not boys .	1 12 127
23416456-4	Among girls , being in the highest tertile of prenatal BPA concentrations was associated with decreased BMI z-score ( Î² = -0.47 , 95% CI : -0.87 , -0.07 ) and percent body fat ( Î² = -4.36 , 95% CI : -8.37 , -0.34 ) and decreased odds of overweight/obesity [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 0.37 , 95% CI : 0.16 , 0.91 ] compared with girls in the lowest tertile .	
23416456-5	These findings were strongest in prepubertal girls .	
23416456-6	Urinary BPA concentrations at 5 years of age were not associated with any anthropometric parameters at 5 or 9 years , but BPA concentrations at 9 years were positively associated with BMI , waist circumference , fat mass , and overweight/obesity at 9 years in boys and girls .	1 12 127
23416456-7	CONCLUSIONS Consistent with other cross-sectional studies , higher urinary BPA concentrations at 9 years of age were associated with increased adiposity at 9 years .	
23416456-8	However , increasing BPA concentrations in mothers during pregnancy were associated with decreased BMI , body fat , and overweight/obesity among their daughters at 9 years of age .	
24157584-0	Elevated sewage sludge concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are due to their broad utilization in textiles and polymers , their resistance to biological degradation , and also their hydrophobic nature-which drives partitioning into wastewater solids .	
24157584-1	This study estimated the total U.S. emissions of PBDE due to sewage sludge land application and then determined the human inhalation exposure to sludge-associated PBDEs as a function meteorological conditions and downwind distances from an application site .	2 231 23
24157584-2	These aerosol exposures have also been incorporated into pharmacokinetic models to predict contributions to steady-state body burden .	2 21
24157584-3	Our results suggest that while the amount of PBDEs aerosolized during the land application process is small compared to aerosol emissions associated with product use , the application of sludges onto U.S. soils constitutes a major source of PBDEs entering the outdoor environment .	
24157584-4	Regarding aerosol exposure to nearby residents , the maximum daily inhalation dosages from a common land application scenario occur immediately after sewage sludges are applied and were 137 , 27 , 1.9 , and 81pg/day for significant congeners PBDE-47 , -99 , -153 and 209 respectively .	2 231 23
24157584-5	These doses are 1-2 orders of magnitude less than the standard daily inhalation exposure to the same PBDEs associated with home indoor air and are similar to doses from inhalation of urban and rural outdoor air .	
24157584-6	Under the worst-case atmospheric transport scenario , the dosages are reduced by approximately 1 order of magnitude when the setback distance between the sludge aerosolization source and human receptor is increased to 200m .	
24157584-7	Though the health implications of low-level exposures are not well-understood , these sludge-derived PBDE dosages contribute less than a tenth of 1% to the estimated total body burden of PBDE produced from inhalation of indoor and outdoor air , exposure to house dust , and exposure to PBDE from food and water intake .	
24157584-8	Overall , the inhalation of PBDE aerosols from sludge-applied fields does not represent a significant contribution to human exposure compared to other common indoor exposures .	
24157584-9	However , land application is a major environmental source of PBDEs and sludge health impact analyses should focus on the practice's impacts on other exposures , such as biomagnification in aquatic and terrestrial food webs .	
9828306-0	Effects of postnatal exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs ) , polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls ( Co-PCBs ) on lymphocyte subpopulations were investigated in the peripheral blood of 36 breast-fed Japanese babies .	1 11 1113 111
9828306-1	As a result , estimated total intakes of these chemicals in toxic equivalent quantity ( TEQ ) converted into 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( 2,3,7,8-TCDD ) equivalents from the breast milk positively and negatively correlated with the respective percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the blood of breast-fed babies .	11 24 1 1113 2 111 243
9828306-2	Consequently , the ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells showed significant increasing tendency with the estimated total TEQ intakes .	
9828306-3	Therefore , our study suggests that exposure to background levels of the highly toxic organochlorine compounds through the breast milk influences the human neonatal immune system .	
23416510-0	BACKGROUND Cadmium ( Cd ) is a human toxicant and carcinogen .	
23416510-1	Genetic variation might affect long-term accumulation .	
23416510-2	Cd is absorbed via iron transporters .	
23416510-3	OBJECTIVES We evaluated the impact of iron homeostasis genes [ divalent metal transporter 1 ( SLC11A2 ) , transferrin ( TF ) , transferrin receptors ( TFR2 and TFRC ) , and ferroportin ( SLC40A1) ] on Cd accumulation .	
23416510-4	METHODS Subjects were nonsmoking women living in the Argentinean Andes [ n = 172 ; median urinary Cd ( U-Cd ) = 0.24 Âµg/L ] and Bangladesh ( n = 359 ; U-Cd = 0.54 Âµg/L ) with Cd exposure mainly from food .	1 12 127
23416510-5	Concentrations of U-Cd and Cd in whole blood or in erythrocytes ( Ery-Cd ) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .	1 122 12
23416510-6	Fifty polymorphisms were genotyped by Sequenom .	
23416510-7	Gene expression was measured in whole blood ( n = 72 ) with Illumina DirectHyb HumanHT-12 v4.0 .	
23416510-8	RESULTS TFRC rs3804141 was consistently associated with U-Cd .	
23416510-9	In the Andean women , mean U-Cd concentrations were 22% ( 95% CI : -2 , 51% ) , and they were 56% ( 95% CI : 10 , 120% ) higher in women with GA and AA genotypes , respectively , relative to women with the GG genotype .	
23416510-10	In the Bangladeshi women , mean U-Cd concentrations were 22% ( 95% CI : 1 , 48% ) , and they were 58% ( 95% CI : -3 , 157% ) higher in women with GA and AA versus GG genotype , respectively [ adjusted for age and plasma ferritin in both groups ; ptrend = 0.006 ( Andes ) and 0.009 ( Bangladesh) ] .	
23416510-11	TFRC expression in blood was negatively correlated with plasma ferritin ( rS = -0.33 , p = 0.006 ) , and positively correlated with Ery-Cd ( significant at ferritin concentrations of &lt ; 30 Âµg/L only , rS = 0.40 , p = 0.046 ) .	
23416510-12	Rs3804141 did not modify these associations or predict TFRC expression .	
23416510-13	Cd was not consistently associated with any of the other polymorphisms evaluated .	
23416510-14	CONCLUSIONS One TFRC polymorphism was associated with urine Cd concentration , a marker of Cd accumulation in the kidney , in two very different populations .	
23416510-15	The consistency of the findings supports the possibility of a causal association .	
23419585-0	Serum antinuclear antibody positivity ( ANA ) has been associated with elevated serum polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) among residents in PCB-polluted areas ; however , associations in general populations have not been reported by congener type or with adjustment for mercury .	11 1 11123 111 1112
23419585-1	Cross-sectional data on serum PCBs , total blood mercury , ANA , and potential confounders age , race , body mass index , menopausal status , and dietary eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) were obtained from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) for males and females aged 12-85 .	1 122 12
23419585-2	PCB congeners were summed separately for dioxin-like and nondioxin-like PCBs ; the former were weighted for toxic equivalent factors .	
23419585-3	Total PCBs by congener type and mercury were analyzed as both continuous log-transformed variables and as categorical quintiles .	
23419585-4	Logistic regression models were stratified by sex .	
23419585-5	There were no associations between nondioxin-like PCBs or mercury and ANA among males or females .	
23419585-6	Among females ( n=114 affected and 518 unaffected ) , adjusting for potential confounders , the prevalence odds for ANA positivity were significantly elevated per incremental increase in log-transformed dioxin-like PCBs ( odds ratio { OR}=1.66 ; 95% confidence interval { CI}=1.24 , 2.23 ) ; the highest dioxin-like PCB quintile ( &gt;0.00425-0.04339ng/g ) was significantly associated with 4.04 ( 95% CI=2.43 , 6.70 ) greater prevalence odds for ANA positivity relative to the lowest quintile ( Ptrend&lt;0.001 ) .	
23419585-7	We present novel findings of an association between low-level dioxin-like PCBs and ANA among women .	
23419585-8	No associations were observed between mercury and ANA at mercury levels common to the U.S. population .	
12068749-0	The German Environmental Survey was conducted for the third time in 1998 ( GerES III ) .	
12068749-1	The probability sample of about 4800 subjects was selected to be representative for the German population with regard to region ( East-/West-Germany ) , community size , age ( 18 to 69 years ) and gender .	
12068749-2	Blood samples were taken from each study participant and questionnaires were used to get exposure-related information .	1 122 12
12068749-3	Cadmium , lead , mercury , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , hexachlorocyclohexane ( alpha-HCH , beta-HCH , gamma-HCH ) , 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene ( p , p'-DDE ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB-138 , PCB-153 , PCB-180 ) were analysed in whole blood to document the extent , distribution , and determinants of exposure of the general population to these substances .	1 122 12
12068749-4	The geometric means of Cd , Pb , and Hg in blood amounted to 0.44 , 31 , and 0.58 microgram/l , respectively .	1 122 12
12068749-5	Smokers showed a Cadmium level of 1.1 micrograms/l and non-smokers a level of 0.28 microgram/l .	
12068749-6	The geometric mean of lead was higher in the blood of males than of females ( 36 micrograms/l vs. 26 micrograms/l ) .	1 122 12
12068749-7	The concentration of mercury in blood depends on fish consumption and the number of teeth with amalgam fillings .	24 12 1 244 122 2 243
12068749-8	The mean concentrations of HCB and p , p'-DDE in blood were 0.44 microgram/l and 1.6 micrograms/l , respectively .	1 122 12
12068749-9	In East-Germany ( the former GDR ) the DDE concentration in blood was more than twice as high as in West-Germany .	1 122 12
12068749-10	Geometric means for PCB were 0.42 , 0.68 and 0.44 microgram/l for PCB-138 , PCB-153 , and PCB-180 , respectively .	
12068749-11	A marked increase of HCB , DDE and PCB levels with age could be observed. alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH could be detected in 1.7% and 5.2% of the samples only. beta-HCH was quantified in 34% of the samples with a 95th percentile of 0.5 microgram/l .	
23422685-0	BACKGROUND Several studies have reported negative associations of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and mercury ( Hg ) with duration of gestation and fetal growth in fish eating populations .	
23422685-1	Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) from fish , seafood and marine mammal intake has been reported to be positively related with pregnancy duration and fetal growth .	
23422685-2	So far , it remains unclear , however , if the associations of environmental contaminants ( ECs ) with growth are direct or mediated through their relation with the duration of gestation and the degree to which DHA intake during pregnancy attenuates the negative association of ECs with fetal growth .	24 2 243
23422685-3	OBJECTIVES To investigate direct and indirect associations of in utero exposure to ECs with fetal growth and pregnancy duration while taking into account the possible positive effects of DHA .	1 11 112
23422685-4	METHODS Pregnant Inuit women ( N=248 ) from Arctic Quebec were recruited and cord blood samples were analyzed for PCBs , HCB , Hg and DHA .	1 122 12
23422685-5	Anthropometric measurements were assessed at birth .	1 11 112
23422685-6	Path models were used to evaluate direct and indirect associations .	
23422685-7	RESULTS Cord concentrations of PCB 153 , HCB and Hg were significantly associated with shorter duration of pregnancy ( Î² varying from -0.17 to -0.20 , p&lt;0.05 ) .	1 122 12
23422685-8	Path models indicated that the associations of PCBs , HCB and Hg with reduced fetal growth ( Î² varying from -0.09 to -0.13 , p&lt;0.05 ) were mediated through their relations with shorter gestation duration .	
23422685-9	Cord DHA was indirectly related to greater growth parameters ( Î² varying from 0.17 to 0.20 , p&lt;0.05 ) through its positive association with gestation duration .	
23422685-10	CONCLUSION Prenatal exposure to ECs was associated with reduced gestation duration , which is a recognized determinant of fetal growth .	
23422685-11	DHA intake during pregnancy appeared to have independent positive association with fetal growth by prolonging gestation .	
23422685-12	Whether these associations are causal remains to be elucidated .	
9841806-0	In ecologic studies , participants are studied by groups , and the exposure status of each group is usually represented by a single indicator , mostly the mean exposure .	
9841806-1	In this paper , we propose using multiple variables derived from dummy variables at the individual level to describe the exposure .	
9841806-2	An analysis of the association between arsenic in drinking water and skin cancer was used as an example .	24 2 241
9841806-3	Well water arsenic levels and skin cancer incidence from 1980 to 1987 were assessed for 243 townships in Taiwan .	
9841806-4	We first analyzed the data using the mean arsenic concentration in each township as the only exposure variable .	24 2 241
9841806-5	The second analysis used multiple variables to describe arsenic exposure ; each variable denoted the percentage of wells with arsenic levels within a specific range in each township .	24 2 241
9841806-6	Although the first approach did not identify associations between arsenic levels and skin cancer , the multiple-variable approach identifies a positive association at the highest arsenic exposure category ( &gt;0.64 mg/L ) in both men and women .	
9841806-7	Therefore , using multiple variables to describe an exposure in ecologic studies may facilitate a better description of the exposure status and thereby lead to more accurate risk assessment , especially when the dose-response relationship is not linear .	
24125706-0	The shift in pesticide usage patterns demands a better understanding of the occurrence , fate and exposure risk of atmospheric current-use pesticides ( CUPs ) .	
24125706-1	Air samples collected in different seasons from an urban community in Guangzhou , China were analyzed to investigate seasonal variation , gas-particle partitioning and inhalation exposure of atmospheric organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides .	2 232 23
24125706-2	Chlorpyrifos and eight pyrethroids were detected in the air samples and the total concentrations of the nine CUPs ranged from 150 to 3816 pg m(-3) .	
24125706-3	Chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were the most dominant CUPs detected in the atmosphere , accounting for 68% and 15% of the total CUPs , respectively .	
24125706-4	Seasonal variation in concentration was observed for most CUPs , with peak concentrations occurring in summer and fall , which was consistent with their application patterns .	
24125706-5	Partitioning of chlorpyrifos between gas and particle phases was also seasonally-dependent , with more chlorpyrifos found in the gas phase in summer and fall .	
24125706-6	Additionally , gas-particle partitioning analysis suggested that chlorpyrifos might experience long-range transport .	
24125706-7	Evaluation of potential exposure from inhalation of atmospheric CUPs suggested that children , toddlers and infants had the highest exposure , but the risk quotients were low for all age groups when annual average concentrations were used as exposure metrics .	2 232 23
24125706-8	Exposure risk was higher in summer and fall than the annual average level due to higher atmospheric pesticide concentrations , longer exposure times and more pesticides being in the gaseous form .	
12049405-0	During May-September 1999 human hair samples were collected from the village of Caimito , a fishing community of the state of Sucre ( Colombia ) , in the San Jorge River basin area , and analyzed for total mercury ( t-Hg ) by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy .	1 123 12
12049405-1	T-Hg was measured in both male and female people aged 15-65 years , whose diet mainly consists of fish collected in nearby marshes .	
12049405-2	Average hair t-Hg concentration in people from Caimito was 4.91 +/- 0.55 microg/g ( n = 94 ) , similar to the value previously detected in fishermen living in the gold mining area , 50 km east .	1 123 12
12049405-3	Males had similar t-Hg concentrations ( 4.31 +/- 0.42 microg/g ; n = 56 ) to females ( 5.78 +/- 1.21 microg/g ; n = 38 ) and there was no difference in t-Hg levels between groups of different age .	
12049405-4	Mercury content in hair was weakly but significantly associated ( R = 0.20 , P = 0.05 ) with fish consumption .	24 12 1 123 243 2
9599454-0	This study reports the concentration levels of PCB , DDT , HCB and beta-HCH in the human milk of women living in northern Germany over a period of 12 years and determines factors that may influence these levels .	1 12 124
9599454-1	From 1986 to 1997 more than 3500 milk samples were analyzed for organochlorine compounds .	1 12 124
9599454-2	A questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding personal characteristics , life style factors and eating habits .	24 2 243
9599454-3	Descriptive statistics of concentration levels were computed to characterize the current extent of contamination .	
9599454-4	To follow time trends across the years homogeneous subgroups were compared and multiple regression analyses were used to investigate associations between determining factors and specific contaminants .	
9599454-5	Between summer 1995 and summer 1997 the median PCB concentration level was 0.502 mg/kg , the median DDT level 0.202 mg/kg , the median HCB level 0.065 mg/kg and the median beta-HCH level 0.036 mg/kg , all values expressed on a fat basis .	
9599454-6	The median concentration levels decreased by 80-90% during the past 12 years and the median PCB levels by 60% .	
9599454-7	The concentration levels of all substances were positively correlated with maternal age and negatively associated to parity , to the total period of breast-feeding and to a weight increase of mothers before and after delivery .	
9599454-8	Post-pregnancy BMI was a significant predictor of the likelihood of having higher concentrations for DDT , HCB and beta-HCH and of having lower concentrations for PCB levels .	
9599454-9	A balanced diet for at least 3 years was related to lower HCB and beta-HCH levels .	
9599454-10	Women who ate more than 100 g of fish or more than 700 g of meat per week were more likely to have higher PCB and beta-HCH levels or higher HCB levels , respectively .	24 2 243
9599454-11	Higher HCB and beta-HCH concentration levels were associated with lower birth weights of female infants .	1 11 112
9599459-0	In total , 45 adult women in Manila , the Philippines , volunteered to participate in the study by offering peripheral blood samples and 24-h total food duplicate samples .	24 12 1 122 2 243
9599459-1	In addition , they offered raw ( uncooked ) rice as well as wheat flour and maize starch from the kitchen .	
9599459-2	Lead ( Pb ) and cadmium ( Cd ) in food duplicates and blood samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after homogenization ( when necessary ) and wet-ashing .	1 122 12
9599459-3	The consumption of rice , wheat and maize was calculated by weighing each food item in the duplicates taking advantage of the food composition tables .	24 2 243
9599459-4	The dietary exposure level of the women was 11 micrograms Pb/day and 14 micrograms Cd/day , and the levels of Pb and Cd in their blood were 37 ng Pb/ml and 0.47 ng Cd/ml .	24 2 243
9599459-5	There is a subtle age-dependent increase in the dietary burden of Pb and Cd and also in blood levels of Pb and Cd .	1 122 12
9599459-6	Rice accounted for 18 and 21% of dietary Pb and Cd intake , respectively and cereals ( i.e. rice , wheat and maize in combination ) accounted for 24% both for Pb and Cd .	24 2 243
9599459-7	The calculation from the published data on air quality in Manila suggested that another and yet a greater source of Pb burden was Pb in atmospheric air which may account for 85% of total Pb uptake , whereas the amount of Cd in air was quite small ( i.e. &lt ; 10% of the total uptake ) .	
12040918-0	It has been argued that the release of mercury from amalgam fillings is of toxicological relevance .	
12040918-1	The aim of the study was to determine the internal mercury exposure of two groups differing in their attitude towards possible health hazards by mercury from amalgam fillings .	
12040918-2	It was to be examined if the two groups differ with regard to the mercury concentration in different biological matrices and to compare the results with current reference values .	
12040918-3	Blood , urine and saliva samples were analyzed from 40 female subjects who claimed to suffer from serious health damage due to amalgam fillings ( "amalgam sensitive subjects"). 43 female control subjects did not claim any association ( "amalgam non-sensitive controls" ) .	1 122 12 125 127
12040918-4	Mercury was determined by means of cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry .	
12040918-5	Number and surfaces of amalgam fillings were determined by dentists for each subject .	24 244 2
12040918-6	Median ( range ) mercury levels in blood were 2.35 ( 0.25-13.40 ) micrograms/l for " amalgam sensitive subjects " and 2.40 ( 0.25-10.50 ) micrograms/l for " amalgam non-sensitive controls " .	1 122 12
12040918-7	In urine , the median mercury concentrations were 1.55 ( 0.06-14.70 ) micrograms/l and 1.88 ( 0.20-8.43 ) micrograms/g creatinine respectively .	1 12 127
12040918-8	No significant differences could be found between the two groups .	
12040918-9	Mercury levels in blood and urine of the examined subjects were within the range of background levels in the general population including persons with amalgam fillings .	1 122 12 127
12040918-10	Stimulated saliva contained 76.4 ( 6.7-406.0 ) micrograms mercury/l in " amalgam sensitive subjects " and 57.0 ( 2.8-559.0 ) micrograms mercury/l in controls ( not significant ) .	1 12 125
12040918-11	Mercury levels in saliva did not correlate with the concentrations in blood and urine , but merely with the number of amalgam fillings or of the filling surfaces .	24 12 1 244 122 2 125 127
12040918-12	Mercury in saliva is therefore not recommended for a biological monitoring .	
24103350-0	BACKGROUND AND GOALS As part of the authorization process for the solid waste incinerator ( SWI ) in Modena , Italy , a human biomonitoring cross-sectional pilot study was conducted to investigate the degree to which people living and working in the proximity of the plant were exposed to SWI emissions .	
24103350-1	METHODS Between May and June 2010 , 65 subjects living and working within 4km of the incinerator ( exposed ) and 103 subjects living and working outside this area ( unexposed ) were enrolled in the study .	
24103350-2	Blood , serum and urinary metals ( Pb , Cd , Cu , Zn , Hg , Mn , Ni ) , urinary benzene , toluene , xylene ( BTEX ) , S-phenylmercapturic acid ( SPMA ) , and urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) were analysed .	1 122 12 127
24103350-3	Information about lifestyle , anthropometric characteristics , residence , and health status was collected by a self-administered questionnaire .	
24103350-4	Exposure to particulate matter ( PM ) emitted from the SWI was estimated using fall-out maps from a quasi-Gaussian dispersion model .	2 231 23
24103350-5	A multiple linear regression analysis investigated the relationship between biomarkers and the distance of a subject's place of residence from the SWI plant or the exposure to PM .	2 231 23
24103350-6	RESULTS Urinary BTEX and SPMA and blood , serum and urinary metals showed no differences between exposed and unexposed subjects .	
24103350-7	PAHs were higher in exposed than in unexposed subjects for phenanthrene , anthracene , and pyrene ( median levels : 9.5 vs. 7.2ng/L , 0.8 vs. &lt;0.5ng/L and 1.6 vs. 1.3ng/L , respectively , p&lt;0.05 ) .	
24103350-8	Multiple linear regression analysis showed that blood Cd and Hg and urinary Mn , fluorene , phenanthrene , anthracene and pyrene were inversely correlated to the distance of a subject's residence from the SWI .	
24103350-9	Urinary Mn , fluorene and phenanthrene were directly correlated to PM exposure .	
24103350-10	CONCLUSIONS This study , although not representative of the general population , suggests that specific biomarkers may provide information about the degree of exposure the subjects working and living in the proximity of the SWI plant may have to emissions from that facility .	
23443233-0	In order to evaluate the degree of arsenic ( As ) exposure and the factors influencing urinary As excretion and metabolism , 192 workers from a steel and iron smelting plant , with different type of work in production such as roller , steel smelting , iron smelting and metallic charge preparation , were recruited .	
23443233-1	Information about characteristics of each subject was obtained by questionnaire and inorganic As ( iAs ) , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) , dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) in urine were determined .	1 12 127
23443233-2	The results showed that steel smelters had significantly higher concentrations of DMA and total As ( TAs ) than rollers and metallic charge preparation workers , and iron and steel smelters had a higher value of primary methylation index and lower proportion of the iAs ( iAs% ) than rollers and metallic charge preparation workers .	24 12 1 244 2 243 127
23443233-3	In steel smelters , urinary As level exceeded the biological exposure index ( BEI ) limit for urinary As of 35âÎ¼g/l by 65.52% , and higher than metallic charge preparation workers ( 35.14% ) .	
23443233-4	The individuals consumed seafood in recent 3 days had a higher TAs than the individuals without seafood consumption .	24 2 243
23443233-5	Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that different jobs , taken Chinese medicine of bezoar and seafood consumption in recent 3 days were significantly associated with urinary TAs exceeded BEI limit value 35âÎ¼g/l .	24 244 2
23443233-6	Our results suggest that workers in steel and iron smelting plant had a lower level of As exposure , and seafood consumption and taking Chinese medicine of bezoar also could increase the risk of urinary TAs exceeded BEI limit value .	
24103347-0	Phthalates have been used for decades in large quantities , leading to the ubiquitous exposure of the population .	
24103347-1	In an investigation of 63 German daycare centers , indoor air and dust samples were analyzed for the presence of 10 phthalate diesters .	24 2 232 242 23
24103347-2	Moreover , 10 primary and secondary phthalate metabolites were quantified in urine samples from 663 children attending these facilities .	24 12 23 242 1 2 127 232
24103347-3	In addition , the urine specimens of 150 children were collected after the weekend and before they went to daycare centers .	1 12 127
24103347-4	Di-isobutyl phthalate ( DiBP ) , dibutyl phthalate ( DnBP ) , and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) were found in the indoor air , with median values of 468 , 227 , and 194ng/m(3) , respectively .	2 232 23
24103347-5	In the dust , median values of 888mg/kg for DEHP and 302mg/kg for di-isononyl phthalate ( DiNP ) were observed .	
24103347-6	DnBP and DiBP were together responsible for 55% of the total phthalate concentration in the indoor air , whereas DEHP and DiNP were responsible for 70% and 24% of the total phthalate concentration in the dust .	24 2 242
24103347-7	Median concentrations in the urine specimens were 44.7Î¼g/l for the DiBP monoester , 32.4Î¼g/l for the DnBP monoester , and 16.5Î¼g/l and 17.9Î¼g/l for the two secondary DEHP metabolites .	1 12 127
24103347-8	For some phthalates , we observed significant correlations between their concentrations in the indoor air and dust and their corresponding metabolites in the urine specimens using bivariate analyses .	
24103347-9	In multivariate analyses , the concentrations in dust were not associated with urinary metabolite excretion after controlling for the concentrations in the indoor air .	1 12 127
24103347-10	The total daily " high " intake levels based on the 95th percentiles calculated from the biomonitoring data were 14.1Î¼g/kg b.w. for DiNP and 11.9Î¼g/kg b.w. for DEHP .	2 21
24103347-11	Compared with tolerable daily intake ( TDI ) values , our " high " intake was 62% of the TDI value for DiBP , 49% for DnBP , 24% for DEHP , and 9% for DiNP .	
24103347-12	For DiBP , the total daily intake exceeded the TDI value for 2.4% of the individuals .	
24103347-13	Using a cumulative risk-assessment approach for the sum of DEHP , DnBP , and DiBP , 20% of the children had concentrations exceeding the hazard index of one .	
24103347-14	Therefore , a further reduction of the phthalate exposure of children is needed .	
9695171-0	Daily intakes of essential minerals and metallic micro-pollutants are estimated from foods usually eaten in France .	24 2 243
9695171-1	These foods are grouped in nine categories .	
9695171-2	For essential elements , intake estimates are comparable to the values recommended by the WHO .	
9695171-3	The cadmium value is lower than the tolerable daily dose .	
9695171-4	The estimated values are : cobalt 29 micrograms/day , chromium 98 microgram/day , copper 1.5 mg/day , manganese 2.5 mg/day , molybdenum 275 micrograms/day , zinc 14 microgram/day , aluminium 4.2 mg/day , boron 1.6 mg/day , cadmium 27 micrograms/day and nickel 231 microgram/day .	
23453434-0	Although the production and use of some persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) have been banned or highly restricted , human exposure remains a subject of investigation due to their environmental persistence .	
23453434-1	Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect the disposition of POPs in the mother's body , and thus fetal exposure .	
23453434-2	Changes in serum concentrations of organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) across pregnancy trimesters , and trans-placental transfer to the fetus were investigated .	1 122 12
23453434-3	Seventy-nine pregnant women in Trujillo , Peru were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy , and provided blood samples for the analysis of 35 PCB congeners , 9 OCPs , and 11 polybrominated biphenyl diethers ( PBDEs ) .	1 122 12
23453434-4	Subsequently , maternal blood samples were collected in the second ( n=64 ) and third trimesters ( n=59 ) , and cord blood samples ( n=50 ) were collected at delivery .	1 122 12
23453434-5	There were statistically significant changes across trimesters ( p&lt;0.05 ) for both fresh weight ( increase ) and lipid adjusted concentrations ( decrease ) of hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , 2,2-Bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene ( p,p'-DDE ) , PCB-74 , 118 , 138-158 , 153 , 170 , 180 and 194 .	
23453434-6	Fresh weight concentrations of these POPs increased from first to third trimester by 10-28% .	
23453434-7	On the other hand lipid adjusted concentrations decreased from first to third trimester by 16-28% .	
23453434-8	Serum lipids increased from first to third trimester by 53% indicating the dilution of the POPs in the lipids .	
23453434-9	Concentrations of 2,2-Bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane ( p,p'-DDT ) , its metabolite p,p'-DDE , PCB-118 , 138-158 , 153 , 170 and 180 above their limits of detection were measured in &gt;60% of cord serum samples .	
23453434-10	Intra-individual correlations in maternal serum concentrations were high for most of the POPs ( Ï=0.62-0.99 ; p&lt;0.05 ) while correlations between maternal and cord serum concentrations were also high ( Ï=0.68-0.99 ; p&lt;0.05 ) .	1 122 12
23453434-11	Results indicate that the disposition in the body and blood concentrations of POPs may change during pregnancy , and show trans-placental transfer of DDT , DDE and PCBs .	
11999800-0	Some environmental monitoring programs have reported increasing levels of certain polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE ) isomers in aquatic biota and in human breast milk .	
11999800-1	The commercial PBDE products are known as penta- , octa- , and deca-brominated diphenyl ethers ( PeBDE , OBDE and DBDE , respectively ) .	
11999800-2	Aside from the current European Commission's risk assessment initiative and efforts underway in Sweden , Canada and elsewhere to evaluate environmental levels , little is understood about sources of exposure and risks to humans .	
11999800-3	In this study , a multi-pathway human health risk assessment was performed to predict theoretical chronic daily intakes ( CDIs ) of PeBDE , OBDE , and DBDE by five different age groups : 0-2 , 2-6 , 6-12 , 12-18 , and 18-70 years .	2
11999800-4	Sources of exposure included air , drinking water , consumption of fish , vegetables , meat and dairy products , and ingestion of breast milk by infants .	24 2 241 243 23
11999800-5	In addition to a deterministic analysis , the risk assessment included a probabilistic analysis to derive the probability density functions describing the range of plausible exposures associated with eight different pathways , as well as aggregate lifetime exposures for each age group .	
11999800-6	The results were compared to CDI point estimates calculated by the European Chemicals Bureau as part of the European Commission's Existing Substances Programme .	
11999800-7	The major sources of uncertainties are discussed , including environmental sources , levels in different environmental compartments , toxicity , and human exposure .	
11999800-8	This paper also discusses the limitations in the current state-of-the-science and provides recommendations for improving the scientific relevance and accuracy of future environmental risk assessments of PBDEs .	
23459363-0	BACKGROUND Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA ) has been associated with adverse birth outcomes , but findings of previous studies have been inconsistent .	
23459363-1	OBJECTIVE We investigated the relation of prenatal BPA exposure with intrauterine growth and evaluated the effect of the number of measurements per subject on observed associations .	1 11 112
23459363-2	METHODS This study was embedded in a Dutch population-based prospective cohort study , with urine samples collected during early , mid- , and late pregnancy .	1 12 127
23459363-3	The study comprised 219 women , of whom 99 had one measurement , 40 had two measurements , and 80 had three measurements of urinary BPA .	1 12 127
23459363-4	Fetal growth characteristics were repeatedly measured by ultrasound during pregnancy and combined with measurements at birth .	
23459363-5	Linear regression models for repeated measurements of both BPA and fetal growth were used to estimate associations between urinary concentrations of creatinine-based BPA ( BPACB ) and intrauterine growth .	11 1 127 12 112
23459363-6	RESULTS The relationship between BPACB and fetal growth was sensitive to the number of BPA measurements per woman .	
23459363-7	Among 80 women with three BPA measurements , women with BPACB &gt ; 4.22 Î¼g/g crea ( creatinine ) had lower growth rates for fetal weight and head circumference than did women with BPACB &lt ; 1.54 Î¼g/g crea , with estimated differences in mean values at birth of -683 g ( 20.3% of mean ) and -3.9 cm ( 11.5% of mean ) , respectively .	1 11 112
23459363-8	When fewer measurements were available per woman , the exposure-response relationship became progressively attenuated and statistically nonsignificant .	
23459363-9	CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that maternal urinary BPA may impair fetal growth .	
23459363-10	Because previous studies have shown contradictory findings , further evidence is needed to corroborate these findings in the general population .	
11940449-0	Exposure of experimental animals or cultured cells to arsenic induces oxidative stress , but , to date , no examination of this phenomenon in humans has been reported .	
11940449-1	In this study we conducted a cross-sectional study in Wuyuan , Inner Mongolia , China , to explore the relationship between chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water and oxidative stress in humans .	1 11 111 1114
11940449-2	Thirty-three inhabitants who had been drinking tube-well water with high concentrations of inorganic arsenic ( mean value = 0.41 mg/L ) for about 18 years constituted the high-exposure group , and 10 residents who lived nearby but were exposed to much lower concentrations of arsenic in their drinking water ( mean value = 0.02 mg/L ) were selected as the low-exposure comparison group .	24 2 241
11940449-3	Results of the present study indicated that although the activity for superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) in blood did not differ significantly between the two groups , the mean serum level of lipid peroxides ( LPO ) was significantly higher among the high-exposed compared with the low-exposed group .	11 1 11121 1113 1112 111 1114
11940449-4	Elevated serum LPO concentrations were correlated with blood levels of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites .	1 122 12
11940449-5	In addition , they showed an inverse correlation with nonprotein sulfhydryl ( NPSH ) levels in whole blood .	1 11 111 1114
11940449-6	The subjects in the high-arsenic-exposure group had mean blood NPSH levels 57.6% lower than those in the low-exposure group .	
11940449-7	Blood NPSH levels were inversely correlated with the concentrations of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites in blood and with the ratio of monomethylarsenic to inorganic arsenic .	1 122 12
11940449-8	These results provide evidence that chronic exposure to arsenic from drinking water in humans results in induction of oxidative stress , as indicated by the reduction in NPSH and the increase in LPO .	
11940449-9	Some possible mechanisms for the arsenic-induced oxidative stress are discussed .	
9820686-0	Breast milk samples were collected and analysed within a comprehensive programme co-ordinated by WHO EURO to evaluate the possible health risk for breast-fed infants in chosen localities of European countries ( 'exposed ' and ' control ' ones ) .	1 12 124
9820686-1	The samples of breast milk were collected , stored transported and analysed by a standardised study protocol to assure the comparability of the results from different areas ( of 19 European countries ) .	1 12 124
9820686-2	The study included three categories of chemicals : polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins ( PCDDs)/polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( PCDFs ) , dioxine like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and other PCBs .	
9820686-3	The results obtained confirmed the correct choice of ' exposed ' and ' control ' regions in the Czech Republic as a suitable tool used to identify certain geographical areas with relatively high exposure levels for further risk management actions and possible follow-up epidemiological studies .	
9820686-4	The results obtained have shown high levels of PCBs in exposed region but not in the dioxine-like fraction , that ranged within a lower rank of a relevant European data .	
9820686-5	PCDs/PCDFs levels ranged in the same lower rank of values in comparison with e.g .	
9820686-6	Benelux countries .	
9820686-7	The data of this study does not confirm ideas about wide spread excessive exposure of central European population to polyhalogenated hydrocarbons via excessive contamination of a local food basket .	
23473698-0	A previously developed and validated methodology based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry was used for determine the concentration levels of 14 perfluoroalkylated substances ( PFASs ) in a set of 48 breast milk samples collected from French women in the frame of the ELFE pilot study .	1 12 124
23473698-1	In accordance with other similar studies conducted at european and international levels , PFOS , PFOA , and PFHxS were detected and quantified in most of the analyzed samples ( 90% , 98% and 100% , respectively ) , and appeared as major contributors to the total PFAS exposure ( 38% , 37% , 25% , respectively ) , whereas the other targeted PFAS were very rarely , if not , found at the limits of detection of the method .	
23473698-2	Also in agreement with other published data , the concentration levels measured for the detected substances varied from &lt;0.05 to 0.33Î¼g/L for PFOS ( median=0.079 ) , from &lt;0.05 to 0.22Î¼g/L for PFOA ( median=0.075 ) , and from 0.04 to 0.07Î¼g/L for PFHxS ( median=0.050 ) .	
23473698-3	On the basis of this relatively limited data set , no statistically significant relation was observed between these exposure levels and developmental outcomes , in particular the weight at birth .	1 11 112
23473698-4	Similarly , no relation was observed between the measured PFAS levels and various socio-demographical parameters including the consumption of seafood , alcohol , smoking , or socio-economical level .	24 2 243
23473698-5	These results suggest a need for further research and better knowledge regarding the sources , pharmacokinetics , and factors of exposure for other substances belonging to this class of emerging contaminants .	
24071022-0	Maternal diet not only provides essential nutrients to the developing fetus but is also a source of prenatal exposure to environmental contaminants .	
24071022-1	We investigated the association between dietary intake of dioxins and PCBs during pregnancy and birth size .	11 24 1 2 243 112
24071022-2	The study included 50,651 women from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study ( MoBa ) .	
24071022-3	Dietary information was collected by FFQs and intake estimates were calculated by combining food consumption and food concentration of dioxins , dioxin-like PCBs and non-dioxin-like PCBs .	24 2 243
24071022-4	We used multivariable regression models to estimate the association between dietary intake of dioxins and PCBs and fetal growth .	1 11 112
24071022-5	The contribution of fish and seafood intake during pregnancy was 41% for dietary dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs and 49% for dietary non-dioxin-like PCBs .	
24071022-6	Further stratified analysis by quartiles of seafood intake during pregnancy was conducted .	24 2 243
24071022-7	We found an inverse dose-response association between dietary intake of dioxins and PCBs and fetal growth after adjustment for confounders .	
24071022-8	Newborns of mothers in the upper quartile of dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs intake had 62g lower birth weight ( 95% CI : -73 , -50 ) , 0.26cm shorter birth length ( 95% CI : -0.31 , -0.20 ) and 0.10cm shorter head circumference ( 95% CI : -0.14 , -0.06 ) than newborns of mothers in the lowest quartile of intake .	
24071022-9	Similar negative associations for intake of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs were found after excluding women with intakes above the tolerable weekly intake ( TWI=14pg TEQ/kg bw/week ) .	24 2 243
24071022-10	The negative association of dietary dioxins and PCBs with fetal growth was weaker as seafood intake was increasing .	
24071022-11	No association was found between dietary dioxin and PCB intake and the risk for small-for-gestational age neonate .	
24071022-12	In conclusion , dietary intakes of dioxins and PCBs during pregnancy were negatively associated with fetal growth , even at intakes below the TWI .	
9926427-0	Concentrations of cadmium were determined in the renal cortex and hair of 67 persons who died between 1996 and 1997 in the GdaÅsk region of Poland .	1 123 12 125
9926427-1	The mean concentrations in the renal cortex and the hair were : 39.8 +/- 21.45 micrograms/g and 0.35 +/- 0.33 microgram/g , respectively .	1 12 125
9926427-2	The mean age of the population studied was 47.6 +/- 15.8 years .	
9926427-3	The concentration of cadmium in the renal cortex was age-dependent .	
9926427-4	In the age groups : 18-30 , 31-40 , 41-50 , 51-60 and 61-90 it amounted to : 19.1 +/- 11.0 micrograms/g , 43.3 +/- 21.6 micrograms/g , 47.9 +/- 20.8 micrograms/g , 41.5 +/- 20.4 micrograms/g and 33.6 +/- 18.0 micrograms/g , respectively .	
9926427-5	No correlation between the cadmium contents in the renal cortex and hair has been established .	
9926427-6	Hair is not a good indicator of exposure to cadmium .	
11125683-0	The present study examined the associations between drinking water and urinary arsenic levels and skin lesions among 167 residents of three contiguous villages in Bangladesh .	11 24 12 127 1 2 241 112
11125683-1	Thirty-six ( 21.6% ) had skin lesions ( melanosis , hyperkeratosis , or both ) , of which 13 ( 36.1% ) occurred in subjects who were currently drinking water containing concentrations of arsenic &lt ; 50 micrograms/L .	11 24 1 2 241 112
11125683-2	The risk for skin lesions in relation to the exposure estimates based on urinary arsenic was elevated more than 3-fold , with the odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest quartiles being 3.6 ( 95% confidence interval , 1.2 to 12.1 ) for urinary total arsenic and 3.2 ( 95% confidence interval , 1.1 to 10.0 ) for urinary creatinine-adjusted total arsenic .	1 12 127
11125683-3	The risks for skin lesions in relation to the exposure estimates based on arsenic in drinking water were less strongly elevated , with the odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest quartiles of exposure being 1.7 ( 95% confidence interval , 0.6 to 5.1 ) for drinking-water arsenic and 2.3 for cumulative arsenic index .	24 2 241
11125683-4	The study suggests that arsenic exposure is associated with skin lesions in the Bangladesh population and that urinary arsenic may be a stronger predictor of skin lesions than arsenic in drinking water in this population .	1 12 127
24068199-0	Several studies have examined associations between particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 Âµm or less ( PM2.5 ) and preterm birth , but it is uncertain whether results were affected by individual predispositions ( e.g. , genetic factors , social conditions ) that might vary considerably between women .	
24068199-1	We tested the hypothesis that a woman is at greater risk of preterm delivery when she has had elevated exposure to ambient PM2.5 during a pregnancy than when she has not by comparing pregnancies in the same woman .	11 23 1 2 112 231
24068199-2	From 271,204 births , we selected 29,175 women who had vaginal singleton livebirths at least twice in Connecticut in 2000-2006 ( n = 61,688 births ) .	
24068199-3	Analyses matched pregnancies to the same woman .	
24068199-4	Adjusted odds ratios per interquartile range ( 2.33-Âµg/m(3) ) increase in PM2.5 in the first trimester , second trimester , third trimester , and whole pregnancy were 1.07 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.00 , 1.15 ) , 0.96 ( 95% CI : 0.90 , 1.03 ) , 1.03 ( 95% CI : 0.97 , 1.08 ) , and 1.13 ( 95% CI : 1.01 , 1.28 ) , respectively .	2 231 23
24068199-5	Among Hispanic women , the odds ratio per interquartile range increase in whole-pregnancy exposure was 1.31 ( 95% CI : 1.00 , 1.73 ) .	
24068199-6	Pregnancies with elevated PM2.5 exposure were more likely to result in preterm birth than were other pregnancies to the same woman at lower exposure .	
24068199-7	Associations were most pronounced in the first trimester and among Hispanic women .	
23491026-0	Biomonitoring studies show that humans carry a body burden of multiple classes of contaminants which are not often studied together .	1 12
23491026-1	Many of these chemicals may be hepatotoxic .	
23491026-2	We used the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to evaluate the relationship between alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and 37 environmental contaminants , comprising heavy metals , non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and dioxin-like compounds , using a novel method .	11 1 11123 111 1112
23491026-3	Linear regression models were constructed for each chemical separately , then as a class , using quartiles to represent exposure and adjusting for age , sex , race , income , and BMI .	1 12
23491026-4	We then used an optimization approach to compile a weighted sum of the quartile scores , both within and across chemical classes .	
23491026-5	Using the optimization approach to construct weighted quartile scores , the dioxin like PCB , the non-dioxin like PCB and metal class-level scores were significantly associated with elevated ALT .	
23491026-6	A significant interaction was detected between the class-level score for metals , and the score for non-dioxin-like PCBs .	
23491026-7	When including all chemicals in one model , 3 chemicals accounted for 78% of the weight ( mercury , PCB 180 , 3,3',4,4',5-PNCB ) with the remaining 22% associated with 4 chemicals ( a dioxin and 3 PCBs ) .	
23491026-8	Validation with a holdout dataset indicated that the weighted quartile sum estimator efficiently identifies reproducible significant associations .	
24054544-0	BACKGROUND Quality adjusted life years ( QALYs ) , based on health related quality of life ( HRQL ) , are a commonly used concept in health economics .	
24054544-1	The aim of this study was to apply the concept of QALY to the evaluation of a surveillance program for health related effects of PCB exposure and measure the impact of occupational PCB-exposure on the remaining QALYs of participants .	
24054544-2	METHODS The internal PCB exposure was determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry in plasma .	1 122 12
24054544-3	The HRQOL was assessed via the EQ-5D-3L instrument and combined with the remaining lifetime ( RLE ) at the time point of cessation of exposure .	
24054544-4	For comparative reasons we used both the linear calculation and the complex-number-model from Prieto and Sacristan .	
24054544-5	The impact of several PCB congeners was regressed on the percentage of discounted QALYs on RLE via hierarchical multiple regression , controlling for gender , relational and educational status .	
24054544-6	RESULTS Findings were able to detect a small but significant effect of elevated plasma levels of PCB on QALY for the linear calculation and partially for the complex number calculation .	1 122 12
24054544-7	This means that an internal exposure to PCB reduced HRQOL in the RLE of participants in the surveillance program .	
24054544-8	CONCLUSION QALYs can be applied successfully to monitor HRQL effects in surveillance programs .	
24054544-9	The exposure to a hazardous substance has an influence on QALYs .	
24054544-10	Findings have to be interpreted as a first hint .	
24054544-11	In the following assessment it has to be monitored whether there is an improvement or worsening of HRQL .	
23499217-0	The presence of organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) in biological and environmental samples has been studied for decades in many countries .	
23499217-1	Nonetheless , studies in Latin American countries like Colombia have been scarce .	
23499217-2	Determining the presence of OCPs in breast milk will be of relevance to assess exposures , potential health risks , and for surveillance among Latin American populations .	
23499217-3	Thirty-two breast-feeding mothers were selected to voluntarily participate in the study .	
23499217-4	Breast milk samples were analyzed for 10 OCPs ( Î±- , Î²- , Î³- , Î´-HCH , Heptachlor , Î±- , Î³-Chlordane , 4,4 ' DDT , 4,4 ' DDE , 4,4 ' DDD ) .	1 12 124
23499217-5	Milk samples were analyzed using liquid-liquid extraction , followed by sulfuric acid clean-up , and quantified using GC/Î¼ECD .	1 12 124
23499217-6	Results were confirmed by GC/MS .	
23499217-7	OCPs concentrations were normalized using fat content .	
23499217-8	In all but one sample , 4,4 ' DDE was quantified in concentrations ranging between&lt;17 and 14948 ng g(-1) ( ng of OCP per g of lipids ) , with a mean value of 203 ng g(-1) .	
23499217-9	One woman had 4,4 ' DDE concentrations that were orders of magnitude above the average concentrations observed worldwide .	
23499217-10	Concentrations of 4,4 ' DDE in a second breast milk sample collected in a different time period of lactation from a sub-group of 13 women from the original participants , showed no statistically significant difference with the concentrations found in the first sample .	1 12 124
23499217-11	Based on the results obtained from the Persistent Organic Pollutants Global Monitoring Plan report of 2009 of the Stockholm Convention , Colombia ranks fourth from bottom to top in terms of 4,4 ' DDE average concentrations .	
23501476-0	BACKGROUND Steel production is a major industry worldwide yet there is relatively little information on the pulmonary effects of air quality near steel manufacturing plants .	
23501476-1	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to examine how lung function changes acutely when healthy subjects are situated near a steel plant which is adjacent to a residential area .	
23501476-2	METHODS Sixty-one subjects were randomly assigned to spend 5 consecutive , 8-hour days in a residential neighborhood approximately 0.9km from a steel plant , or approximately 4.5km away at a college campus .	
23501476-3	Subjects crossed-over between sites after a nine-day washout period .	
23501476-4	Lung function was measured daily at both sites along with air pollutants including SO2 , NO2 , O3 , PM2.5 , and ultrafine particles .	11 23 1 2 112 232
23501476-5	Diffusion capacity and pulse oximetry were also examined .	1 11 112
23501476-6	RESULTS Compared with the college site , the forced expiratory volume in 1-second/forced vital capacity , forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC , total lung capacity , functional residual capacity , and residual volume were lower near the steel plant by 0.67% ( 95% CI : 0.28 , 1.06),1.62% ( 95% CI : 0.50 , 2.75 ) , 1.54% ( 95% CI : 0.68 , 2.39 ) , 3.54% ( 95% CI : 1.95 , 5.13 ) and 11.3% ( 95% CI : 4.92 , 17.75 ) , respectively .	1 11 112
23501476-7	Diffusion capacity , forced expiratory volume in 1s , and pulse oximetry were also lower near the plant but these effects were not statistically significant .	1 11 112
23501476-8	Sulfur dioxide , ultrafine particulates , and oxides of nitrogen were greater near the steel plant site compared to the college site .	
23501476-9	CONCLUSIONS Spending short periods of time near a steel plant is associated with a decrease in lung function .	
23507312-0	BACKGROUND Consumption of drinking water with high levels of inorganic arsenic ( over 500 Î¼g/L ) has been associated with type II diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , but previous studies have been inconclusive about risks at lower levels ( &lt;100 Î¼g/L ) .	
23507312-1	We present a case-cohort study based on individual estimates of lifetime arsenic exposure to examine the relationship between chronic low-level arsenic exposure and risk of DM .	
23507312-2	METHODS This case-cohort study included 141 cases of DM diagnosed between 1984 and 1998 as part of the prospective San Luis Valley Diabetes Study .	
23507312-3	A comparison sub-cohort of 488 participants was randomly sampled from 936 eligible participants who were disease free at baseline .	
23507312-4	Individual lifetime arsenic exposure estimates were determined using a methodology that incorporates the use of a structured interview to determine lifetime residence and employment history , geospatial modeling of arsenic concentrations in drinking water , and urine arsenic concentrations .	24 12 1 2 241 127
23507312-5	A Cox proportional hazards model with known DM risk factors as time-dependent covariates was used to assess the association between lifetime exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water and incident DM .	24 2 241
23507312-6	RESULTS Our findings show a significant association between inorganic arsenic exposure and DM risk ( hazard ratio [ HR]=1.27 , 95%=1.01 , 1.59 per 15 Î¼g/L ) while adjusting for ethnicity and time varying covariates age , body mass index and physical activity level .	
23507312-7	CONCLUSIONS Exposure to low-level inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased risk for type II DM in this population based on a comprehensive lifetime exposure assessment .	24 2 241
8907236-0	A Japanese was estimated to ingest 3 and 11 pg/kg/day of TEQ from PCDD/PCDFs and coplanar PCBs respectively through foods .	24 2 243
8907236-1	A Japanese baby was calculated to consume 100-530 pg/kg/day level of TEQ through breast milk feeding , more than 60% being attributed to TEQ of coplanar PCBs .	24 2 243
8907236-2	These intakes of TEQ were compared to the average ( 154 ng/kg/day ) and minimum ( 28 ng/kg/day ) intakes of Yusho , a PCB posioning occurred in Japan in 1968 .	
8907236-3	There are three or four orders of magnitude difference between the daily TEQ intakes of general population and Yusho patients .	
8907236-4	However , the TEQ intakes by breast milk-fed babies of general population are at least 53 times less than the minimum intake of Yusho patients .	
24041736-0	We aimed to characterize levels of polyfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) in indoor dust from offices , homes , and vehicles ; to investigate factors that may affect PFC levels in dust ; and to examine the associations between PFCs in dust and office workers ' serum .	24 12 1 122 2 242
24041736-1	Dust samples were collected in 2009 from offices , homes , and vehicles of 31 individuals in Boston , MA and analyzed for nineteen PFCs , including perfluorooctanoate ( PFOA ) , perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) , fluorotelomer alcohols ( FTOHs ) , and sulfonamidoethanols ( FOSEs ) .	24 2 242
24041736-2	Serum was collected from each participant and analyzed for eight PFCs including PFOA and PFOS .	1 122 12
24041736-3	Perfluorononanoate , PFOA , perfluoroheptanoate , perfluorohexanoate , PFOS and 8:2 FTOH had detection frequencies &gt;50% in dust from all three microenvironments .	
24041736-4	The highest geometric mean concentration in office dust was for 8:2 FTOH ( 309ng/g ) , while PFOS was highest in homes ( 26.9ng/g ) and vehicles ( 15.8ng/g ) .	24 2 242
24041736-5	Overall , offices had the highest PFC concentrations , particularly for longer-chain carboxylic acids and FTOHs .	
24041736-6	Perfluorobutyrate was prevalent in homes and vehicles , but not offices .	
24041736-7	PFOA serum concentrations were not associated with PFC dust levels after adjusting for PFC concentrations in office air .	12 23 1 122 2 232
24041736-8	Dust concentrations of most PFCs are higher in offices than in homes and vehicles .	
24041736-9	However , indoor dust may not be a significant source of exposure to PFCs for office workers .	
24041736-10	This finding suggests that our previously published observation of an association between FTOH concentrations in office air and PFOA concentrations in office workers was not due to confounding by PFCs in dust .	
10991780-0	We assessed levels and determinants of mercury biomarkers among residents of Montreal and surroundings who eat sportfish from the nearby St. Lawrence River .	
10991780-1	Participants were selected from 1118 adult fishers responding to a 1996 screening questionnaire ; the study sample ( n=132 ) overrepresented respondents expected to have the greatest and the least exposure to mercury .	
10991780-2	Tissue mercury concentrations were associated with sportfish consumption : among participants who ate sportfish at least once weekly , hair geometric mean ( GM)=0.82+/-2.54 microg/g and blood mercury GM=3.03+/-2.43 microg/L , compared to hair GM=0.38+/-2.28 microg/g and blood mercury GM=1.44+/-2.23 microg/L for those who ate sportfish less than once weekly .	24 12 1 122 123 243 2
10991780-3	While these levels are somewhat higher than those shown for other Greater Lakes and St. Lawrence River fishers , only one participant surpassed the Canadian recommended population mercury limit of 6 microg/g for hair and 20 microg/L for blood .	1 12 122 123
10991780-4	Consumption of several sportfish species independently explained much of the variation in measured blood mercury ; the predatory species pike was the most important in multivariable regression .	24 12 1 122 2 243
10991780-5	Coincident consumption of waterfowl , fishing during the longer summer/fall rather than the brief winter season , and fishers ' age were independently associated with blood mercury .	1 122 12
10991780-6	Serum selenium related neither to the level of fish consumption nor to the participants ' blood mercury .	24 12 1 122 2 243
24036611-0	BACKGROUND Epidemiologic data regarding the potential neurotoxicity of perfluorinated compounds ( PFCs ) are inconclusive .	
24036611-1	We investigated the associations between in utero exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) and perfluorooctyl sulfonate ( PFOS ) and early childhood neurodevelopment .	1 11 112
24036611-2	METHODS We recruited 239 mother-infant pairs in northern Taiwan from the Taiwan Birth Panel Study , which was established in 2004 .	
24036611-3	We examined the association between PFCs in cord blood and children's neurodevelopment at 2 years of age , using the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers .	11 1 122 12 112
24036611-4	This tool contains cognitive , language , motor , social , and self-help domains ; test scores were further transformed into developmental quotients according to standardized norms .	1 11 112
24036611-5	All multivariate regression models were adjusted for infant sex and gestational age , maternal education , family income , cord blood cotinine levels , postnatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure , and breastfeeding .	1 122 12
24036611-6	RESULTS Prenatal PFOS concentrations in both untransformed and natural log ( Ln)-transformed values were associated with adverse performance on the whole test and the domains related to development .	
24036611-7	A dose-response relationship was observed when PFOS levels were categorized into four groups .	
24036611-8	This association was most obvious in relation to the gross-motor subdomain .	
24036611-9	Across the PFOS interquartile range , the quotients of the gross-motor subdomain decreased by 3.7 points ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = -6.0 to -1.5 ) , with an increasing odds ratio of poor performance ( 2.4 ; 95% CI = 1.3 to 4.2 ) .	
24036611-10	In contrast , measures of association between PFOA concentrations and test scores were close to null .	
24036611-11	CONCLUSIONS Prenatal exposure to PFOS , but not PFOA , may affect children's development , especially gross-motor development at 2 years of age .	
23523155-0	The relative effects of prenatal and postnatal low-level mercury exposure and fish intake on child neurodevelopment are still controversial .	
23523155-1	Limited evidence is available from Mediterranean populations .	
23523155-2	In this prospective study , we measured the Verbal and Performance IQ in Italian children at school-age who were resident in an area declared as a National contaminated site because of mercury pollution , taking into account the possible beneficial effect of fish consumption and potential confounders .	1 11 112
23523155-3	A mother-child cohort made up of 242 children was established at birth in Northeastern Italy in 2001 .	
23523155-4	Their mothers were interviewed approximately 2 months after delivery to determine type , quantity , and origin of fish consumed during pregnancy and about a number of mother , child and family characteristics .	24 2 243
23523155-5	Total mercury ( THg ) and methyl mercury ( MeHg ) were assessed in maternal hair and breast milk and in the child's hair .	1 123 12 124
23523155-6	When children reached 7-9 years of age , 154 ( 63.6% ) parents gave consent to participate in a follow-up evaluation .	
23523155-7	On that occasion , a child's hair sample was collected to determine the current concentration of THg , mothers were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire , and children underwent neuropsychological testing .	11 1 123 12 112
23523155-8	Verbal IQ , performance IQ and full scale IQ were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ( WISC III ) administered by psychologists at school or local health centers .	1 11 112
23523155-9	Demographic , socioeconomic and lifestyle information , medical information of the child's family and the child's dietary habits were collected using a questionnaire filled in by mothers .	24 2 243
23523155-10	Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between prenatal THg exposure through fish consumption of mothers in pregnancy and children's IQ after adjustment for possible confounders such as fish consumption of mothers in pregnancy , child's fish consumption at follow-up , child's birthweight , maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy , house size and property place of residence during pregnancy and gender .	24 2 243
23523155-11	THg in the child's hair at 7 years of age was fairly correlated with THg in maternal hair at delivery ( rs=0.35 ; p&lt;0.0001 ) and was strongly correlated with child's seafood consumption ( rs=0.50 , p&lt;0.0001 ) .	24 12 1 123 243 2
23523155-12	No differences in maternal THg levels were found when comparing children with low or extremely low or high or extremely high scores vs others , considering separately full scale , verbal , and performance IQs .	
23523155-13	Children born from mothers with hair THg levels greater than or equal to 2000ng/g had full scale , verbal and performance IQs which were 4-5 points lower than children born from women with lower THg levels , but these differences were not statistically significant .	
23523155-14	Fresh fish intake of mothers in pregnancy was slightly positively associated with full scale and performance but not so with verbal IQs .	24 2 243
23523155-15	Canned fish showed to be negatively associated with all the outcome variables .	
23523155-16	Unexpectedly , children born to mothers from one town showed IQ scores significantly lower than the other children ; however , none of the many variables considered in these analyses could explain this result .	
23523155-17	The relatively low Hg levels found in the biological samples did not provide evidence of high and extensive Hg exposure in this population .	
23523155-18	Although THg levels in maternal and child's biological samples are correlated with fish consumption , the effects of THg and fish on neurological outcomes go in opposite directions .	
23523155-19	These results do not allow to develop recommendations regarding fish consumption in pregnancy but suggest that keeping THg hair levels&lt;2000ng/g might be desirable .	
8834549-0	Inorganic arsenic ( In-As ) is known to be a human carcinogen , causing lung cancer by inhalation and skin cancer by ingestion .	
8834549-1	Ecologic studies in Taiwan have found a dose-response relation between ingestion of In-As from drinking water and bladder cancer , but questions have been raised concerning the validity and generalizability of the findings .	
8834549-2	Several areas of Argentina have had high exposures to arsenic from naturally contaminated drinking water , particularly the eastern region of the province of CÃ³rdoba .	24 2 241
8834549-3	In this study , we investigated bladder cancer mortality for the years 1986-1991 in CÃ³rdoba's 26 counties , using rates for all of Argentina as the standard for comparison .	
8834549-4	Bladder cancer standardized mortality ratios ( SMRs ) were consistently higher in counties with documented arsenic exposure .	
8834549-5	We grouped counties into low- , medium- , and high-exposure categories ; the corresponding SMRs [ with 95% confidence intervals ( CI) ] were 0.80 ( 95% CI = 0.66-0.96 ) , 1.42 ( 95% CI = 1.14-1.74 ) , and 2.14 ( 95% CI = 1.78-2.53 ) for men , and 1.21 ( 95% CI = 0.85-1.64 ) , 1.58 ( 95% CI = 1.01-2.35 ) , and 1.82 ( 95% CI = 1.19-2.64 ) for women .	
8834549-6	The clear trends found in a population with different genetic composition and a high-protein diet support the findings in Taiwan .	
10903622-0	Chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with a range of neurologic , vascular , dermatologic , and carcinogenic effects .	
10903622-1	However , limited research has been directed at the association of arsenic exposure and human reproductive health outcomes .	
10903622-2	The principal aim of this study was to investigate the trends in infant mortality between two geographic locations in Chile : Antofagasta , which has a well-documented history of arsenic exposure from naturally contaminated water , and ValparaÃ­so , a comparable low-exposure city .	
10903622-3	The arsenic concentration in Antofagasta's public drinking water supply rose substantially in 1958 with the introduction of a new water source , and remained elevated until 1970 .	24 2 241
10903622-4	We used a retrospective study design to examine time and location patterns in infant mortality between 1950 and 1996 , using univariate statistics , graphical techniques , and Poisson regression analysis .	
10903622-5	Results of the study document the general declines in late fetal and infant mortality over the study period in both locations .	
10903622-6	The data also indicate an elevation of the late fetal , neonatal , and postneonatal mortality rates for Antofagasta , relative to ValparaÃ­so , for specific time periods , which generally coincide with the period of highest arsenic concentration in the drinking water of Antofagasta .	24 2 241
10903622-7	Poisson regression analysis yielded an elevated and significant association between arsenic exposure and late fetal mortality [ rate ratio ( RR ) = 1.7 ; 95% confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.5-1.9 ] , neonatal mortality ( RR = 1.53 ; CI , 1.4-1.7 ) , and postneonatal mortality ( RR = 1.26 ; CI , 1.2-1.3 ) after adjustment for location and calendar time .	1 11 112
10903622-8	The findings from this investigation may support a role for arsenic exposure in increasing the risk of late fetal and infant mortality .	
24036609-0	BACKGROUND Millions of people worldwide are exposed to arsenic in drinking water , and many are likely coexposed to other agents that could substantially increase their risks of arsenic-related cancer .	
24036609-1	METHODS We performed a case-control study of multiple chemical exposures in 538 lung and bladder cancer cases and 640 controls in northern Chile , an area with formerly high drinking water arsenic concentrations .	24 2 241
24036609-2	Detailed information was collected on lifetime arsenic exposure , smoking , secondhand smoke , and other known or suspected carcinogens , including asbestos , silica , and wood dust .	24 2 241
24036609-3	RESULTS Very high lung and bladder cancer odds ratios ( ORs ) , and evidence of greater than additive effects , were seen in people exposed to arsenic concentrations &gt;335 Âµg/L and who were tobacco smokers ( OR = 16 , 95% confidence interval = 6.5-40 for lung cancer ; and OR = 23 [ 8.2-66 ] for bladder cancer ; Rothman Synergy Indices = 4.0 [ 1.7-9.4 ] and 2.0 [ 0.92-4.5 ] , respectively ) .	24 2 241
24036609-4	Evidence of greater than additive effects were also seen in people coexposed to arsenic and secondhand tobacco smoke and several other known or suspected carcinogens , including asbestos , silica , and wood dust .	
24036609-5	CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that people coexposed to arsenic and other known or suspected carcinogens have very high risks of lung or bladder cancer .	
10903614-0	It has been suggested that the indigenous AtacameÃ±o people in Northern Chile might be protected from the health effects of arsenic in drinking water because of many centuries of exposure .	
10903614-1	Here we report on the first intensive investigation of arsenic-induced skin lesions in this population .	
10903614-2	We selected 11 families ( 44 participants ) from the village of Chiu Chiu , which is supplied with water containing between 750 and 800 microg/L inorganic arsenic .	24 2 241
10903614-3	For comparison , 8 families ( 31 participants ) were also selected from a village where the water contains approximately 10 microg/L inorganic arsenic .	24 2 241
10903614-4	After being transported to the nearest city for blind assessment , participants were examined by four physicians with experience in studying arsenic-induced lesions .	
10903614-5	Four of the six men from the exposed village , who had been drinking the contaminated water for more than 20 years , were diagnosed with skin lesions due to arsenic , but none of the women had definite lesions .	11 24 1 2 241 112
10903614-6	A 13-year-old girl had definite skin pigmentation changes due to arsenic , and a 19-year-old boy had both pigmentation changes and keratoses on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet .	1 11 112
10903614-7	Family interviews identified a wide range of fruits and vegetables consumed daily by the affected participants , as well as the weekly intake of red meat and chicken .	
10903614-8	However , the prevalence of skin lesions among men and children in the small population studied was similar to that reported with corresponding arsenic drinking water concentrations in both Taiwan and West Bengal , India--populations in which extensive malnutrition has been thought to increase susceptibility .	
23537601-0	The aim of the present study was to examine the body burden of lead ( Pb ) , mercury ( Hg ) , and cadmium ( Cd ) in blood among Swedish adults and the association between blood levels , diet and other lifestyle factors .	1 122 12
23537601-1	The study was based on a subgroup ( n=273 ) of the national survey Riksmaten 2010-2011 ( 4-day food records and questionnaire ) .	
23537601-2	Lead , Hg , and Cd were measured in whole blood , and Cd additionally in urine , by mass or fluorescence spectrometry methods .	1 122 12 127
23537601-3	The median values ( 5-95th percentiles ) of the metals in blood were as follows ; Pb : 13.4 ( 5.8-28.6 ) Î¼g/L , Hg : 1.13 ( 0.31-3.45 ) Î¼g/L , and Cd : 0.19 ( 0.09-1.08 ) Î¼g/L .	
23537601-4	All three metals increased with increasing age .	
23537601-5	Lead levels in blood were positively associated with intakes of game and alcohol , Hg was related to fish intake , and blood Cd related to smoking and low iron stores and to a low meat intake .	24 12 1 122 2 243
23537601-6	Body burdens of the studied metals were generally below health based reference values , but several individuals had blood Pb levels above the reference point for possible nephrotoxic and developmental neurotoxic effects .	
23537601-7	As health effects cannot be excluded , individuals with high Pb exposure should aim at decreasing their body burden , both from food and from other exposure routes .	
24034783-0	BACKGROUND There is limited research examining the relationship between lead ( Pb ) exposure and medically diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) in children .	
24034783-1	The role of mercury ( Hg ) and cadmium ( Cd ) exposures in ADHD development is even less clear .	
24034783-2	OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between Pb , Hg , and Cd and ADHD in children living inside and outside a Lead Investigation Area ( LIA ) of a former lead refinery in Omaha , NE .	1 122 12
24034783-3	METHODS We carried out a case-control study with 71 currently medically diagnosed ADHD cases and 58 controls from a psychiatric clinic and a pediatric clinic inside and outside of the LIA .	
24034783-4	The participants were matched on age group ( 5-8 , 9-12 years ) , sex , race ( African American or Caucasians and others ) , and location ( inside or outside LIA ) .	
24034783-5	We measured whole blood Pb , total Hg , and Cd using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .	1 122 12
24034783-6	RESULTS Inside the LIA , the 27 cases had blood Pb geometric mean ( GM ) 1.89 Âµg/dL and the 41 controls had 1.51 Âµg/dL .	1 122 12
24034783-7	Outside the LIA , the 44 cases had blood Pb GM 1.02 Âµg/dL while the 17 controls had 0.97 Âµg/dL .	
24034783-8	After adjustment for matching variables and maternal smoking , socioeconomic status , and environmental tobacco exposure , each natural log unit blood Pb had an odds ratio of 2.52 with 95% confidence interval of 1.07-5.92 .	
24034783-9	Stratification by the LIA indicated similar point estimate but wider CIs .	
24034783-10	No associations were observed for Hg or Cd .	
24034783-11	CONCLUSIONS Postnatal Pb exposure may be associated with higher risk of clinical ADHD , but not the postnatal exposure to Hg or Cd .	
23542682-0	Bisphenol A ( BPA ) exposure during early life may have endocrine-disrupting effects , but the dietary and sociodemographic predictors of BPA exposure during pregnancy and childhood remain unclear .	
23542682-1	Our aim was to evaluate the correlations between , and sociodemographic and dietary predictors of , serial urinary BPA concentrations measured during pregnancy and childhood in a Spanish birth cohort study .	1 12 127
23542682-2	BPA was measured in two spot urine samples collected from 479 women during the first and third trimester of pregnancy and in one urine sample from their 4-year old children ( n=130 ) .	1 12 127
23542682-3	Average dietary intakes were reported in food frequency questionnaires during the first and third pregnancy trimester and at age 4years .	24 2 243
23542682-4	Multivariate mixed models and linear regression models were used to estimate associations between sociodemographic and dietary factors and BPA concentrations .	
23542682-5	A small , but statistically significant correlation was found between serial maternal BPA concentrations measured during pregnancy ( r=0.17 ) .	
23542682-6	Pregnant women who were younger , less-educated , smoked , and who were exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke ( SHS ) had higher BPA concentrations than others .	
23542682-7	BPA concentrations were also higher in children exposed to SHS .	
23542682-8	High consumption of canned fish during pregnancy was associated with 21% [ GM ratio=1.21 ; 95%CI 1.02 , 1.44 ] and 25% [ GM ratio=1.25 ; 95%CI 1.05 , 1.49 ] higher urinary BPA concentrations in the first and third pregnancy trimester , respectively , compared to the lowest consumption group .	24 2 243
23542682-9	This study suggests that canned fish may be a major source of BPA during pregnancy in Spain , a country of high canned fish consumption .	
23542682-10	Further evaluation of specific BPA exposure sources in the sociodemographic group of younger women who smoke , are exposed to SHS , and have a low educational level is needed .	
23542682-11	Studies identifying sources of exposure would benefit from repeat BPA measurements and questionnaires specifically focused on dietary and packaging sources .	
8653383-0	Samples of unpasteurised bulked milk , taken directly from ten herds of dairy cattle on rural and urban farms in the north west of England on five separate sampling occasions , were analysed for a range of PCB congeners .	
8653383-1	Sigma PCB concentrations ( sum of 37 congeners ) ranged from 3.4-16.4 ng/g milk fat with a mean sigma PCB concentration of 8.4 ng/g milk fat .	
8653383-2	The dominating congeners were 118 , 153 , 138 and 180 , which contributed 15% , 20% , 17% and 9% of the sigma PCB load respectively .	
8653383-3	The chlorine pattern of the congeners which made moderate or major contributions to the sigma PCB concentration were typically substituted at both para positions ( 4,4' ) , while the PCB congeners not detected in the milk had at least one ring that was not 4-substituted .	
8653383-4	These results indicate the 4,4 ' substitution pattern as being the key to PCB persistence in cows .	
8653383-5	It is estimated that consumption of typical daily intakes of milk with the PCB concentrations measured in this study would contribute 11% of the average daily sigma PCB intake for individuals in the UK .	24 2 243
8653383-6	This contribution would increase to 30% when exposure through the consumption of dairy products prepared from such milk ( e.g. cheese , butter ) is taken into account .	24 2 243
8653383-7	It is estimated that the inclusion of the TEF assigned PCBs would typically increase the TEQ rating of cows ' milk by approximately 40% over that attributed to PCDD/Fs alone .	
8793350-0	Methylation is considered the detoxification pathway for inorganic arsenic ( InAs ) , an established human carcinogen .	
8793350-1	Urinary speciation analysis is used to assess the distribution of metabolites [ monomethylarsonate ( MMA ) , dimethylarsinate ( DMA ) , and unmethylated arsenic ( InAs) ] , as indicators of methylation capacity .	1111 1 111 11
8793350-2	We conducted a large biomarker study in northern Chile of a population chronically exposed to high levels of arsenic in drinking water .	24 2 241
8793350-3	We report the results of the methylation study , which focused on the effects of exposure and other variables on the percent InAs , MMA , DMA , and the ratio of MMA to DMA in urine .	1 12 127
8793350-4	The study consisted of 122 people in a town with arsenic water levels around 600 micrograms/l and 98 participants in a neighboring town with arsenic levels in water of about 15 micrograms/l .	24 2 241
8793350-5	The corresponding mean urinary arsenic levels were 580 micrograms/l and 60 micrograms/l , of which 18.4% and 14.9% were InAs , respectively .	1 12 127
8793350-6	The main differences were found for MMA:DMA ; exposure , smoking , and being male were associated with higher MMA:DMA , while longer residence , AtacameÃ±o ethnicity , and being female were associated with lower MMA:DMA .	
8793350-7	Together , these variables explained about 30% of the variability in MMA:DMA .	
8793350-8	Overall , there was no evidence of a threshold for methylation capacity , even at very high exposures , and the interindividual differences were within a much wider range than those attributed to the variables investigated .	
8793350-9	The differences in percent InAs were small and within the ranges of other studies of background exposure levels .	
8793350-10	The biological significance of MMA:DMA , which was more than 1.5 times greater in the exposed group , and its relationship to sex , length of exposure , and ethnicity need further investigation because its relevance to health risk is not clear .	
10898392-0	Human primary teeth have been used as indicators of heavy metal exposure for several decades , but the knowledge about the influence of factors such as tooth type and the presence of caries and roots on metal concentrations is limited .	
10898392-1	Samples of tooth powder from more than 1200 Norwegian primary teeth without fillings have been analyzed for lead , zinc and cadmium content , and 554 of them for mercury .	1 12 125
10898392-2	The material represents all groups of tooth types ( incisors , canines and molars ) , carious and non-carious teeth , and teeth with and without roots .	1 12 125
10898392-3	Here we investigate how tooth group and the presence of caries and roots are related to metal concentrations in the teeth .	1 12 125
10898392-4	We find that carious teeth have higher metal concentrations than non-carious teeth ; the difference was statistically significant for lead , mercury and zinc .	
10898392-5	Teeth with roots have higher lead and zinc concentrations than teeth without roots .	
10898392-6	We find differences in metal concentrations between the tooth groups for lead , mercury and zinc .	1 12 125
10898392-7	Significant , positive correlations are found between lead and the three other metals and between mercury and zinc .	
10898392-8	We conclude that metal concentrations in primary teeth are affected by the presence of caries and roots and by tooth group .	1 12 125
24029725-0	DINCH ( diisononylcyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate ) was introduced into the world market in 2002 as a non-aromatic plasticizer and phthalate substitute .	
24029725-1	We analyzed 300 urine samples ( 24h voids ) of the German Environmental Specimen Bank ( ESB for Human tissues , ESB Hum ) for specific DINCH metabolites by on-line HPLC-MS/MS with isotope dilution quantification .	1 12 127
24029725-2	Urine samples of the ESB Hum were from the years 1999 , 2003 , 2006 , 2009 and 2012 , chosen to investigate the appearance and a possible trend of DINCH exposure since its market introduction .	1 12 127
24029725-3	No DINCH metabolites were detected in the 1999 and 2003 samples .	
24029725-4	From 2006 on , the percentage of samples with DINCH metabolites above the LOQ increased significantly over the years ( 7% in 2006 , 43% in 2009 and 98% in 2012 ) .	
24029725-5	The cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono(hydroxy-isononyl) ester ( OH-MINCH ) was the predominant metabolite .	
24029725-6	Median ( and 95th percentile ) concentrations ( in Î¼g/l ) increased from &lt;LOQ ( 0.09 ) in 2006 , to &lt;LOQ ( 1.02 ) in 2009 to 0.39 ( 2.09 ) in 2012 .	
24029725-7	All oxidized DINCH metabolites ( OH-MINCH , cx-MINCH , oxo-MINCH ) correlated strongly among each other ( Ï&gt;0.75 , p&lt;0.001 ) .	
24029725-8	The median ( 95th percentile ) DINCH intake in 2012 was calculated to be 0.14 ( 1.07)Î¼g/kg body weight/day which is considerably below daily intakes currently deemed tolerable .	24 2 243
24029725-9	DINCH is regarded to have a preferred toxicological profile over certain anti-androgenic phthalates .	
24029725-10	The continuation of DINCH measurements in the ESB Hum and other human biomonitoring studies like the German Environmental Survey ( GerES ) allows tracking the development of DINCH body burdens , the distribution of exposure levels and daily intakes , providing basic data for future toxicological assessment and further epidemiological studies .	
10874659-0	The main objective of this study was to analyze the risks associated with occupational exposures in an industrializing country where lung cancer is the primary neoplastic cause of death in men .	
10874659-1	A full occupational history was collected through interviewing 199 men with lung cancer and 393 control subjects .	
10874659-2	Exposure to arsenic , asbestos , chromium , dust , nickel , and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons was assessed by means of a job-exposure matrix .	2 21
10874659-3	Elevated odds ratios were observed for employment in the alcoholic beverages industry ( 5.2 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.1 to 23.1 ) , sawmills and wood mills ( 4.8 ; 95% CI , 1.2 to 19.0 ) , water transport ( 3.3 ; 95% CI , 1.1 to 12.1 ) , and chemicals/plastics manufacturers ( 1.9 ; 95% CI , 1.1 to 3.3 ) .	
10874659-4	A small , non-significant increased risk was observed after long-term exposure to arsenic and chromium , with a dose-response for chromium .	
10874659-5	Although some of the present results may result from chance , most are consistent with those of previous investigations in other countries .	
24028800-0	The role of the placenta was assessed by comparing the profiles of methylmercury ( MeHg ) , inorganic mercury ( I-Hg ) , lead ( Pb ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , selenium ( Se ) , zinc ( Zn ) , and copper ( Cu ) in freeze-dried chorionic tissue of the placenta and umbilical cord tissue .	1 122 12 126
24028800-1	The significance of the placenta and cord tissue as predictors of prenatal exposure to these trace elements in pregnant women and newborns was also examined by comparing the element profiles among placenta and cord tissue , and maternal and cord blood red blood cells ( RBCs ) .	
24028800-2	The samples were collected from 48 mother-child pairs at birth in the general population of Japanese .	
24028800-3	The concentrations of all elements , except for MeHg , were significantly higher in placenta than in cord tissue .	
24028800-4	In particular , the Cd showed the highest placenta vs. cord tissue ratio ( 59:1 ) , followed by I-Hg ( 2.4:1 ) , indicating that the placental barrier works most strongly against Cd among the examined toxic elements .	
24028800-5	Contrary to the other elements , the MeHg concentration in cord tissue was significantly higher ( 1.6 times ) than that in placenta , indicating its exceptionally high placental transfer .	1 122 12
24028800-6	The MeHg in placenta showed significant correlations with total mercury ( T-Hg ) in maternal and cord RBCs ( rs=0.80 and 0.91 , respectively ) .	
24028800-7	The MeHg in cord tissue also showed significant correlations with T-Hg in maternal and cord RBCs ( rs=0.75 and 0.85 , respectively ) .	
24028800-8	Therefore , both placenta and cord tissue are useful for predicting maternal and fetal exposure to MeHg .	
24028800-9	The Se concentration in placenta showed significant but moderate correlations with that in maternal and cord RBCs ( rs=0.38 and 0.57 , respectively ) .	
24028800-10	The Pb , Zn , and Cu concentrations in placenta and cord tissue showed no significant correlations with those in maternal and cord RBCs .	1 12 126
24028800-11	As an exception , the Cd concentration in placenta showed a moderate but significant correlation ( rs=0.41 ) with that in maternal RBCs , suggesting that the placenta is useful for predicting maternal exposure to Cd during gestation .	
23552396-0	BACKGROUND Altered DNA methylation has been associated with various diseases .	
23552396-1	OBJECTIVE We evaluated the association between levels of methylation in leukocyte DNA at long interspersed nuclear element 1 ( LINE-1 ) and genetic and non-genetic characteristics of 892 control participants from the Spanish Bladder Cancer/EPICURO study .	1111 1 111 11
23552396-2	METHODS We determined LINE-1 methylation levels by pyrosequencing .	1111 1 111 11
23552396-3	Individual data included demographics , smoking status , nutrient intake , toenail concentrations of 12 trace elements , xenobiotic metabolism gene variants , and 515 polymorphisms among 24 genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway .	1 123 12
23552396-4	To assess the association between LINE-1 methylation levels ( percentage of methylated cytosines ) and potential determinants , we estimated beta coefficients ( Î²s ) by robust linear regression .	
23552396-5	RESULTS Women had lower levels of LINE-1 methylation than men ( Î² = -0.7 , p = 0.02 ) .	
23552396-6	Persons who smoked blond tobacco showed lower methylation than nonsmokers ( Î² = -0.7 , p = 0.03 ) .	
23552396-7	Arsenic toenail concentration was inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation ( Î² = -3.6 , p = 0.003 ) .	
23552396-8	By contrast , iron ( Î² = 0.002 , p = 0.009 ) and nickel ( Î² = 0.02 , p = 0.004 ) were positively associated with LINE-1 methylation .	
23552396-9	Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in DNMT3A ( rs7581217-per allele , Î² = 0.3 , p = 0.002 ) , TCN2 ( rs9606756-GG , Î² = 1.9 , p = 0.008 ; rs4820887-AA , Î² = 4.0 , p = 4.8 Ã 10-7 ; rs9621049-TT , Î² = 4.2 , p = 4.7 Ã 10-9 ) , AS3MT ( rs7085104-GG , Î² = 0.7 , p = 0.001 ) , SLC19A1 ( rs914238 , TC vs. TT : Î² = 0.5 and CC vs. TT : Î² = -0.3 , global p = 0.0007 ) and MTHFS ( rs1380642 , CT vs. CC : Î² = 0.3 and TT vs. CC ; Î² = -0.8 , global p = 0.05 ) were associated with LINE-1 methylation .	
23552396-10	CONCLUSIONS We identified several characteristics , environmental factors , and common genetic variants that predicted DNA methylation among study participants .	1111 1 111 11
24028648-0	BACKGROUND In Spain , few studies have evaluated prenatal exposure to heavy metals .	
24028648-1	The objective of this study was to describe lead , mercury and cadmium concentrations in blood from a sample of newborn-mother-father trios , as well as to investigate the association between metals in cord blood and parental variables .	1 122 12
24028648-2	We also explored the relationship between cord blood metal concentrations and child characteristics at birth .	1 122 12
24028648-3	METHODS Metal correlations among family members were assessed using Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient .	
24028648-4	Linear regression was used to explore the association between parental variables and log-transformed cord blood lead and cord blood mercury concentrations .	1 122 12
24028648-5	In the case of cadmium , tobit regression was used due to the existence of samples below the detection limit .	
24028648-6	The association between cord blood metal concentrations and child characteristics at birth was evaluated using linear regression .	
24028648-7	RESULTS Geometric means for lead , mercury and cadmium were 14.09Î¼g/L , 6.72Î¼g/L and 0.27Î¼g/L in newborns ; 19.80Î¼g/L , 3.90Î¼g/L and 0.53Î¼g/L in pregnant women ; and 33.00Î¼g/L , 5.38Î¼g/L and 0.49Î¼g/L in men .	1 122 12
24028648-8	Positive correlations were found between metal concentrations among members of the trio .	
24028648-9	Lead and cadmium concentrations were 15% and 22% higher in newborns from mothers who smoked during pregnancy , while mercury concentrations were 25% higher in newborns from mothers with greater fish intake .	24 2 232 243 23
24028648-10	Cord-blood lead levels showed seasonal periodicity , with lower concentrations observed in winter .	1 122 12
24028648-11	Cord blood cadmium concentrations over 0.29Î¼g/L were associated with lower 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores .	1 11 112
24028648-12	CONCLUSIONS These results reinforce the need to establish biomonitoring programs in Spain , and provide support for tobacco smoke and fish consumption as important preventable sources of heavy metal exposure in newborns .	24 2 232 243 23
24028648-13	Additionally , our findings support the hypothesis that cadmium exposure might be deleterious to fetal development .	1 11 112
10856023-0	To help address the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 , a physically based probabilistic model has been developed to quantify and analyze dermal and nondietary ingestion exposure and dose to pesticides .	24 244 2 22
10856023-1	The Residential Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Model for Pesticides ( Residential-SHEDS ) simulates the exposures and doses of children contacting residues on surfaces in treated residences and on turf in treated residential yards .	
10856023-2	The simulations combine sequential time-location-activity information from children's diaries with microlevel videotaped activity data , probability distributions of measured surface residues and exposure factors , and pharmacokinetic rate constants .	
10856023-3	Model outputs include individual profiles and population statistics for daily dermal loading , mass in the blood compartment , ingested residue via nondietary objects , and mass of eliminated metabolite , as well as contributions from various routes , pathways , and media .	24 2 22
10856023-4	To illustrate the capabilities of the model framework , we applied Residential-SHEDS to estimate children's residential exposure and dose to chlorpyrifos for 12 exposure scenarios : 2 age groups ( 0-4 and 5-9 years ) ; 2 indoor pesticide application methods ( broadcast and crack and crevice ) ; and 3 postindoor application time periods ( &lt ; 1 , 1-7 , and 8-30 days ) .	24 244 2
10856023-5	Independent residential turf applications ( liquid or granular ) were included in each of these scenarios .	
10856023-6	Despite the current data limitations and model assumptions , the case study predicts exposure and dose estimates that compare well to measurements in the published literature , and provides insights to the relative importance of exposure scenarios and pathways .	2
8837684-0	Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs ) were examined in 49 workers employed in a printing press , who were occupationally exposed to low concentrations of toluene for an average of 20.3 years , and in 59 subjects in a control group .	11 12 112 1 122 127
8837684-1	In the group of exposed workers , a significant decrease was found in all wave amplitudes examined , a significant prolongation of P1 wave latency , and an increased interval of interpeak latencies ( P3-P5 ) , indicating that the extramedullary and high medullary part of the auditory pathway are biologically most frequently affected by chronic exposure to low concentrations of toluene .	
8837684-2	The level of exposure to toluene in both groups was evaluated by defining the concentration of toluene in peripheral blood and the concentration of hippuric acid and ortho-cresol in urine .	1 122 12 127
23562393-0	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Major risk factors for congestive heart failure ( CHF ) are myocardial infarction , hypertension , diabetes , atrial fibrillation , smoking , left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) and obesity .	
23562393-1	However , since these risk factors only explain part of the risk of CHF , we investigated whether persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) might also play a role .	
23562393-2	METHODS In the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors ( PIVUS ) study , left ventricular ejection fraction , ( EF ) , E/A-ratio and isovolumic relaxation time ( IVRT ) , were determined by echocardiography and serum samples of 21 POPs were analyzed in serum measured by high-resolution chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry ( HRGC/HRMS ) in 998 subjects all aged 70 years .	11 1 122 12 112
23562393-3	RESULTS In this cross-sectional analysis , high levels of several of the polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB congeners 99 , 118 , 105 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( OCDD ) were significantly related to a decreased EF .	
23562393-4	Some POPs were also related to a decreased E/A-ratio ( PCBs 206 and 209 ) .	
23562393-5	All the results were adjusted for gender , hypertension , diabetes , smoking , LVH and BMI , and subjects with myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation were excluded from the analysis .	
23562393-6	CONCLUSIONS Circulating levels of POPs were related to impairments in both left ventricular systolic and diastolic function independently of major congestive heart failure risk factors , suggesting a possible role of POPs in heart failure .	
10791564-0	The relation between trace element levels in drinking water and cognitive function was investigated in a population-based study of elderly residents ( n = 1,016 ) in rural China in 1996-1997 .	11 24 1 2 241 112
10791564-1	Cognitive function was measured using a Chinese translation of the Community Screening Interview for Dementia .	
10791564-2	A mixed effects model was used to evaluate the effect of each of the elements on cognitive function while adjusting for age , sex , and educational level .	
10791564-3	Several of the elements examined had a significant effect on cognitive function when they were assessed in a univariate context .	
10791564-4	However , after adjustment for other elements , many of these results were not significant .	
10791564-5	There was a significant quadratic effect for calcium and a significant zinc-cadmium interaction .	
10791564-6	Cognitive function increased with calcium level up to a certain point and then decreased as calcium continued to increase .	1 11 112
10791564-7	Zinc showed a positive relation with cognitive function at low cadmium levels but a negative relation at high levels .	
8677430-0	The carcinogenic potential of cadmium might be affected by several factors such as smoking , hormones and presence of other metals , such as selenium and zinc .	
8677430-1	Cadmium was analyzed in breast-fat tissue of 43 breast cancer patients and 32 healthy control subjects .	1 12 125
8677430-2	Patients were thoroughly characterized according to such variables as stage of cancer , smoking habits , and number of children .	
8677430-3	Correlation of cadmium levels with these variables , with hormone receptors , and with previously reported selenium and zinc were all analyzed .	
8677430-4	The mean cadmium concentration found in breast cancer patients ( 20.4 +/- 17.5 micrograms/g ) did not differ significantly from that of the healthy controls ( 31.7 +/- 39.4 micrograms/g ) .	
8677430-5	However , unexpectedly high concentrations of cadmium ( 3.2-86.9 vs. 0.1-160.4 micrograms/g ) were found in breast samples , which may indicate that cadmium binding proteins exist in human breast tissue .	1 12 125
8677430-6	Correlation of cadmium with smoking rate of cancer patients was positive ( Rs = 0.0505 , p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
8677430-7	Correlation of cadmium with estrogen receptors in breast cancer was suggestive ( Rs = 0.309 , 28 cases , P = 0.06 ) .	
8677430-8	No correlation was found with other trace elements such as selenium , zinc and copper .	
8677430-9	These results seem neither to prove nor to disprove the role of cadmium in breast cancer initiation , promotion or progression .	
24013022-0	Perfluoroalkyl acids ( PFAAs ) are persistent organic pollutants that are used in a wide range of consumer products .	
24013022-1	Recent epidemiological studies have shown that prenatal exposure to toxic levels of PFAAs in the environment may adversely affect fetal growth and humoral immune response in infants and children .	
24013022-2	Here we have characterized levels of prenatal exposure to PFAA between 2003 and 2011 in Hokkaido , Japan , by measuring PFAA concentrations in plasma samples from pregnant women .	1 122 12
24013022-3	The study population comprised 150 women who enrolled in a prospective birth cohort study conducted in Hokkaido .	
24013022-4	Eleven PFAAs were measured in maternal plasma samples using simultaneous analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry .	1 122 12
24013022-5	At the end of the study , in 2011 , age- and parity-adjusted mean concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , perfluorononanoic acid ( PFNA ) , perfluorodecanoic acid ( PFDA ) , perfluoroundecanoic acid ( PFUnDA ) , perfluorododecanoic acid ( PFDoDA ) , perfluorotridecanoic acid ( PFTrDA ) , perfluorohexane sulfonate ( PFHxS ) , and perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS ) were 1.35ng/mL , 1.26ng/mL , 0.66ng/mL , 1.29ng/mL , 0.25ng/mL , 0.33ng/mL , 0.28ng/mL , and 3.86ng/mL , respectively .	
24013022-6	Whereas PFOS and PFOA concentrations declined 8.4%/y and 3.1%/y , respectively , PFNA and PFDA levels increased 4.7%/y and 2.4%/y , respectively , between 2003 and 2011 .	
24013022-7	PFUnDA , PFDoDA , and PFTrDA were detected in the vast majority of maternal samples , but no significant temporal trend was apparent .	
24013022-8	Future studies must involve a larger population of pregnant women and their children to determine the effects of prenatal exposure to PFAA on health outcomes in infants and children .	
23575356-0	BACKGROUND Numerous studies have examined the association between heavy metal contamination ( including arsenic [ As ] , cadmium [ Cd ] , chromium [ Cr ] , copper [ Cu ] , mercury [ Hg ] , nickel [ Ni ] , lead [ Pb ] , and zinc [ Zn] ) and lung cancer .	
23575356-1	However , data from previous studies on pathological cell types are limited , particularly regarding exposure to low-dose soil heavy metal contamination .	
23575356-2	The purpose of this study was to explore the association between soil heavy metal contamination and lung cancer incidence by specific cell type in Taiwan .	245 24 2
23575356-3	METHODS We conducted an ecological study and calculated the annual averages of eight soil heavy metals ( i.e. , As , Cd , Cr , Cu , Hg , Ni , Pb , and Zn ) by using data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration from1982 to 1986 .	245 24 2
23575356-4	The age-standardized incidence rates of lung cancer according to two major pathological types ( adenocarcinoma [ AC ] and squamous cell carcinoma [ SCC] ) were obtained from the National Cancer Registry Program conducted in Taiwan from 2001 to 2005 .	
23575356-5	A geographical information system was used to plot the maps of soil heavy metal concentration and lung cancer incidence rates .	245 24 2
23575356-6	Poisson regression models were used to obtain the adjusted relative ratios ( RR ) and 95% confidence intervals ( CI ) for the lung cancer incidence associated with soil heavy metals .	
23575356-7	RESULTS For males , the trend test for lung SCC incidence caused by exposure to Cr , Cu , Hg , Ni , and Zn showed a statistically significant dose-response relationship .	
23575356-8	However , for lung AC , only Cu and Ni had a significant dose-response relationship .	
23575356-9	As for females , those achieving a statistically significant dose-response relationship for the trend test were Cr ( P = 0.02 ) , Ni ( P = 0.02 ) , and Zn ( P= 0.02 ) for lung SCC , and Cu ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) and Zn ( P = 0.02 ) for lung AC .	
23575356-10	CONCLUSION The current study suggests that a dose-response relationship exists between low-dose soil heavy metal concentration and lung cancer occurrence by specific cell-type ; however , the relevant mechanism should be explored further .	
8810088-0	Urinary mercury levels and excretion rates were measured to determine the effect of dental amalgam restoration on the mercury body burden .	24 244 2
8810088-1	No consistent increase in urinary mercury concentrations was found among subjects who had a single restoration , but a continuously increasing statistically significant ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) trend , that was 33% above background levels , was detected between 9 and 12 days after restoration , in the subject with four restorations in a single day .	1 12 127
8810088-2	The current findings suggested that even though amalgam restorations can cause an increase in mercury body burden , the elevation above background levels is small and thus the risks associated with the use of this material are considered minimal for the general population .	
8856955-0	The concentrations of persistent organochlorine contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , DDT ( its isomers and metabolites ) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) and isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) have been determined in human milk samples from the three regions in the Czech Republic .	1 12 124
8856955-1	Results were generated by the congener-specific analyses ( two-dimensional high resolution gas chromatography ) .	
8856955-2	The results are compared with the similar studies from other industrial countries ( Norway , Great Britain , the Netherlands and Germany ) .	
8856955-3	Typical patterns of major PCBs contained in analyzed breast milk samples are presented .	1 12 124
8856955-4	PCB No.153 was the dominant congener in all the samples .	
8856955-5	A good correlation was found between the sum of PCBs and PCB No.:153 ( r = 0.99 ) , constitutes approx. 30% of calculated PCBs content .	
10417365-0	Urinary arsenic ( As ) concentrations were evaluated as a biomarker of exposure in a U.S. population chronically exposed to inorganic As ( InAs ) in their drinking water .	1 12
10417365-1	Ninety-six individuals who consumed drinking water with As concentrations of 8-620 microg/L provided first morning urine voids for up to 5 consecutive days .	1 12 127
10417365-2	The study population was 56% male , and 44% was younger than 18 years of age .	
10417365-3	On one day of the study period , all voided urines were collected over a 24-hr period .	1 12 127
10417365-4	Arsenic intake from drinking water was estimated from daily food diaries .	24 2 241
10417365-5	Comparison between the concentration of As in individual urine voids with that in the 24-hr urine collection indicated that the concentration of As in urine was stable throughout the day .	1 12 127
10417365-6	Comparison of the concentration of As in each first morning urine void over the 5-day study period indicated that there was little day-to-day variation in the concentration of As in urine .	1 12 127
10417365-7	The concentration of As in drinking water was a better predictor of the concentration of As in urine than was the estimated intake of As from drinking water .	24 12 1 2 241 127
10417365-8	The concentration of As in urine did not vary by gender .	1 12 127
10417365-9	An age-dependent difference in the concentration of As in urine may be attributed to the higher As dosage rate per unit body weight in children than in adults .	24 12 1 2 241 127
10417365-10	These findings suggest that the analysis of a small number of urine samples may be adequate to estimate an individual's exposure to InAs from drinking water and that the determination of the concentration of InAs in a drinking water supply may be a useful surrogate for estimating exposure to this metalloid .	24 12 1 2 241 127
23664738-0	Pesticide exposure in urban low-income residential environments may be elevated as a result of persistent application due to severe pest infestation .	
23664738-1	Children living in this environment may be a sensitive subpopulation for these non-dietary exposures , due to their physiological and behavioral differences .	
23664738-2	In this study , we provide an exposure modeling framework to simulate exposures for children in this environment and assess dominant exposure routes and sources of exposure variability , in order to characterize factors that influence risk .	24 2 242
23664738-3	We use a dataset of pesticide measurements collected in 42 low-income dwellings , including vacuum dust and floor wipe samples from kitchens and living rooms .	24 2 242
23664738-4	We fit distributions to the concentration measurements for the organophosphates measured , chlorpyrifos and diazinon , and the most prevalent pyrethroids ( permethrin , cypermethrin , and cyfluthrin ) , and simulated 1000 homes from the distributions .	2 21
23664738-5	Concentration measurements were then connected with activity pattern data , short-term dermal and ingestion exposures and absorbed doses were simulated for children ages 1-5 years .	2 21 22
23664738-6	For both pesticide groups , exposure values ranged widely , with concentration values contributing most significantly to exposure variability , although approximately 20-fold variability was attributable to exposure factors alone .	
23664738-7	In addition , upper percentile exposed children usually had both higher concentrations as well as greater influences from exposure and dose factors .	
23664738-8	Differences were also seen across pesticide groups in dominant exposure pathways .	
23664738-9	Our analyses indicate a profile of factors that describe individuals likely to receive high doses of one or multiple pesticides and could allow for more targeted intervention strategies .	
23664738-10	More generally , this work provides a standard framework to evaluate and describe exposures to prevalent residential pesticides via multiple pathways .	2 21
23469879-0	Puerto Rico has higher rates of a range of endocrine-related diseases and disorders compared to the United States .	
23469879-1	However , little is known to date about human exposures to known or potential endocrine disrupting chemicals ( EDCs ) in Puerto Rico .	
23469879-2	We recruited 105 pregnant women in Northern Puerto Rico who provided urine samples and questionnaire data at three times ( 18 Â± 2 , 22 Â± 2 , and 26 Â± 2 weeks ) during gestation .	24 12 22 1 244 2 127
23469879-3	We measured the urinary concentrations of five phenols and three parabens : 2,4-dichlorophenol ( 24-DCP ) , 2,5-dichlorophenol ( 25-DCP ) , benzophenone-3 ( BP-3 ) , bisphenol A ( BPA ) , triclosan ( TCS ) , butyl paraben ( B-PB ) , methyl paraben ( M-PB ) , and propyl paraben ( P-PB ) .	1 12 127
23469879-4	The frequent detection of these chemicals suggests that exposure is highly prevalent among these Puerto Rican pregnant women .	1 12 127
23469879-5	Urinary concentrations of TCS , BP-3 , and 25-DCP were higher than among women of reproductive age in the US general population , while concentrations of BPA , 24-DCP , and parabens were similar .	1 12 127
23469879-6	Intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC ) varied widely between biomarkers ; BPA had the lowest ICC ( 0.24 ) and BP-3 had the highest ( 0.62 ) , followed by 25-DCP ( 0.49 ) and TCS ( 0.47 ) .	
23469879-7	We found positive associations between biomarker concentrations with self-reported use of liquid soap ( TCS ) , sunscreen ( BP-3 ) , lotion ( BP-3 and parabens ) , and cosmetics ( parabens ) .	24 244 2 22
23469879-8	Our results can inform future epidemiology studies and strategies to reduce exposure to these chemicals or their precursors .	
9417768-0	Quantitative examination of major pathways and routes of exposure to pesticides is essential for determining human risk .	
9417768-1	The current study was conducted in two apartments and examines the accumulation of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in childrens ' toys after the time suggested for reentry after application .	
9417768-2	It has been established for the first time that a semivolatile pesticide will accumulate on and in toys and other sorbant surfaces in a home via a two-phase physical process that continues for at least 2 weeks postapplication .	
9417768-3	A summation of the above for a 3-6-year-old child yielded an estimated nondietary total dose of 208 microg/kg/day .	2 21
9417768-4	Potential exposure from the inhalation pathway was negligible , while dermal and nondietary oral doses from playing with toys contributed to 39 and 61% of the total dose , respectively .	24 22 23 244 2 232
9417768-5	If children with high frequency mouthing behavior are considered as candidates for acute exposure to chlorpyrifos residues , the estimated acute dose could be as high as 356 microg/kg/day .	
9417768-6	Routine reapplication of pesticides could lead to continued accumulation in toys and other sorbant surfaces , e.g. , pillows , with large sorbant reservoirs , which can become a long-term source of exposure to a child .	
9417768-7	Estimates of a child's nondietary exposure to chlorpyrifos associated with toys and other sorbant surfaces for a period of 1 week following application appear to be of public health concern , and studies of actual childhood exposure from this pathway are warranted in the home environment .	
9417768-8	The above information should be used to determine if current procedures for postapplication reentry are sufficient and to evaluate the need for procedures to store frequently used household toys , pillows , and other sorbant objects during insecticidal application .	
20123613-0	BACKGROUND Because of the ubiquitous nature of phthalates in the environment and the potential for adverse human health effects , an urgent need exists to identify the most important sources and pathways of exposure .	
20123613-1	OBJECTIVES Using emissions of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP ) from vinyl flooring ( VF ) as an illustrative example , we describe a fundamental approach that can be used to identify the important sources and pathways of exposure associated with phthalates in indoor material .	
20123613-2	METHODS We used a three-compartment model to estimate the emission rate of DEHP from VF and the evolving exposures via inhalation , dermal absorption , and oral ingestion of dust in a realistic indoor setting .	24 242 2 22 23
20123613-3	RESULTS A sensitivity analysis indicates that the VF source characteristics ( surface area and material-phase concentration of DEHP ) , as well as the external mass-transfer coefficient and ventilation rate , are important variables that influence the steady-state DEHP concentration and the resulting exposure .	
20123613-4	In addition , DEHP is sorbed by interior surfaces , and the associated surface area and surface/air partition coefficients strongly influence the time to steady state .	
20123613-5	The roughly 40-fold range in predicted exposure reveals the inherent difficulty in using biomonitoring to identify specific sources of exposure to phthalates in the general population .	2
20123613-6	CONCLUSIONS The relatively simple dependence on source and chemical-specific transport parameters suggests that the mechanistic modeling approach could be extended to predict exposures arising from other sources of phthalates as well as additional sources of other semivolatile organic compounds ( SVOCs ) such as biocides and flame retardants .	
20123613-7	This modeling approach could also provide a relatively inexpensive way to quantify exposure to many of the SVOCs used in indoor materials and consumer products .
